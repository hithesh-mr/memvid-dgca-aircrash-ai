However, in the light of certain violations of the weather\n3\n\nminima, it was decided to modify this procedure.

There was no fire. ;\n\\ 1.4 OTHER DAMAGE\n; The helicopter crashed on the fish tank bund and the entire fuel carried in the\n\u00ae helicopter leaked into the fish tank. Fearing that the fish would die of fuel spillage, the owner\n: of the tank siphoned off the floating fuel and saved the fish.

Rahut, another very experienced pilot of the operator\nalso in no uncertain terms stated that even if one wants to come\ndirect outbound, there is no escape but to come overhead VOR and\nthen go on radial 217 and direct outbound does not mean that he\nwill not go overhead VOR (vide Q. 130 to 134).",

On being asked about the\ndanger of not having a morning pre-flight medical check-up,\nprompt came the reply from the Qantas that the pilots of the\nQantas Airways are so self-disciplined that such a check is not\nrequired. The Airways has framed a regulation that no pilot\nshould have a drink after 8 O'clock in the evening if they are oper-\nating any flight next day morning till noon- time and the pilots\nthemselves stop drinking as a matter of fact before that time and\nunder no circumstances shall continue with the drink after 8 p.m.\nIf the operator can introduce such a culture in its system, I\nam also inclined to believe that no pre-flight medical check-up\nwould be needed since trust and confidence on to the pilots can\nbring home itself the strictest of regulatory methods.\n1 4.",

(1ST) while on approach to Patna\nairport. The flight had taken off from Kolkata at 0650 hrs. and was on a\nscheduled flight to Delhi via Patna and Lucknow. Two Pilots, four Air-\nhostesses and 52 passengers were on board. Patna weather was clear with\na visibility of four kilometers. Approximately, 30 seconds prior to the\ncrash, the crew requested a 360\u00b0 turn due to being high on approach and\nwere cleared by the Air Traffic Controller on duty. The aircraft stalled\nshortly after commencing the 360\u00b0 turn and crashed in the Gardani Bagh\nresidential area. All the crew and 49 passengers were killed as a result of\nthe crash. The aircraft was completely destroyed by the crash and post\ncrash fire. Five persons on the ground lost their lives.",

The\naccident wiped out almost the entire family of Shri Surendra Nath, the then Governor of\nPunjab &\nHimachal Pradesh. Two years later Archana Airways L-410 aircraft VT-ETC\nmet with an accident on 11th\nJuly, 1996, killing 5 passengers and three crew members.\nIn the present accident all the five person on board lost their life.\nThese accidents ass .ime the importance for the fact that all the three accidents took place\nat almost the same place under the similar circumstances and in identical weather\nconditions .

The distortion was considered to be due\nto severe vibration (due to aircraft impact with the ground)\nwhich caused the signal to expand and contract in the time\ndomain (x-axis). The signal was analyzed and corrected until\nthe proper number of bits (960) was reached, without regard\nfor what the parameter values should be. subframe 330 had a\nvalid synchronizationt\nword at the beginning of the subframe\nand the next one in sequence at the beginning of subframe\n331.(cid:9)\nThe recording ended part way through subframe 331,\nduring the 26'th word where the signal was again distorted\nand it was determined that old data from 25 hours earlier\nbegan.\nThe data which follows trends show,'\nnnerally be considered\nvalid,(cid:9)\nright through to the end\no1 . _ording.

As this is\nlikely impossible to determine absolutely, one can only judge\nthe data by the trends it is following and try to assess it\nas it relates to the accident.\nAs for vertical acceleration which was specifically queried,\nit appears to follow a believable trend and\nI think that it .\nis therefore most probably valid,(cid:9)\nincluding the value of\n6.J25 g during the end of subframe 329.\n(cid:9) The vertical ac-\nceleration is recorded eight times lasecond and it can be a\nvery dynamic parameter by nature.(cid:9)\nIt is .possible that the\n(cid:9)\nCanada\n551\n\nimpact at 329 was greater than 6.125 g but was not recorded\ndue to the sampling rate of eight times per second.",
