CHAPTER - I
1. INTRODUCTION
This accident was unbelievable. VT-EUJ Super King B-200
aircraft crash is yet fresh, like festering wound. It is so easy and
perfect. Fly an aeroplane below the minimum level by deviating pre-
determined path and that too, in a mountainous region. Obviously
fatal accident would be the result.
On July 9, 1994, shock, anxiety and surprise sprung at the
highest possible tone from the news of the highly sophisticated
Beechcraft Super King Air B-200 aircraft with the state of art turbine
technology, crash in the mountainous region wherein destiny assumed
a most crucial dimensions wiping out in a flash almost entire family
of Shri Surendra Nath, the then Governor of Punjab and Himachal
Pradesh. After observing the formalities of filing the flight plan and
seeking start up clearances, Punjab Government Super King nine
seater airplane left Chandigarh at 0850 hours IST, though initially
scheduled to fly at 0800 hours IST when the weather was stated to
be though fine both at Chandigarh and Kulu, but with cumulus
clouds between Bilaspur and Sunder Nagar. In fact, rainy season had
set in and the weather condition in the valley was cloudy with
occasional rains. Before its arrival at Kulu (Bhuntar airport), the ill-
fated aircraft, one of the finest in the Beechcraft family, while
cruising at Flight Level 90, dashed against the trees on almost the
hill-top resulting into the immediate disintegration of the tail and
swooping thereof which further resulted into the hitting of the
airplane against a big boulder and catching fire near Serinala in
1

Kamrunag at a height of about 10,000 feet. The whereabouts of this
plane would have remained unknown, but for the solitary Gujjar
family, which saw the ill-fated plane crash, killing not only the
passengers aboard, but also the three crew members. The location
of the accident is about 25 nautical miles South of Kullu, which was
firstly identified by Capt. T.S. Gill, who picked up the beacons of the
crashed aircraft while returning from Leh to Delhi on the scheduled
Indian Airlines flight operating Airbus A-320. The wreckage of the
aircraft including bodies badly mutilated and mostly beyond
recognition, scattered in an area of 300 metres radius coupled with
the damaging, cutting and felling of 12 trees presented a horrible,
dazing and shocking state of affairs indicating to some extent the
manner and origin of the accident.
Shri Vikram Malhotra, son of late Shri Surendra Nath, one of
the passengers, had been posted as Deputy Commissioner of Kullu
about two months prior to the accident and he was to make
arrangement for the VIP visit. Shri Surendra Nath along with his
family was on a short holiday tour to Kullu and he had planned to
stay at the guest house of the Indo Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) at
Bandrol near Kullu on the high-way to Manali.
The plane was being piloted by Capt. R.D.S. Sandhu, Chief
Pilot and Capt. Pargat Singh, Senior Pilot as Co-Pilot; and Shri
Pandey, Flight Attendant was accompanying the passengers and the
crew members on board.
Shri V.K. Chandna, Director of Air Safety, Delhi Region, was
immediately appointed to act as Inspector of Accidents under Rule
71 of the Aircraft Rules, 1937 (hereinafter shortly referred to the
2

Rules). On his examination by this Court, he has proved his report,
exhibit PW 66/A wherein detailed preliminary findings analysing and
examining the facts in question have been given. Vide a notification
dated 29th July, 1994, issued by the Ministry of Civil Aviation,
Government of India, I was appointed to conduct the formal
investigation into the circumstances of the accident under Rule 75 of
the Aircraft Rules, 1937. Capt. D.K. Sharma, Chief Operations
Manager, Air Safety and Training, Vayudoot Ltd. and Shri K.B.
Batra, Chief Engineer (Air), Border Security Force, were appointed
as Assessors to assist the Court. Shri Ashok Sandev, Scientific
Officer, DGCA, was appointed to function as Secretary to the Court.
It would be appropriate to detail the material portion of aforesaid
Rule 75, which is as under :
"Rule 75 Formal Investigation
Where it appears to the Central Government that it is
expedient to hold a formal investigation of an accident,
it may, whether or not an investigation or an inquiry has
been made under Rule 71 or 74, by order direct a
formal investigation to be held and with respect to any
such formal investigation the following provisions shall
apply, namely :
i)(cid:9) The Central Government shall appoint a competent
person (hereinafter referred to as "the Court"), to hold
the investigation, and may appoint one or more persons
possessing, legal aeronautical engineering, or other
special knowledge to act as assessors, it may also direct
that the Court and the assessors shall receive such
remuneration as it may determine.
3

ii)(cid:9)
The Court shall hold the investigation in open Court in
such manner and under such conditions as the Court
may think most effectual for ascertaining the causes and
circumstances of the accident and for enabling the
Court to make the report hereinafter mentioned."
And further Rule 75 (6) reads as follows :-
`The Court shall make a report to the Central
Government stating its findings as to the cause of the
accident and the circumstances thereof and adding any
observations and recommendations which the Court
thinks fit to make with a view to the preservation of life
and avoidance of similar accidents in future, including,
a recommendation for the cancellation, suspension or
endorsement of any licence or certificate issued under
these Rules."
The nature of the investigation and the content/subject
matter of the investigation under the Indian Aircraft
Act and the Rules framed thereunder consist of an
open investigation to the parties to tender evidence, file
affidavits and also produce documents on which they
rely before the court. For any documents being not in
their possession, they can request the court for
procuring those documents. The Inquiry is of such a
nature that there is neither an accuser nor any accused,
there is in effect no lis inter se between the parties
approaching before the Commission.

In other words, the proceedings before these Court differed
from the normal judiciary proceedings, in that there are no
opposing sides here and this Court is not required to
adjudicate upon any dispute as no lis situation exist. Thus, it
is merely a fact finding inquiry and is neither accusatory nor
punitive. Thus, during the formal investigation whatever has
been stated, that has been done with a view to assist the Court
and not to advance the cause of any organisation or
participant. Thus the report of the Inspector of Accidents has
though formed the basis for this Court to proceed in the
inquiry, yet the focus of this Court is to remain fixed on the
accident in question as to what happened, how it happened
and why it happened. It is well said that suspicion is merely
a ground for scrutiny for evidence but it can never be a
ground of decision. Suspicion, howsoever, sound, cannot take
the place of proof. The scope of inquiry has also been made
clear in the ICAO Manual of Aircraft Accident Investigation,
Part-I, Chapter-I, which sets out the purpose thereof, inter
alia, as under :
"The fundamental purpose of inquiry into an Aircraft
Accident is to determine the facts, conditions and
circumstances pertaining to the accident with a view to
establishing the probable cause thereof, so that
appropriate steps may be taken to prevent a recurrence
of the accident and the factors which led to it. An
equally important purpose is to determine the facts,
conditions and circumstances pertaining to the survival
or non-survival of the occupants, and the crash
worthiness of the aircraft. The nature of the enquiry

into an aircraft accident should not be accusatory as the
object is to take remedial rather than punitive action;
similarly the assessment of blame or responsibility
should not be included in the duties of an Aircraft
Accident Investigation Authority since this function is
normally the prerogative of the judicial authorities of
the State concerned. Nevertheless, it is unavoidable
that acts of omissions, by individual persons or
organisations, are sometimes clearly revealed and in
such instances it is the duty of the inquiry to say so.
Any such statement should not confuse the purpose of
the aircraft Investigation which is primarily to indicate
what causes the accident rather than who causes it: this
should rightly be for others to decide."
Thus, the fundamental objective of the investigation of an
accident or an incident is the prevention of accidents and
incidents in future. However, this does not mean that this
court would turn a blind eye to any mistake made by the
people who may be found to have caused the accident or
contributed towards its occurrence. To do so would have
negated the very purpose of our investigation because, unless
we could establish, wrong action which led to the accident, we
cannot suggest any preventive measures for the future. Thus,
our general approach may be improved upon by saying that we
were determined to find out everything which was relevant to
the accident, but we were not so much interested within "who
did it" as we were keen to ascertain "why it happened". Our
comments in this report on the errors of individuals and

deficiencies in the organisations are not to suggest any punitive
action but to focus attention on areas needing preventive
measures in the interests of flight safety.
2. APPROACH OF THE COURT OF INQUIRY
Immediately upon being appointed to conduct this formal
investigation, I convened a meeting at Delhi on August 1, 1994. Shri
H.S. Khola, Director General of Civil Aviation accompanied with
S/Shri Satendra Singh, Deputy Director General Civil Aviation; V.K.
Chandna, Director Air Safety; Ashok Sandev, Secretary to the Court
of Inquiry, personally briefed me about the accident and the
investigation carried out by different agencies of the Government of
Himachal Pradesh, Government of Punjab and that of the Central
Government. During the meeting, photographs of the site of
accident depicting factual position existing thereof besides video film,
was also shown on the television set. I also directed Shri V.K.
Chandna, Inspector of Accidents to continue the investigation.
During the proceedings, we visited nine various places not only
in India, but also outside the country simply with a view to acquaint
ourselves with the functioning and operational management of the
various types of aeroplanes by the regulatory authorities and also
airline operators besides the steps taken by them in respect of safety
measures. It has been a well-worn visit to Wichita, USA and
Switzerland. How an aeroplane manufacturer engages itself in the
manufacture of a plane and in what manner training with respect to
the plane so manufactured is imparted to the pilots as also how an
airline operator behaves in its operational sphere having due regard
7

to the safety aspect is seen to be believed. The culture, the system
control, the outlook, the sincerity for the purpose together with
devotion to the concept of air passengers safety outweighs the Indian
culture in this behalf. It needs special mention. Public safety is pre-
dominant in Swiss culture. As a matter of fact, the entire operational
management is being administered by the flyers only. As in our
system, the executive pilots in Swiss Airlines do also fly but to a
limited extent in terms of hours in comparison to that of the line
pilots. This mode gives the Executive Pilots the time to devote on
to the organisational aspect and administrative works and thereby
they evolve the best safety measures.
I cannot but help noting another aspect even at this juncture
concerning the coordination between the civil and defence aviation
authorities with which they engage themselves in operational sphere
by giving priority to the air safety measures of the passengers. We
take the things as they are : we do not analyse the whole existing
situation in depth nor we have any inclination to give it a thought by
having a joint deliberations. We, in fact, lack cooperation and
cohesiveness in our administrative as also organisational system. We
want to continue with the existing system of the two wings working
and engaging themselves in operational spheres in their tightened
limits. We have entirely separate rules w.r.t. the administrative as
also organisational aspects of the aviation in civil and defence. There
exists no common ruler whereby technical, non-technical, operational
or non-operational employees of one wing may work or be adjusted
in the other/wing even on deputation. This aspect is also of utmost
significance which has arisen from the facts emerging from the
instant aircraft crash. Some device shall have to be evolved to
prevent such like occurrences. The time, therefore, now come to
8

view seriously as to the happenings particularly in the Civil Aviation
sector in the country and without losing any further time, a proper
introspection is needed to be effected. Several aircraft crashes have
attracted investigations through the Court of Inquiries constituted at
the behest of the Government and resultantly inquiry reports have
also come with quite a good number of recommendations emerging
therefrom. I am sure that Government must have also implemented
substantial number out of them yet there appears to be some snag
somewhere in our system. In these air-crashes, we have experienced
loss of several precious and invaluable human lives - Monetary
compensation or lip sympathy is no solution to this problem. We
shall have to rise up to the occasion to stop the recurrence of the
same, which is otherwise avoidable in nature.
The Inspector of Accidents also presented few reports relating
to past accidents for my perusal and apprised me of the progress of
his investigation. Number of queries relating to the accident in
question were raised, to which necessary explanation was provided.
It would be worthwhile to state that as all the crew members,
besides, the passengers had fatal injuries in the accident in question
and the aforesaid instrument did not have Cockpit Voice Recorder
(CVR) or Digital Flight Data Recorder (DFDR), this Court has to
determine and draw inferences as to the causes of the accident from
the circumstantial evidence consisting of oral as also documentary
evidence. Also various versions on the above said subject were being
published by editors of different newspapers circulated in this country
and as a high dignitary and his family had been the victims, this
Court considered it fit to hold a public inquiry in order to investigate
9

the causes thereof and to observe and make recommendations strictly
in accordance with Rule 75 of the Aircraft Rules, 1937.
Apart from it, the modalities relating to the proposed draft
notification inviting the views/information from the general public
were also prepared and approved by me and the Secretary of the
Court of Inquiry was then directed to get it published in all the
leading newspapers in English and preferably 'Punjab Kesari', Hindi
edition and some other local newspapers being widely circulated in
Himachal Pradesh. The Secretary to this Court of Inquiry was also
directed to contact the newspaper offices and also get their respective
versions along with the information as to the names and whereabouts
of the persons from whom their journalists got the respective versions
in relation to the cause(s) of the accident. Similarly, he was also
directed to contact police officials who investigated the matter at the
spot. As Punjab Government had also sent its officials for
conducting preliminary investigation, the Secretary was also asked to
contact them for getting their version. This Court also got the data
with respect to details of the flight by both the pilots of the aircraft
in question to Kullu during the past three years. Their interse
relationship data was also sought for.
In the next meeting held on August 18, 1994, discussions with
Shri H.S. Khola, Director General of Civil Aviation and his team
besides the Assessors and the Inspector of Accidents as also the
Secretary was held and various aspects of the accident were
discussed, consequent whereto Shri Ashok Sandev, the Secretary, was
directed to take the following actions:

i) A reminder be issued to all the Newspapers that whatever
information they have regarding the accident to Punjab
Government aircraft, be preserved with them as they are likely
to be called as a witness in the court.
ii) Features of B-200 aircraft vs. C-90 aircraft to be studied.
iii) Efforts to be made to get weather report from Kursog, Mandi
and Simla Observatories on the date of the accident.
iv) A query be made to Punjab Government to know the source
of information, they have relied upon in their letter
No.1/10/94-4T(3) dated the 16th August, 1994.
v) Pilot requirements for the aircraft weight less than 5700 kgs.
may be known.
vi) The manufacturer of the aircraft should be informed that they
can participate in the investigations, if they so desire.
vii) A letter to be written to Mr. Kureel, DIG, Simla for furnishing
the required information.
viii) Indamer Company be approached for sending the Pilot
Operating Handbook related to the Super King Air B-200
aircraft.
Punjab Government may be approached to send the Operation
Manual, Maintenance Manual and Pilot Operating Handbook.
In case of non-availability, these may be obtained.
11

In the subsequent meeting of August 19, 1994, the Border
Security Force hangar at IGI Palam, New Delhi, was visited by me
along with the Assessors, the Secretary and the Inspector of
Accidents, besides, the concerned officers of the said airport. I
familiarised myself with salient features, construction and working of
the aircraft in detail through the Inspector of Accidents Shri V.K.
Chandna, as also the staff and officers of the Border Security Force,
who keenly participated in the inspection conducted by me followed
by discussion with respect thereto. On the following day, during
discussions, Shri V.K. Chandna aforesaid, explained in details the
functions and the status of various parts of the fateful aircraft,
consequent to which action with respect to various factors was
directed to be taken by the Secretary in the following terms :
i) How much time does an Engineer take for checking the
aircraft before the flight takes off?
ii) What is the rate of climb at 9,000 feet at that atmospheric
conditions and aircraft weight conditions?
iii) Forest Department may be requested to estimate the angle of
cut at which the trees were cut at the accident site by the
aircraft.
iv) How many passengers were on-board?
v) Request for entire ATC Transcript right from the first
conversation.
12

vi) What is the rule position with regard to passengers on-board
vis-a-vis ATC?
vii) Photocopies of the statements of duty officer of ATC,
Chandigarh/Barnala and Flight Despatcher of Punjab
Government.
On September 3, 1994, we visited Chandigarh in order to get
information with respect to the aircraft, its pilots and the conduct of
the business conducted by the Government of Punjab with respect to
high dignitaries as also the manner of use of the aircraft in relation
thereto such persons. Resultantly, the meeting was held wherein Shri
J.S. Maini, Principal Secretary to the Chief Minister, Government of
Punjab, besides, other officers including Mrs. A.C. Duggal, Director
Civil Aviation, was held in Punjab Bhavan. Both the Principal
Secretary and Director Civil Aviation belonging to the Government
of Punjab hail from Indian Administrative Service cadre. A meeting
was held and information with respect to the working of the Civil
Aviation Organisation, the staff and the rules followed by the
Operator was sought for. On our visit to Air Force station and ATC
Tower Chandigarh, we also got the weather forecast, the Met. and
other civil aviation working briefing. This discussion related in giving
various directions to the Secretary of this Court to contact operators
like M/s Jagson and Archana Airways and also Air Force Authorities,
Barnala and Delhi, besides, the Chief Engineer of the Civil Aviation
Punjab Government with respect to aircraft C-90 from his Office
located at Patiala. On the following day, this Court along with the
Assessors and Inspector of Accidents also visited Alpha Control
Barnala for on the spot study of the facilities and equipments
available there. Gp. Capt. P. Singh, Station Commander; Sq. Ldr.
13

R.S. Chhatwal and Sq. Ldr. Manmohan Upadhyay explained in detail
the functioning of the Alpha Control and the object underlined
thereunder. We were informed that their objective is to intercept the
enemy airplane and take the appropriate action. In respect of the
civilian aircraft, we were informed that their aim is that such aircraft
does not drift to the territory of the neighbouring countries and
ensure that no traffic conflict take place with the Defence aircraft.
It was made clear that neither they are qualified as Air Traffic
Controllers nor they are supposed to do any traffic control. In case,
any level change is done by them, it is so done with the consent of
the Delhi and Chandigarh ATCs. In other words, they apprised this
Court that their role is advisory in nature. In addition, they also
informed that the aircraft blip is visible only upto Bilaspur and after
that it is not clear due to hill shadows. Regarding division of ATC
number, they informed that in case of change in departure time the
number remains the same. However, they change the timings and
accept the flight. In respect of the aircraft in question, this Court
was apprised that the Pilot-in-Command was following Pre-
Determined Route (PDR) at 015 degree from Chandigarh to Kullu
at flight level 90. According to them, generally all the aircraft follow
this route. They further qualified their information by stating that
these days i.e. the period when inspection was conducted, the aircraft
flight had a higher level. They also expressed that even they should
have better communication facility like STD, hot-line with Kullu for
better traffic management. We also observed a flight on radar of
Archana Airways operating from Delhi to Kullu in order to apprise
ourselves with respect to the information sought for and consequent
directions given by the Officers of the aforesaid Alpha Control. The
aircraft was also viewed on the Route 015 at a level of 130 which
flight level was chosen by the commander because of the clouds
14

between Bilaspur and Sundar Nagar. Information was also sought
for from Shri Balvinder Singh, the then Flight Despatcher, though
ultimately, now, has been found to be unapproved one by the
Director General of Civil Aviation, New Delhi and also from Capt.
Mehra, Junior Pilot and Sandeep Bhatia. On September 9, 1994, we
conducted a meeting with the officials of M/s Pawan Hans Limited,
New Delhi, in order to acquaint ourselves with regard to the training
in instrument flying through their simulator. For that purpose, an
exercise of simulator flying was also shown to us by Simulator
Instructor Shri Maini. He also explained us as to how the flying is
done by standing various instruments and simulation of emergency.
We also had discussions with respect to VFR and IFR flying. On the
subsequent day, we thought it to have a meeting with the officials of
National Airports Authority. After explaining the purpose of visit i.e.
to see the radar facilities, FIC functioning, search and rescue centres
and to seek from the ATC expert suggestions for meeting the safety
standards with respect to air travel. The concerned officer of the said
authority explained us the various facilities provided at the airport,
functioning of the Flight Information Centre located there and also
told us that their role is that of advisory in nature. We were also
acquainted with the fact that the purpose of FIC number was to
ensure that the flight plan has been received and that the actual time
of departure is known to them for providing better service. It was
also stated that FIC number remains valid for half an hour. At the
same time, they explained the difficulties being faced by them with
respect to coordination between Air Force Station and National
Airports Authority airports in relation to the civil flights. We also
visited "Approach Control Radar" and "Area Control, Search and
Rescue Centre" where we found that FC-10 was not manned even at
the time of our visit. The concerned authorities informed us that it
15

was due to shortage of staff. Shri S.A. Ram, Director of Aerodrome,
National Airports Authority, also gave us a write up about the
functioning and the responsibilities of the FIC and regarding
acceptance of the flight plans and responsibilities thereof. A flight
plan pertaining to Archana Airways flight to Kullu was also perused.
We also saw the working of MLC and MLU units. We found that
MLU unit gives ATC number and has a hot-line with Barnala. On
the other hand, we were apprised that MLC unit only coordinates
with the Defence aircrafts. In the subsequent meeting held in the
Office of Inspector General of Air Force at West Block, R.K. Puram
on 12.9.1994, the concerned Director Flight Safety apprised us
regarding the submission of the civil flight plans and the role of
Alpha control in relation thereto. Air Marshal D.R. Nadkarni and
Air Cdr. I.J.S. Boparai participated in this meeting. In relation to
the coordination for civil flights between authorities of Defence
airfields and civil airfields, this Court found organisational vacuum
in terms of lack of coordination. On persuasion with respect to the
urgent need of coordination between the two wings of aviation i.e.
civil and Defence, Air Cdr. Boparai assured us that he shall also look
into the matter for taking corrective actions. However, we were
informed that there existed lack of communication facilities between
Chandigarh and Bhuntar. He also suggested that there should be
trial landings by the pilots at such aerodromes where he has not
operated for a long time. According to him, facilities at Chandigarh
and Bhuntar airfields should be provided in line similar to that of
Srinagar route. It was also suggested that the orange colour
balloons should be installed at number of positions which eventually
would help the pilots flying in that area to become alert. According
to him, installation of a radar on this route somewhere in the
Himachal hill range is also necessary for improvement of safety
16

measures in the northern sector. During the proceedings, it was felt
necessary by this Court to know about the manufacturing process of
the fateful aircraft and the nature of the training imparted to the
pilots in general and also in respect of the both pilots handling the
said aircraft on the fateful day in particular. As the aircraft in
question was manufactured by Raytheon Company (Beechcraft)
Flight Safety International, Wichita, USA, and both the pilots had
been trained to fly the aircraft in question on simulators installed at
that place and also there being no such simulator in India, it was
decided to visit the said place for seeking information on various
systems employed in manufacturing such aircraft and imparting
training to the pilots engaged in flying on such aircrafts.
Simultaneously, as the aircraft flying in the mountainous region
located in Switzerland is quite prevalent and as there are various
airports in close vicinity in that country, we felt it necessary to visit
the said place to apprise ourselves regarding operation and safety
measures in the hill flying. We also observed that the operation
regulations applicable to the flying of aircraft in Switzerland are
similar to that as per the guidelines of ICAO. It also formed one of
the reasons for our intended visit to the aforesaid two countries
during the period from November 30 to December 9, 1994. As per
the programme sorted out, we had meetings and discussions with the
concerned authorities of the aforesaid manufacturers, operators etc.
Following are the points which emerged during the discussions/visit
at the above said places:
VISIT TO RAYTHEON FACTORY (Wichita, USA)
At this factory the different models of Beechcraft are
manufactured. A visit to the plant was made and steps of
17

manufacturing and assembly procedure of the aircrafts were
witnessed.(cid:9) A discussion was held with the various
representatives and officials of Beechcraft Company. The
specialists on various system and the Test Pilot on King Air
aircraft participated in the discussion along with the
Beechcraft Investigators including their legal expert.
Following points emerged during the discussions :
i) Beechcraft representative agreed to supply the details of
manufacturing of the involved aircraft.
ii) The normal climb rate is around 2100 feet per minute
_ (cid:9) while cruising at 9,000 feet.
iii) For the hilly terrain flying under VFR conditions, pilot
has to ensure visual contact all the times and omega
navigation will not be of help under those conditions.
iv) Beechcraft agreed to supply the data in respect of the
accident in bad weather/collision with the hills.
Beechcraft agreed to give a note on affect of CG
positions on handling/performance characteristics of the
aircraft.
vi)(cid:9) Regarding pressurisation of the aircraft the aircraft
could be pressurised while at 9,000 feet at the rate of
2,000 feet per minute.
18

VISIT TO FLIGHT SAFETY INTERNATIONAL, WICHITA
This facility is full fledged set up for providing training to the
pilots. Ground training, simulator flying and aircraft flying is
available to the trainees at this institution. The training
contents are approved by FAA. Discussions were held with
Capt. Dan Orlando who is rated pilot-cum-instructor on the
Super King aircraft. Exercises on the simulator of Super King
Aircraft were carried out to simulate the accident flight.
(a) Simulator Flying
Various exercises were planned with different all-up-
weight (5500 kgs., 5300 kgs., 5100 kgs.) at normal
cruising speed (210 knots) with centre of gravity
position at around 19.26%. An abrupt maximum pull
up was carried out while cruising at 9,000 feet to climb
upto 9,400 feet (height at which crash took place) with
auto-pilot engaged and with auto-pilot disengaged.
Time taken/pitch angle, speed at 9,400 were recorded.
The print out were taken for various exercises. While
going through various exercises, it was observed that
with auto-pilot engaged the pitch angle was around 40
degree while with auto-pilot disengaged the pitch up
angle had gone upto 55 degrees. It was also observed
that the speed had washed down to 180 knots while
reaching at 9,400 feet (similar to what was observed on
speed indicator in the wreckage of the crashed aircraft).
The time taken to climb to 9,400 feet was approximately
3.54 seconds to 3.75 seconds. This experiment indicated
19

that auto-pilot was engaged when the pilot pulled up
the control column to avoid the collision as the pitch
angle achieved was 40 degree and the same was
observed on the cutting angle on the trees by the
aircraft at the crash site. The visibility estimated in the
area where the collision took place was of the order of
approx. 1,000 feet.
Speaking for myself, I jotted down my inspection note
with respect to the exercise carried out in the simulator
at Wichita and the discussions held there as also at
Zurich. My observation in this regard are as under :
"A state-of-the-art facility, Super King B-200
engineering simulator housed at the Beechcraft
Aeronautical Training Establishment Witchita is stated
to have played a major role in imparting trouble-free
training to the pilots with respect to aircrafts
manufactured by them. A speciality worked out for
Super King B-200 and already incorporated in the
simulator is the system of head-up and head-down
displays with the help of which pilots can see through
the factual situation in front of their eyes flight readings
will also surface.
Taking off, landing, rolling and pitching, the simulator
enveloped in front by a 3-D view seems unconvincingly
closed to piloting a real aircraft. In other words myself
along with other sitting in the cockpit and the aircraft
only a simulator Super King B-200 veered sharply on its
20

journey in front for taking off from the airfield runway
away (cid:9) and we were in the sky. Thus by the
simulator we not only evaluated the normal speed,
weight and the uplift speed after forcefully but
instantaneously putting the sticks after setting it in the
conditions found the factual position revealed by the
various instruments/equipment fitted in the fateful
aircraft, but also compared the ultimate results
concluded from the exercises conducted therein with the
actual digital revalidating. There was not even a
minimal difference therein which shows that simulators
in recent years have played a major role not only in
improving the particular aircraft but also in imparting
training to the pilots who wanted to operate it. Both
the pilots in question were trained in this institute.
Thus, simulators are converted into a training apparatus
from the design-oriented vehicle."
(b) Discussion regarding pilot training and regulations:
Following points came out during discussion with Capt.
Orlando:-
The pilots were given training as per the FAA
approved syllabus on simulator and other training
material.
21

ii) Though Omega equipment is not fitted on the
simulator, a separate training was given on the
omega equipment installed in the class-room.
iii) It was for the DGCA to ensure that pilot had
undergone necessary training and also day and
night flying on the aircraft before endorsement
for the aircraft on the pilot licence.
iv) As per the FAA regulations for the private flying
where no public is involved, no route checks are
called for with respect to mountainous flying etc.
However, Beech Company have made necessary
for pilots to undergo route check for route
destination and difficult airfields.
c)(cid:9) Visit to Zemix Aviation and Federal Office of Civil
Aviation, Zurich, Switzerland
a)(cid:9) Discussion with Zemix Aviation :
Zemix Aviation is a Swiss registered firm under
the regulatory control of Switzerland and it
carries out the operations in oil installations.
The discussions were carried out with Capt. Nick
Hater regarding operation and safety measures
adopted in the hill flying in Switzerland.
Following points emerged:-
22

i) In Switzerland the aircraft flying in the
valley is quite prevalent and as there are
various airports in close vicinity, the
navigation is quite safe.
ii) The operation regulations are similar to
that as per the guidelines of ICAO.
iii) At the VFR airfields pattern of flying have
been defined at the airport.
iv) For difficult terrain like dessert, flying
training for the same is given before the
pilot is released for operation in that area.
d)(cid:9) Discussion with Federal Office of Civil Aviation
Discussions were held with capt. B. Balsiger, Chief Of
Flight Operations in Switzerland. Following points
emerged during discussions:-
For the pilots operating aircraft below 5,700 kgs.
weight of aircraft, no proficiency check is called
for similar to that of ICAO regulations.
b)(cid:9) There are no special regulations for the aircraft
operations for the private operators when they
carry VIP on board, however, there is an
understanding that they will follow similar control
23

of the operation of aircraft similar to that of
_ (cid:9) commercial aircraft operations.
c) There are no instructions for trial landing for the
new destination. However, a detailed briefing by
the experienced pilot shall suffice.
d) There are no separate regulations for the VIP
aircraft operations.
We also conducted an inspection of M/s Indamer Company,
Bombay, on March 2, 1995, and meeting with the participation of
Shri Montero and Shri H.B. Singh, the responsible officer belonging
to the said company. Mr. Montero, Quality Control Manager, gave
introduction describing the salient features of the aircraft and also
with respect to the details of the level and procedures followed on
the aircraft type in question. The radio engineer working in this
company gave us the details of avionics installed in the aircraft in
question. We also perused and attempted to understand the specific
details of weather radar functioning and its utility in detecting the
obstruction in the flight in bad weather conditions, regarding which
we also had lengthy discussions. Capt. Srivastava, who flew aircraft
of the type in question also participated in the discussions. We also
pointedly discussed other aspects regarding fuel quality check, rate
of flying, seating configuration and limitation of number of
passengers carried and effect of centre of gravity, checks on pilots for
flying in hilly terrain. The crux of the discussions was that seating
configuration depended upon the desire of the operator. However,
the aircraft in question was certified for maximum number of 12
seats configuration, though it had only 9 seats with safety belts
24

provided therein. We have also observed earlier that seating
configuration of the aircraft in question was seven passengers besides
the crew members. We were apprised by Capt. Srivastava that the
limiting factor with respect to this aspect was all-up-weight in which
variables like fuel, weight, passenger weight and the baggage weight
is adjusted. He also told us that number of persons are usually
restricted to number of seating belts and at centre of gravity position
always depended upon the low distribution.
According to him, the engineers and pilots are required to be
trained on all the equipments/aids. He also suggested that there
should be a refresher course for both pilots and engineers and that
in case of a new type of aircraft where the different instruments/aids
are fitted, the pilots and engineers must get training. The pilots in
particular, as per his statement, required to be trained on aircraft
during day and night. He also told us that fuel vendor duly approved
by Director General of Civil Aviation usually keep check and shown
the fuel quality used in the aircraft by the operators. He gives a
certificate as to weather fuel quality so used was contaminated or
not. Maintenance facility wing of the aforesaid Indamer Company
was also visited by us. In addition to the above, we also conducted
inspection at Central Training Establishment at Hyderabad on March
10, 1995. We observed functioning of the simulator at that place too
and had useful discussions with Shri Reddy.
Pre-Conference Meeting of the Court was also held at Punjab
Bhavan, Chandigarh before material evidence was recorded at
various places. Meanwhile, the Secretary of the Court of Inquiry was
directed to issue a public notice that whoever have a knowledge and
desires to make a representation concerning the circumstances or
25

cause of the accident, may do so in writing in the form of an affidavit
duly attested and address the same to the Secretary so as to reach
him within a fortnight of the publication of the notice. A public
notice was accordingly published inviting informations from the
public in general and persons desirous of imparting information w.r.t.
aircraft crash in question. In addition, they were also directed to
submit their suggestions with respect to any other aspect/angle which
might be relevant for proceeding further in the inquiry in question
within ten days. Such suggestions were directed to be filed
personally or through post to the Secretary, Court of Inquiry.
Accordingly, a notice in the following terms was published :
The Government of India vide its Notification
No.AV.15013/8/94-SSV, dated 29th July, 1994, has
appointed Hon'ble Mr. Justice D.P. Sood of the
Himachal Pradesh High Court to investigate the causes
of accident to Punjab Government Super King Air B-
200 Aircraft VT-EUJ near Kullu on 9.7.1994.
Any person having direct or relevant knowledge or
information about the said accident or the causes or
circumstances leading to the said accident, or knowledge
or information which may lead to the determination of
the cause of or circumstances leading to the said
accident, or who may or is likely to be affected by the
findings of the Court of Inquiry, may furnish, a
statement in writing to the court of Inquiry.
Any person furnishing the statement shall also furnish
to Court of Inquiry along with the statement, the list of
26

documents, if any, on which he/she proposes to rely and
forward to the Court of Inquiry wherever practicable,
originals or true copies of such of the documents as may
be in his/her possession or power and shall state the
names and addresses of the persons from whom the
remaining documents may be obtained.
The statement and list of documents, if any, shall be
delivered personally or through an authorised agent or
sent by registered post at the Office of the Secretary,
court of Inquiry, Office of the Director General of Civil
Aviation, Technical Centre, Opposite Safdarjung
Airport, New Delhi(cid:9) 110 003 on or before 5th
September, 1994.
The witness shall be examined either on affidavit or on
his appearance in person in the court. The expenses, if
any, shall be borne by the Court."
The help of my staff while functioning as a sitting Judge of the High
Court of Himachal Pradesh and even after I demitted the office on
March 30, 1995, with the permission of the Hon'ble Chief Justice of
High Court of Himachal Pradesh, on two sittings at Chandigarh,
particularly for recording the evidence of material witnesses, was
sought. Thereafter as no staff in the shape of stenographer or any
other person except gunman was provided to me and also as the
entire record throughout the proceedings remained with the
Secretary to the Court of Inquiry under my orders and the Secretary
as also both the Assessors were stationed at Delhi thus in the
absence of staff particularly a senior stenographer or even a minimal
27

staff with me, I deemed it fit in the interest of justice to continue my
sittings at Delhi for the purpose of preparing the report and
submission thereof.
There has been numerous sittings of the Court at Shimla,
Mandi, Chandigarh etc. and over 90 witnesses have deposed before
the Court. Apart from the Report of the Inspector of Accidents,
numerous documents have been placed during the proceedings by the
Inspector of Accidents, witnesses, participants and others.
Participants were afforded opportunity to file affidavits, inspect
documents/exhibits and cause witnesses to be examined. The court
has spared no effort and every aspect of the matter has been brought
up for thorough investigation. This summary draws upon the
affidavits and testimony of the witnesses and other matters before the
Court, including reports, documents, test data, ICAO documents,
AIP, AICs etc. as have relevance.
This Court had accorded participant status to the Airports
Authority of India after merger of National Airports Authority of
India and National Airports Authority with effect from 1.4.1995.
After the collection of the evidence, this Court has heard all the
parties through their learned counsels at length. They have also
submitted their respective written submissions. We have given our
thoughtful consideration to the entire material before us.
From the deep analysis thereof, we feel that for stepping up
safety measures, the operators organisational structure needs to be
revamped for various factors discussed in the report. The purpose
behind it is that a culture is introduced, which would by itself negate
any chance of risk and will promote safety. The details of the study
28

undertaken by me at Wichita and Switzerland have also been
highlighted in this regard. Suffice it to note, however, that the
regulatory authority ought to exist only for the purpose of supervision
of the whole system in its letter and spirit and mainly the operator
is required to concentrate and evolve a system of safety by which air
travel in this country may become safe as in USA and in Switzerland.
Speaking for myself, I am not prepared to accept that we lack
efficiency in any way, but what we lack is the system, control and the
management and the operator should, now, give it a thought in order
to bring home the concept of safety in the minds of air passengers,
which is in a gradual decline at present.

CHAPTER-II
3. FACTUAL INFORMATION
3.1 History of The Flight
Background
Punjab Government Beech Super King Air B-200
aircraft VT-EUJ, which was on a flight from
Chandigarh to Bhuntar (Kulu) on 9.7.1994, met with an
accident at about 0905 IST and crashed near the top of
a hill about 10 NM south-east of Sundar Nagar,
Himachal Pradesh. The aircraft disintegrated and
caught fire after impacting with tall trees and rocks on
top of the hill. There were 13 persons on board,
including 3 members of crew. The passengers included
Shri Surendra Nath, the then Governor of Punjab and
Himachal Pradesh and 9 members of his family. All
persons on board received fatal injuries.
Details of Flight
The aircraft was under the command of Capt. R.D.S.
Sandhu with Capt. Pargat Singh as his Co-Pilot. Shri
Balwindar Singh, the Flight Despatcher of the Punjab
Government had filed the Flight Plan for the ensuing
flight. The aircraft was to operate sectors Chandigarh-
Bhuntar-Chandigarh-Ludhiana-Chandigarh on July 9,
1994. At 0846 hours IST, Chandigarh tower gave start
up clearance and informed aircraft that runway in use
30

is 11, QNH Chandigarh 29.55 inches and further aircraft
to change over to approach frequency of 122.3 MHz.
The aircraft took off from Chandigarh at 0850 hours
1ST for the flight to Bhuntar. (While it was taxiing,
Pilot contacted Archana Airways aircraft which was on
flight. On inquiry he informed Pilot-in-Command of
aircraft in question that there were cumulous clouds
between Bilaspur and Sundar Nagar). Thereafter at
0853 hours IST, it reported overhead at Flight Level 70
that he was setting the course to Bhuntar. ATC
Chandigarh informed about the estimates for which the
Punjab Government aircraft replied as abeam Bilaspur.
Thereafter it remained in contact with Air force SIS
Unit, Barnala till 0903 hours IST which was the last
transmission. Earlier at 0902 hours IST, the Air Force
SIS had advised the PIC to contact Bhuntar airport and
the same was acknowledged by the later. As per the
record, both PIC and his Co-Pilot were new to the
route with the newly acquired aircraft in question.
Details of Crash
After Bilaspur, the flight "appears to have moved off
from the track" (from the pre-determined flight path) as
pilot probably could not see anything in the immediate
vicinity due to poor visibility weather conditions.
The aircraft hit a number of tall trees about 40 feet
height from ground level and chopped off nearly 12
31

trees before hitting the rocky mountain surface. The
smashed cockpit was found about 600 metres away from
the point of impact. However, most of the instruments
were traceable from the location. The position of
throttle was found in full forward position as if the
pilot had been trying to climb up. The resultant impact
have sheared off the main body (fuselage) exposing the
passengers to the open. The speed of the aircraft was
estimated to be at 220 knots and passengers getting
exposed after shearing off the cockpit resulted
disintegration of human bodies into many pieces.
Death would have been instant due to impact and
resultant disintegration of the human bodies. The
exposed fuselage had travelled approximately 800
metres before it rested close to the house of Shri
Jeethu, a "Gujjar" residing on a slope of the hill. He
and his family were witnesses to the crash scene. It was
the same Gujjar who reported the details of crash to the
police after trekking about 10 kilometres from the
scene.
The wreckage of aircraft was shattered along the flight
path from the point of impact. The wing and 2 engines
were found nearly 900 metres away from the point of
impact. They were partly burnt, probably on impact.
The fire was not very intense.
Immediately area and leaves of trees/bushes around the
point of impact were found blackened due to spillage of
32

fuel. There is no sign of serious fire at the site of
impact.
The lighter and fragile wreckage were found in the
immediate vicinity along the direction of flight path
from the point of impact. The wreckage were
splintered into small pieces and found in a funnel
covering approximately 800 metres. The most of
cushions and other inflammable furnishing of the
aircraft were found unburnt except two.
There were no significant wreckage found before hitting
the trees/point of impact.
Terrain
Kamrunag hills are series of steep hills, height ranging
from 8,000 feet to 11,200 feet. The height at the point
of impact as per altimeter setting of the aircraft was
9,400 feet. The area is covered with thick vegetation
and tall trees. Nearest approach to the site is from a
place called "Chowki" where the elevation is around
6,400 feet. The route from Chowki to the scene of
crash was treacherously steep, slippery and slushy and
was very difficult to negotiate.
The area at the point of impact was rocky covered with
tall trees. The aircraft after hitting the tall trees and
chopping about 12 trees hit a rock and disintegrated.
33

(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)
The parts of the aircraft were thrown off along the
flight path.
There is no inhabitation except a bunker type of house
where a "Gujjar and his family" stayed. The house was
nearly 900 metres from the point of impact but facing
towards the scene where the wreckage were scattered.
The area where the cockpit and fuselage were drifted
were free of vegetation/trees but full of small rocks and
boulders.

Upper Rating Speeds
As per the manufacturers, this aircraft qualifies as one of the most
manoeuvrable corporate airplanes in the world. It can be handled
with ease in all flight regimes and sturdy construction techniques
contribute to the following figures (calculated at maximum take off
weight) MTW - 12,500 Pounds.
Rates of Climb
The Super King Air delivers an extra margin of confidence through
the powerful PT6A jet-prop engines (the following figures of rate of
climb are calculated at full gross weight) :

(cid:9)
Two Engines above 35,000 ft.
(cid:9)
One Engine 21,900 ft.
(cid:9)
Cabin Pressurization 6.5 psi
Range
The average stage length of most corporate flights is approximately
350 statute miles. The Super King Air can handle four such stage
lengths, at maximum cruise power and with four passengers on
board, without refuelling. You may never need the 2,272 mile range
of the B200, but it will help save time between stages by cutting turn-
around time to only minutes.
Reported Defects of the Aircraft
As per the statement of Shri M.P. Chacko AME 2803 the aircraft
had no reported defect since it came to India.
Modifications and life limited components
1.(cid:9) No mandatory modifications/inspections were outstanding at
the time of the accident.
49

2.(cid:9) Life limited components of the aircraft and engines were
within the prescribed/approved limit.
Communication Instruments
The communication equipment aboard the airplane is integrated into
various systems utilised to convey audible information between
ground facilities, the airplane's crew, and passengers. The VHF
radios provide airport and airways communications.
Auto-Flight
The auto-pilot provides stabilization in pitch and roll during normal
climb, cruise and approach conditions. Functions of the auto-pilot
include heading and altitude control, VOR beam coupler, glide-slope
coupler, and turbulence penetration. The basic mode of the auto-
pilot operation permits the pilot to introduce pitch and roll
commands to the auto-pilot through movement of the control column
and control wheel. This feature is known as control wheel steering
and is utilised in place of the turn and pitch controller.

Nagar. After Sunder Nagar there was a break.
He has stated that the enroute weather on that day was
partly cloudy only and easily negotiable. The clouds
were mostly broken 2 to 3 octas stratus and strato-
53

cumulous; except between Bilaspur and Sunder Nagar,
there was continuous layered clouding covering the hill
tops. In fact at level 80 (on QNH), he had to deviate
about 5 NM right of track to stay above the clouds,
between Sunder Nagar and Bilaspur.
The tape transcript indicates that at time 0846 IST VUJ
contacted VTB (Archana Airways aircraft) while

3.8 Aids To Navigation
The only navigational aid available at Bhuntar airfield (Kulu)
is NDB frequency 334 Khz, which was serviceable on the date
of accident. The accident flight though as per the Flight Plan
was intended to be conducted under IFR, but as per the
submissions made by learned counsels appearing for the
parties, it had been conducted under visual references. No
navigational aids were involved in the accident in question.
However, there were no reported difficulties with the aids at
the material time.
56

3.9 Communications
There were no reported difficulties between ATC and the
aircraft or alpha control and the plane in question.
Chandigarh airport is equipped with tower and approach
frequencies. The tower frequency being 120.5 MHz and that
of approach being 122.7 MHz. The aircraft was in two-way
communication as Chandigarh till 0857 IST, after which it
switched over to 'A Control'. The tape transcript of the
communication with Chandigarh ATC has also been produced
in evidence.
The aircraft in question then came in contact with 'A' Control
Barnala in two-way communication with it which is equipped
with Radar. The tape transcript of the communication has
also been submitted as a part of the documentary evidence in
the report of Shri V.K. Chandna, PW-66, the said report being
PW-66/A. The Flight Path followed by the aircraft was also
observed by the Radar Controller and the diagram showing
the flight path has also formed part of the report aforesaid.
It would be appropriate to state that we also conducted an
exercise to know the flight path followed by the usual aircraft
going in routine from Chandigarh to Bhuntar airfield. We
found that the aircraft in question had deviated from the route
path from the routine flights which are conducted in
accordance with visual flight rules.

The radio range at Bhuntar airport is limited due to
mountainous terrain. As per the statement of Shri Amit Goel,
Aerodrome Officer of Bhuntar airport, PW, he had no firm
details of Governors flight nor aircraft was in contact with Air
Traffic Control
He had also not received any official message from
Chandigarh nor Delhi on telephone regarding the VIP flight.
Record shows that normally the aircraft remain in radio
contact with ATC till it reaches about 20 kilometres within the
vicinity of airport.
3.10 Aerodrome Information
Chandigarh
Chandigarh airport is about 12 kms from the city at an
elevation of 1029 feet. It has one runway 11/29. The length

Bhuntar
Bhuntar aerodrome situated in Himachal Pradesh is controlled by
Airports Authority of India. The runway is AO feet long and hence
only small aircraft operate from it. It is manned by Aerodrome
Officer and one Aerodrome Assistant. The airfield as indicated
above, is equipped with NDB. In July, 1994, one flight was being
operated daily to and from this airport by an Air Taxi Operator. As
per Aeronautical Information Circular 16 of 1992, this aerodrome is
fit for VFR operations only.
While proceeding from Chandigarh, Mandi town comes on the way
to Bhuntar airfield. This town has a small strip, which is casually
used as airfield but it does not have essential aids like ILS
(Instrument Landing System) or VOR (Visual Omni Range).
3.11 Flight Recorders
Flight Recorders were neither available nor were required to
be installed in this type of aircraft as the all-up-weight of the
aircraft is below 5700 Kgs.
3.12 Wreckage Information
The information about it has already been given in extenso
under the heading 'Details of Crash' (A-1-3(i)). Inspection of
the wreckage site indicated the chopping up of 12 trees

From the inspection of the Air Speed Indicator, the speed of
the aircraft was indicated at 189 kts. which prime facie show
that the aircraft was travelling at high speed. The aircraft was
found to be at a climbing attitude at about 40 degrees. At the
time of impact with the trees as indicated by the attitude
indicator and the cutting angle of the trees which was cut at an
upward slope by the aircraft and its path. All trim tabs were
in near neutral position indicating that controls were
functioning normal. The aircraft could be pulled up in nose
up position only by a properly functioning elevator. Flap
selector and flap actuator were in 'UP' position. All control
cables were stretched and broken indicating all adjustment
points were properly secured. As per the report of the
Inspector of Accidents (PW-66), damages on propeller blades
indicated high speed rotation damage, condition lever were out
of detent and were between high idle and low idle indicating
engines but not cut off. Both power levers and propeller
levers were in cruise (high power) positions. Altimeter was
showing 9,400 feet and radio altimeter showed 35 feet. RMI
65

indicated the heading at 010 degree and the single pointer
revealed bearing of 210 degrees. The HSI of the Co-Pilot
indicated a selection of 016 degrees heading.
The landing gears were in fully retracted position at the time
of impact. In fact, the entire aircraft had been damaged due
to its having gutted in fire accepting the instruments which
were found in the wreckage on the site in the condition
explained above.
3.13 Examination for Explosion
The Bomb Detection and Disposal Squad, Bureau of Civil
Aviation Security, Delhi, on carrying out investigation at the
wreckage subsequently has submitted that none of the typical
characteristics associated with the on-board explosion, such as
metal fractures, split fragments, fissuring, vaporisation on
fragment surfaces, pitting, erosion, flooring and curling was
observed. The examination of the human bodies also did not
reveal explosion related signatures. The left out and rear
cargo holds and retrieved baggages also did not give any traces
of explosion.
3.14 Pathological Report
The post mortem examination of dead bodies of the crew
members was conducted at civil hospital Sundar Nagar and in
respect of other dead bodies autopsy was waved off by the
66

order of the District Magistrate, Mandi. The examination of
the post mortem report of the crew members indicate that the
bodies of both the pilots had suffered impact and fire injuries
whereas that of the Flight Attendant, the whole of his body
was having second degree burn and impact injuries. As per
the opinion of the medical experts, the cause of death of all
the crew members was found to be due to multiple injuries
and burn respectively. In respect of the passengers, the cause
of death was opined to be impact and fire damage.
3.15 FIRE
The aircraft after disintegration on initial impact with trees
and thereafter collision with the hill top, had caught fire
mostly in wing portions. However, it had extinguished and its
own.

CHAPTER - III
4. ANALYSIS OF EVIDENCE TENDERED BEFORE THE
COURT OF INQUIRY
The evidence tendered before the Court of Inquiry for the
purpose of correct appreciation can be viewed from the angle of the
possibility of sabotage, airworthiness of the aircraft, submission of
flight plan and the operational route followed and the role of Pilot-
in-Command and Co-Pilot during the flight.
During the course of hearing, strenuous submissions have been
made not only by the Airports Authority of India mainly, but also by
other parties including the operator. Facts have been brought to the
notice of this Court vividly, at length in order to establish that the
direct and proximate cause of the accident in question was gross-
negligence of the crew members i.e. the Pilot-in-Command and the
Co-Pilot. The record shows that both the pilots were experienced in
flying in other aircraft(s) other than B-200 VT-EUJ. Both the pilots
got training in flying in the aircraft in question but both of them
lacked experience of flying on this type of aircraft in the
mountainous region. From the analysis of the available records, it
would be worthwhile to state that change of the aircraft as also that
of the Co-Pilot had been done not only without consulting the
organisational authorities but also without observing the codal
formalities exclusively by the Pilot-in-Command Capt. R.D.S.
Sandhu. Both the pilots appeared to have undertaken a maiden
flight in this aircraft and they did so even without prior landing or
knowing the nature of the terrain as also without consulting the map
68

or other documents pertaining thereto. The data produced before
this Court in the shape of evidence leads to such an inference. In
the instant case, none of the passengers and the crew members is
alive and this Court has to draw inferences on the basis of the oral
as also other documentary connected evidence produced before it.
In the previous part we have detailed all the factual
information regarding the ill-fated aircraft collected from various
sources through investigation. Now, under this part, our task would
be to analyse the material which has been 'brought on the record
from all the sources, namely, by collecting information through
investigating groups as well as the material produced before us by
various agencies in terms of affidavits, documentary evidence and the
oral evidence recorded by this Court. The overall critical analysis of
the entire material indicates that the following factual details are
either not in dispute or have been well-established:-
4.1(cid:9) Facts Admitted or Established
a) Beech Super King Air B-200 aircraft VT-EUJ belonged
to the Punjab Government. The aircraft was new and
had a valid Certificate of Registration granted on
15.3.1994.
b) The aircraft VT-EUJ was registered in passenger
category and the Punjab Government was the Operator
of the Aircraft.
69

c) The aircraft was airworthy as per certifications. The
maximum all-up-weight was 5669.90 kgs. i.e., below 5700
kgs.
d) As per Flight Plan filed with ATC, Chandigarh IAF, the
aircraft was to operate Chandigarh-Bhuntar-
Chandigarh-Ludhiana-Chandigarh. ETD Chandigarh on
the first leg was 0800 IST and ETA Bhuntar was 0820
IST.
e) The enroute weather as informed to the fateful aircraft
at 0846 IST by Archana Airways Aircraft, which was on
its flight from Kullu to Shimla, was, cumulous clouds
between Bilaspur and Sundar Nagar and Kullu Valley
clear.
f) The aircraft had no pending snag and had adequate fuel
for the flight.
The aircraft took off from Chandigarh at 0850 IST.
g)
Capt. R.D.S. Sandhu, Chief Pilot of Punjab
Government was the PIC and Capt. P.S. Nanar was the
Co-Pilot. Apart from the Flight Attendant, Shri
Pandey, there were 10 passengers, comprising the late
Governor of Punjab and Himachal Pradesh and 9
members of his family, including four children.
h) Chandigarh Tower cleared the aircraft to depart to
Bhuntar on flight level 90 via flight plan route.
70

i)(cid:9)
At 0853 IST, the aircraft reported overhead Chandigarh
at 7,000 feet and set course for Bhuntar. The estimated
timings, as given by PIC to Chandigarh Tower and to
Alpha Control, were abeam Bilaspur 0902 IST and
arrival Bhuntar 0910 IST.
(cid:9)
0
At 0856 IST, the aircraft reported 10 miles from
Chandigarh and being in contact with Alpha Control,
Barnala and changed over to Alpha Control.
k)(cid:9)
At 0901 IST, the aircraft reported checking abeam
Bilaspur and maintaining flight level 90.
The aircraft was in contact with Alpha Control till 0902
IST, when the PIC was told to call Alpha Control when
in contact with Bhuntar. This transmission was
acknowledged by the aircraft at 09:02:45 IST and this
was the last contact with the aircraft.
m) As per AIC 16/92,
Bhuntar airfield is fit for VFR
operations only, since it is surrounded by hills. Bhuntar
airfield is controlled by AM, while Chandigarh is an
IAF airfield.
n)
As per AIP India, for the sector Chandigarh - Bhuntar
of the ATS Route W-35, the upper/lower limits of flight
level are 460/150 and the minimum flight altitude is
12600 feet.
71

o) Bhuntar airfield did not receive at any time the flight
plan or ETA of the fateful flight from ATC Chandigarh
or through FIC Delhi, or from any other agency.
p) The site of crash is within the designated airspace VIR
150, which airspace as per AIP India RAC 5-22
constituted the local flying area of Chandigarh and the
corirolling authority being ATC Chandigarh.
q) At no stage of the flight, the aircraft notified any
real/anticipated emergency, nor did it report any sudden
deterioration in enroute weather.
r) The PIC had total flying experience of over 7,500 hrs.,
of which about 100 hrs. was on type B-200 as PIC.
Neither the PIC, nor the Co-Pilot had Instrument
Rating on Beech Super King Air B-200.
s) As per log books, the PIC had last flown to Bhuntar on
2.6.1992 in C-90. There is no known record of the Co-
Pilot having flown to Bhuntar.
t) The first information of the accident reached official
agencies at Sundar Nagar at about 1130 IST same day.
Due to absence of precise details of site and the hilly
terrain, the ground rescue team could reach the site
only by 1530 IST or so. There were no survivors.
u) Heliborne search for the aircraft was mounted by two
helicopters at 1205 hrs. and 1230 hrs. respectively, but
72

due to cloudy weather, hill tops could not be searched
and the wreckage was not sighted, but distress signals
were being received.
v) As per Order of the Punjab Government No.9/39/92-
4T(3)/17277, dated 10.10.1992, which were in force on
9.7.1994, relatives of the Governor were not authorised
to use the Government aircraft, except with the
permission of the Chief Minister of Punjab. As per
available evidence/records, including affidavits filed by
Officials of the Punjab Government, no such permission
had been granted in the present case.
w) The aircraft did not have a CVR or FDR fitted in it.
Nor did the aircraft have a Ground Proximity Warning
System (GPWS).
x) There is no evidence or suspicion that the accident has
been directly or indirectly caused by sabotage, internal
explosion or causes external to the crew and the
aircraft.
There being no survival in the instant accident, the Court has
an onerous task to determine the causes thereof. The absence
of CVR and DFDR, in fact, is a severe inhibiting factor in
determining the causes of the accident. Thus omissions of the
cockpit crew have to be ascertained from the realm of
possibilities and derivatives. It is not practicable to consider
each of these possibilities in great depth, since the ATC/Alpha
73

Control tape transcript and other derived data has been taken
into consideration to narrow down and pick out the reasons
contributing towards the accident.
Records show that flight was originally planned in C-90 and
even the flight movement was given to ATC by Shri Balwinder
Singh, PW-68. It was after about 22.00 hrs. 1ST on July 8,
1994, that the aircraft was changed to Super King Air B-200
and Co-Pilot Capt. Pargat Singh was substituted for Capt.
Vivek Mehra, who had no training and experience in flying on
the fateful aircraft. Learned counsels appearing on behalf of
the Airports Authority of India and Indian Air Force have
forcefully argued that though the flight plan reflects IFR
movement by the crew members of the aircraft in question, yet
they followed VFR (Visual Flight Rule). They have
repeatedly submitted that notwithstanding the aspect indicated
by the flight plan regarding the flight to be under IFR
conditions, the available indications are that the Pilot-in-
Command flew the aircraft in VFR conditions.
It is well settled and accepted principle that during a flight the
responsibility for terrain clearance is that of the Pilot-in-
Command. Rule 141 of the Aircraft Rules, 1937 clarifies this
fact. The Pilot-in-Command is not responsible for such terrain
clearance only when the aircraft is being vectored under radar
control, but his responsibility becomes more onerous when the
flight is being operated under VFR conditions. In the
subsequent paras, I would be dealing with this aspect
specifically. The initial question for viewing the causes of
accident arises firstly, as to whether the flight in question was
74

being operated upon under VFR conditions and secondly what
is the sanctity of the submission of the Flight Plan?
The available information reflected from the record shows
firstly that Capt. Sandhu, the Pilot-in-Command as also the
Co-Pilot did not have instrument rating in Super King Air B-
200. Secondly, the position reports given to Alpha Control by
the aircraft also show that the aircraft was being flown at flight
level 90 which is the level given in the flight plan too. I fully
agree with the submissions of the learned counsels appearing
on behalf of the parties that in case the aircraft was being
flown under IFR route conditions, the aircraft had to maintain
at least level 135. Thirdly, Bhuntar airfield is only fit for VFR
operations. Fourthly, that the flight in question was of a short
duration i.e. 20 minutes or so, and that too in the mountainous
region. Bhuntar airfield to the knowledge of one and all is an
aerodrome located in-between the valleys at a height of about
3,200 feet from the mean sea level. Thus, the flying
operations to the above said airfield involved flight under VFR
conditions only. Judicial notice can also be taken of the fact
that Rohtang Pass in this mountainous region is at a height of
13,500 feet from the sea level and its crow flight distance from
the Bhuntar airfield is only about one nautical mile. In other
words, the height of the top hill of the mountain in which
Rohtang Pass is located is about 15,000 feet and flying
operation in this area requires the aircraft to be flown at least
at a level of 170. In the circumstances appearing from the
record as also the topography of the mountainous region, it
appears unlikely that the Pilot-in-Command had contemplated
the first segment to be operated upon in IFR conditions and
75

the other segment i.e. the landing part in VFR conditions.
Fifthly, the Pilot-in-Command had come to know even before
taking off from Chandigarh that there were cumulous clouds
between Bilaspur and Sundar Nagar which required stricter
precautions to be taken by the Pilot-in-Command in flying a
high dignitary and his family to an aerodrome like Bhuntar in
almost bad weather. It has also come in evidence of PW-68
that after the submission of the flight plan, he had handed
over its one copy to the Pilot-in-Command with the request to
correct the entry with respect to the aircraft in question being
flown in VFR conditions which had wrongly been shown to be
under IFR conditions. According to this witness, he had also
requested him to submit a new flight plan with respect to the
use of the aircraft in question but the later did not do so. No
other evidence in rebuttal to this fact has been produced.
Thus, PW-68 has to be believed to this extent. However,
despite all these circumstances, the fact remains that the Flight
Despatcher as per his own admission and coupled with other
evidence, was not authorised by the DGCA to be an approved
Flight Despatcher, earlier also he used to submit the flight
plans. This unauthorised act has not in any way contributed
to this accident. In any case, for the purpose of inferring the
nature of the flight in question, whether it was under VFR
conditions or IFR conditions, the cumulative effect of the
above said circumstances, to my mind, do lead to an
irresistible conclusion that it was under VFR conditions.
Despite having come to this conclusion, I cannot help
observing that none of the technical persons like Capt.
Balwinder Singh, (PW-68) or Pilot-in-Command as also the
76

Co-Pilot or even the Indian Air Force ATC Controller, who
accepted the flight plan or the authorities of the Airport
Authority of India's Flight Information Centre understood the
sanctity of the flight plan. The wrong data in the flight plan
so submitted is needed to be identified and thus by
introducing a strict rule whereunder accountability attracting
disciplinary action should clearly be foisted against the
concerned defaulter(s). It is expected that DGCA would take
immediate corrective steps in this respect. It would be
desirable to point out that the underlying object of the filing
of the flight plan is to make the authorities like ATC, FIC, or
other officers connected therewith, aware with respect to its
correctness the nature of the route being followed by the
Pilot-in-Command so that case of distress message from the
pilot or otherwise, he may be helped/guided in a proper
manner by the controlling authorities. In otherwise case, it
would be in the discretion of the Pilot-in-Command to deviate
from the pre-determined route already indicated by him and
fly the aircraft to any place according to his whims which
would definitely endanger not only the safety of the crew
members, but also that of the passengers thereof. The
awareness of the pilots should also be drawn to the
importance of the submission of the flight plans and for this
purpose the Director General of Civil Aviation should also
issue relevant instructions.
77

4.2 Maintenance & Security Aspects as per Evidence
Having dealt with the nature of the flying conditions of the
aircraft in question, it would also be proper to deal with the
maintenance and security aspect of the aircraft in question.
From the available records, it appears that this particular
aircraft VT-EUJ was newly purchased and thereafter it was
not involved in any incident necessitating any major or minor
structural repair. Statements of PWs Balwinder Singh, Mrs.
A.C. Duggal, S.K. Kasle and J.S. Maini (PW-68, 67, 70 and 89
respectively) besides others, would show that there were no
mal-functioning or deficiencies in functioning of the aircraft
because of the sudden development or maintenance lapses.
From the analysis of the sworn testimony of PWs-67, 73 and
89, it is apparent that the overall incharge of the maintenance
was Chief Engineer Shri Lakhbir Singh. The aircraft in
question had been purchased only about three months before
the accident i.e. in March, 1995. The old practice continued
even in respect of this aircraft. However, as Shri Lakhbir
Singh, PW-73, was not fully conversant with the technical
equipments of the newly purchased Super King B-200, the
maintenance of the said aircraft had been entrusted to M/s
Indamer Company, who had deputed Shri M.P. Chako, PW-91
for this purpose. In other words, M/s Indamer Company, the
agent of M/s Beechcraft had been substituted to regularly
maintain the aircraft in question for its use by its operator, the
Punjab Government, and none of the persons in the civil
organisation of the operator had been made responsible for
any lapse of the so-called Incharge of the maintenance wing or
any other person under any specific rules. This system had
78

been continuing with the Punjab Government vis-a-vis the
earlier aircraft like C-90 also. This organisational vacuum on
the part of the operator needs to be corrected by the
regulatory authority i.e. DGCA. It is expected that regulatory
authority shall take all possible steps to improve the working
in this behalf by issuing requisite instructions. From the
available record, it appears that the operators appeared to
have been working as per practice and not in conformity with
the rules which also did not come to the notice of the
regulatory authority as well. The said factors do not seem to
have been the direct or proximate cause of the accident in
question, yet strict vigilance by the regulatory authority is
required to be kept in future.
At this stage, we deem it fit to scrutinised the conduct of PW-
91, the overall incharge of the aircraft in question. Shri Chako
(PW-91) is an engineer in the private company styled as Ms/
Indamer Company, Bombay, but he also seems to have given
a varied version as to the maintenance job of the aircraft
undertaken by him. No doubt, he appears to be perfect in his
technical knowhow yet he has failed to understand the basic
object attached to his duties. As already pointed out, original
flight was planned in C-90 regarding which flight movement
had also been submitted. Regarding the aircraft in question,
which was substituted for C-90 at the last moment by the
Pilot-in-Command, PW-91, namely, Shri Chako has stated that
he had been told by the Pilot-in-Command to keep the said
aircraft in proper shape at 1530 hours IST on 8.7.1994. He
also states that he had been apprised with respect to the
purpose for which aircraft in question was required on the
79

following morning. This part of the testimony of the PW-91
is not very confidence-inspiring in as much as he had no
satisfactory explanation as to why he preponed the flight
release check to 7.7.1994. He claims that on July 8, 1994,
some time after being told by the Pilot-in-Command that B-
200 aircraft will be required the next morning, he went to the
hangar and carried the Daily Inspection, but did not endorse
in the records to such effect. Record on the contrary show the
inspection of the aircraft in question by him having been so
conducted on 9.7.1994. The endorsement on the certificate to
this effect also cements this fact. However, on an overall
analysis of his evidence coupled with statements of PWs-69
and 70, the preponderance of probability is that Shri Chako on
being merely told by the Pilot-in-Command on 8.7.1994 of the
possibility of requiring B-200 aircraft the next morning, went
to the hangar and endorsed the record on 8.7.1994, as if he
had carried out the necessary check and put the date as
9.7.1994. Earlier flight release check of the aircraft in
question was conducted on 25.6.1994. This witness has also
admitted that originally he had planned to leave Chandigarh
on 8.7.1994. He as per his own admission was residing in one
of the sets of Punjab Bhavan, Chandigarh. Though he claims
to have left Chandigarh on 9.7.1994, yet the attenuating
circumstances when read together, lead to the inference that
this witness had left Chandigarh to Delhi as planned on
8.7.1994. Be that as it may, S/Shri J.S. Maini and Capt. Vivek
Mehra have categorically stated that aircraft of the type C-90
was requisitioned for the flight in question and that Capt.
Vivek Mehra was directed to be available as a Co-Pilot on
9.7.1994. This direction as per his statement had been given
80

to him on 8.7.1994 after 15.30 hours IST when there had been
a meeting of the Pilot-in-Command with Shri J.S. Maini, PW-
89. It is worth-noting that Mrs. A.C. ,Duggal, PW-67 was on
leave in the second week of July, 1994. According to the
sworn testimony of the witnesses, the change with respect to
the aircraft as also that of the Co-Pilot was affected at about
2200 hours IST on 8.7.1994 by the Pilot-in-Command himself
without taking into confidence other persons connected
therewith. If that be so, how and under what circumstances
Shri Chako, PW-91 could be informed of the change of the
aircraft or he could be directed to keep the aircraft Super
King B-200 to be in proper order for its use by the Operator
or any other person earlier to 2200 hours IST as deposed by
him. In the circumstances, it is safe and reasonable to
presume that Shri Chako did leave Chandigarh on 8.7.1994
itself and his statement to the contrary to this extent is
inherently improbable. Be that as it may, there is little doubt
that the PIC either on his own, or at the instance of perhaps,
the Honourable Governor, decided to operate B-200 Aircraft
instead of the C-90 aircraft in view of the load factor. Such
change of the aircraft is significant to the extent that the
passenger load of 10 persons was apparently known to the PIC
the previous night itself, whether or not he shared this
information with Shri Maini (PW-89). No iota of evidence
with respect to the mal-functioning of the aircraft in question
or deficiencies in its functioning had been brought to my
notice. On the contrary, the flight release check does indicate
that inspections used to be carried out periodically. The
conduct of Shri Chako, PW-91 though has not contributed in
any manner towards the accident in question is yet deplorable.
81

Whosoever appears before a Court of Law, is expected to tell
the truth and bring the true facts to the notice of the Court
with the object of assisting it to infer correct conclusions. I
need not dwell upon this aspect of the statement any further,
because it would not in any way help me in inferring the cause
of the accident.
The next question which arises for consideration as to why the
Pilot-in-Command had deviated from the visual flight route?
There appears to be no straight forward answer to this query
except the one that either he was over-confidence of his flying
experience or he did not know the terrain or he never
consulted the Jeppesen map in order to know the location of
the Bhuntar airport or the dangerous mountains located
nearby the aerodrome or its location. The record shows that
more than two years back in June, 1992, the Pilot-in-
Command Capt. R.D.S. Sandhu did fly as a Co-Pilot (P2) to
Bhuntar aerodrome and that too once. It also indicate that
neither he nor his Co-Pilot Capt. Pargat Singh had any
instrument rating on B-200 aircraft. It is also clear that Co-
Pilot never had trial landing to Bhuntar aerodrome either as
Pilot-in-Command or a Co-Pilot on any type of aircraft. In
the circumstances, why Pilot-in-Command chose Capt. Pargat
Singh to be Co-Pilot is answered by the fact that only he had
been trained to fly the aircraft in question and none else. I
would be dealing with the functions of the Co-Pilots separately
in subsequent paras. However, even for the purpose of the
query in question suffice it to say that all the circumstances
taken together lead me to infer that even Pilot-in-Command
Capt. R.D.S. Sandhu was not aware of the terrain topography
82

surrounding Bhuntar airfield to which he had proceeded. He
became a victim of over-confidence coupled with mental
pressure to complete the flight and to meet the subsequent
flight commitments. The other reason for the crash appears
to be his gross-negligence in as much as despite he having
been made aware of the cumulous clouds existing between
Bilaspur and Sundar Nagar, he continued his flight. The
moment he saw the clouds in thick layers interfering with his
visibility to proceed further, he should have negotiated the
aircraft from a distance before entering into it. The sabotage
aspect, I would be dealing at length separately, yet at this stage
I may remark that the attempt of Pilot-in-Command in having
pulled up the aircraft in question to a certain degree rules out
such possibility. Also the Pilot-in-Command cannot be labled
to be a terrorist in as much as per the reports submitted by
the Government of Punjab, both the pilots hailed from
respectable families and they were reported to have no
connection with terrorist activities in any manner. I need not
dilate upon the other part of the oral or documentary
evidence.
The fundamental purpose of the court of Inquiry is to
determine the probable cause of an aircraft accident, so that
appropriate steps may be taken up to prevent recurrence of
similar accidents. The nature of the enquiry into an aircraft
accident is not accusatory and its object is to take remedial
rather than punitive action. In this connection, a reference
may also be made to Rule 75(6) of the Aircraft Rules, 1937
(hereinafter referred to as 'the Rules') framed under the
83

Aircraft Act, 1934 (hereinafter called 'the Act). Sub-Rule (6)
of Rule 75 reads as under :-
"75(6) The Court shall make a report to the Central
Government stating its findings as to the causes of the
accident and the circumstances thereof and adding any
observations and recommendations which the court
thinks fit to make with a view to the preservation of life
and avoidance of similar accidents, in future, including
a recommendation for the cancellation, suspension or
endorsement of any licence or certificate issued under
these rules."
Keeping in view this paramount consideration, now, we wish
to analyse the evidence and material which have been brought on the
record from various sources through the assistance of various
agencies and their Counsel.
Our attention was also drawn by the learned Counsel
appearing for NAA (hereinafter called NAA). Mr. N.A.K. Sharma
to the following paragraph from ICAO Annex.-13, para 53 the
Manual of Aircraft Accident Investigation (DOC No.6920/AN/855)
in Chapter-I under heading 'Purpose of Enquiry':
'The basic cause of an accident and the remedial action
necessary to ensure that it will not recur, does not
always emerge from the physical facts of the case. For
example, a failure of some mechanical part may be due
to a failure to inspect or faulty inspection technique in
a factory or a maintenance shop where the defective
84

part should have been detected thereby preventing its
failure in service. Similarly, if human error appears as
a possible cause of the accident all factors which may
have influenced the actions should be examined. The
inquiry should not cease, if or when it is established an
error has been made: the inquiry should endeavour to
establish why the error occurred. Poor design
indifferent human engineering, inadequate or improper
operational procedures could well have confused or
misled the person. Experience has' shown that the
majority of aircraft accidents have been caused or
compounded by human error, often by circumstances
which were conducive to human error; this applies to
design, manufacture, testing, maintenance, inspection
and operational procedures both ground and air.
Identification of this element is frequently difficult but
it may be revealed by careful, skilful and persistent
investigative methods.
Some aircraft accidents have resulted from
organisational defects or weaknesses in management;
for example, an operator may have prescribed or
condoned procedures not commensurate with safe
operating conditions in practice. Similarly, ambiguous
instructions, and those capable of duel interpretation
may also have existed; these factors may well have
stemmed in the first instance from uncritical scrutiny by
regulating authorities. It may, therefore, be necessary
to inquire closely into other organisations or agencies
not immediately or directly concerned with the
85

circumstances of the accident but where action, or lack
of it, may have permitted or even caused the accident
to happen.
Where the cause of an accident is obscure, it may be
necessary to pursue as many hypotheses as could
seriously be regarded as possibilities and each pursued
to the limits of its usefulness, or to the limit where it
can be excluded as a possibility. This approach will
often result in some degree of speculation and
prolonged exploration but it may be the only course
open to the investigator. By carefully considering each
possibility in the light of the evidence adduced, and the
existing state of aeronautical knowledge, a number of
hypotheses will be eliminated; the credibility of those
which survive the process is thereby increased and
experience has shown that these will generally relate to
one particular area or group of possibilities.
Findings which have been arrived at by more than one
line of inquiry, by more than one person each reasoning
independently, are more likely to be correct than those
conclusions arrived at by pursuing one narrow field of
activity."
Keeping in view the aforesaid guiding principle, we need to
view the inquiry broadly from three angles, i.e. :
i)(cid:9) Was there a sabotage by explosive or otherwise?
86

ii)(cid:9) Was it a structural failure, i.e. mechanical failure; and
iii) Was it on account of human failure and if the answer is 'yes',
then what contributed to human failure?
4.3 Was There a Sabotage by Explosives or Otherwise?
This possibility has to be completely ruled out. There is no
material whatsoever to suggest a sabotage by explosive or
otherwise. It is no one's case either Pursuant to DGCA's
order dated July 13, 1994, Major T.V. Narayanan, Deputy
Commissioner of Security, Bomb Detection and Disposal
Squad, Bureau of Civil Aviation Security, New Delhi,
inspected the accidented plane and the site. According to his
report which is legally admissible, the crash of the aircraft in
question due to an explosive device is a remote possibility. To
identify the explosives from the wreckage, he used explosive
detection chemical kits and the tests so carried did not reveal
the presence of any explosives therein. The examination of
secondary metallic fragments did not reveal any diagnostic
signatures of explosion such as spiked tooth edge, surface
deposit, gas washing, reversed slant fracture, wire and rod
fragment, spall, curved fragment or fissure, fragment cupping
nor examination of wreckage and scanning of crash scene
could indicate any primary fragments of the bomb such as part
of detonators, detonator wire explosive, batteries, micro
switches, remote controls receivers or any other substance
which can be identified as having been as used for preparation
and activation of an explosive device. As per him, normally an
87

explosion in the mid-air causes the wreckage being blown off
at vast area along the flight path. However, the dispersement
pattern of wreckage revealed that almost every part of debris
were scattered within a funnel from the point of initial impact.
_ No wreckage behind the area of initial point of impact was
observed. None of the characteristics associated with on-board
explosion were observed by this witness who is an expert and
holds a responsible post. There is nothing to disbelieve the
testimony of this witness. Dr. J.R. Gaur, Assistant Director,
Himachal Pradesh Police Forensic expert had also carried out
examination of the wreckage for explosion aspects prior to the
visit of crash site by the Inspector of Accidents. His findings
are also to the same effect. Also other persons who witnessed
the occurrence state that the general weather conditions in the
valley were bad and hills were covered with low clouds. They
categorically state that there was thick fog and visibility was
almost nil. None of the eye witnesses heard any loud noise of
explosion nor saw any fire before the aircraft had crashed.
The fire observed at the site was limited to a certain area and
not very intense. Also the surrounding area below the initial
impact of aircraft with the trees and leaves of the trees as also
bushes were found blackened due to spillage of fuel. Besides
lighter and fragile wreckage were found scattered in the
immediate vicinity along the flight path direction. Besides, the
report of the Inspector of Accidents Exhibit PW 66/A reveal
that the examination of angle of slope of the stems of chopped
off trees and the throttle position show that the pilot made an
effort to climb probably when he realised that the trees and
hill were within close vicinity. This fact is substantiated by the
fact that during the wreckage examination, the pilots altimeter
88

reading was found to be 9400 feet. As the baro setting was
disturbed, Shri V.K. Chandna, PW-66 also carried out
experiment at the crash site by using a serviceable altimeter to
estimate the value of baro setting. This exercise was also
conducted on the simulator of the aircraft in question at Flight
Safety Foundation, Witchita, U.S.A., where too it was
observed that for 9400 feet, a baro setting of 1005 HPA
(Hectopascal) was required. With 1000 HPA setting, the
reading came to 9,260 feet and with 1013.25, the altimeter
gave reading at 9,610 feet, keeping in view the information
given to the pilot as 1,000 HPA in view of the QNH value of
CHD on the date of accident and thereof Kulu airport QNH
value was 1006 HPA at 0800 1ST.(cid:9) Also as per the
measurement of angle, exercise at which the aircraft had cut
the trees, carried out by the officials of the Forest Department
under the supervision of Shri Chander Shekhar Singh,
Divisional Forest Officer, PW-10, it was estimated that the 12
trees had been cut at 40 degrees pitch up attitude. This fact
also showed the aircraft was at a climbing altitude of about 40
degree at the time of impact with the trees before it hit the
hillock. Besides, no abnormality was observed either in the
altimeter showing 9400 feet as also Radio Altimeter showing
35 feet. The stick was found to have been pulled backward
with full force which shows that pilots had made an attempt to
gain instantaneous vertical speed. The entire material
emerging from the testimony of the various witness does not
give any indication of explosive device to be the proximate or
direct cause of the accident in question.
89

Sabotage
Last but not the least the next question that arises for
determination is "whether any circumstance emerging from the
evidence tend towards sabotage politically motivated or
otherwise?"
The public sector usually take note of the misleading publicity
through newspaper media. Conflicting views so expressed
through advertising media pertaining to the accidents in
question has impelled us to inquire this aspect elaborately. At
the very outset, it may be stated that there is no iota of
evidence on record to indicate any politically motivated
conspiracy nor there appears to be any family feud as to be
the cause of accident. No doubt Shri Ranjit Malhotra, one of
the sons of late Shri Surendra Nath, is married to a Muslim
lady which act caused differences in between the father and
the son. Also Late Shri Surinder Nath took certain drastic
steps to maintain law and order not only in Kashmir but also
in Punjab but these facts ipso facto in the absence of any
cogent and convincing evidence, are not sufficient to conclude
the possibility of sabotage. Both pilots, as per record, possess
commendable antecedents. Both hail from respectable Sikh
families of Patiala. Both were highly qualified and had
worked for long in the aviation establishments at different
places in this country. Their annual confidential record do not
reflect any stigma on the honesty, integrity or efficiency of
either during the tenure of their long service nor they are
stated to be the members of any terrorist gang or either of
them or any of their family members are found to have any
90

connection with such group. Merely that both belong to Sikh
community does not lead us to draw any such inferences. We
have already observed above that suspicion, howsoever, strong
cannot take the place of proof. Even otherwise various
circumstances like the cutting of trees on initial impact of the
aircraft in question, the attempt to uplift the plane at the
delayed moment and the absence of distress message during
the communication exchanged between the crew members
(pilots) and ATC Chandigarh or 'Alpha Control' Barnala
corroborates our conclusion regarding.the absence of sabotage
as the basis of the accident. The factum of the pilots flying
the aircraft at Flight Level 90 feet on IFR on a whisky 35
route contrary to the Circular No.16 of 1992 referred to above,
merely shows that either of the pilots were neither acquainted
with the terrain nor the altitude of hills located there in VFR
route nor either of them had consulted the concerned map.
This fact is also indicated by the fact that the pilot had
deviated from the actual VFR route. Thus from whatsoever
angle we may view this aspect, the omissions and commissions
on the part of the pilots merely tend to show their gross
negligence in which the aircraft was being piloted by them.
4.4 Was it a Structural Failure i.e. Mechanical Failure?
The another possibility is the possibility of failure i.e. sudden
appearance of mechanical defect in the aircraft in question at
the material time or prior thereto. Admittedly the aircraft in
question was purchased in March, 1994, i.e. about three
months prior to the accident from M/s Beechcraft, U.S.A. It
91

was a new and it was being maintained by their duly
authorised agent in India. The aircraft in question had been
maintained and inspected in accordance with approved
maintenance schedule and the same was certified to be safe
for flight during the currency of the certificate. It is to be,
noted from the certificate of flight release that earlier flight
release check was conducted on 25.6.1994 and ARME
inspection was valid upto 24.7.1994. The aforesaid certificate
was also valid till 9.7.1994 or upon completion by the aircraft
of 25 flying hours from the date of its issuance i.e. 25.6.1994.
I have already discussed above that pre-flight inspection had
been conducted on 8.7.1994 though shown to have been
endorsed on 9.7.1994 at 0700 hours IST. In his cross-
examination, PW-91, has categorically stated that even flight
release check is current and the aircraft is not due for the next
flight check. If aircraft is planned for a sortie, pre-flight check
up is required to be done. No approval from the witness used
to be required by the Punjab Government for the use of the
aircraft in question or to plan a sortie. He has categorically
stated that no complaint with respect to snag had been made
to him by the Pilot-in-Command. Rather on the other hand
he had been continuing the flight release check or pre-flight
release check in due course. We have also not found any
evidence to infer that there appeared to be any structural
defect/mechanical failure. Shri Chako, PW-91 is believable to
this extent only that the aircraft in question was thoroughly
checked by him and duly maintained for the purpose of its use
in flights by the operator. The details with respect to parts
already noted earlier indicates that the aircraft in question was
technically superb and thus airworthy at the relevant time.
92

Normally, it is expected of a pilot before he takes over the
command, to go for a pre-flight briefing and thereafter when
he sits in the seat of the Pilot-in-Command to check all the
parameters and any grave mistake if comes to his notice, he is
required to report the same to the engineers ,before taking off
from the aerodrome. PW-91 has categorically stated that
there was no snag in the aircraft nor he received any
complaint. Over and above, even the tape transcript does not
show of any distress message or complaint with respect to
sudden appearance of mechanical defect in any part of the
machinery of the aircraft in question. All these factors show
that upto the time of impact with the trees at the crash site,
there was no mal-functioning or any defect found in the
aircraft. From the survey of these datas the possibility of
structural failure is completely ruled out.
4.5 Was it on Account of Human Failure and if Answer is 'YES',
What Contributed to the Human Failure?
Having briefly dealt with the structural or mechanical failure
as also explosive and sabotage aspects, we, now, switch over to
the next most important and crucial aspect of human failure.
From the material available on the record, it is apparent that
this is a clear cut case of error of judgment on the part of the
cockpit crew members. In this connection, it may be useful to
refer to the flight plan in the first instance. A perusal of the
flight plan and the ATC tape, i.e. conversation record at the
Air Traffic Control Tower, Chandigarh under Air Force
Authorities and as reproduced in the preceding part it is clear
93

that the aircraft manned by both the flight crew was going on
the scheduled path upto the boundary of Bilaspur, but 'the
moment it entered Sundar Nagar area, it appeared to have
moved off the track (pre-determined flight path). As already
pointed out Chandigarh-Bhuntar flight being whisky 35 route,
the flight to Bhuntar Aerodrome was fit for VFR operations
only as per Aeronautical Information Circular 16 of 1992.
Both pilots were sufficiently experienced persons in flying. It
is, thus, prima facie to be presumed that the nature of route
and VFR operational flight was within their knowledge. Also
as per Pilot's log book, Capt. R.D.S. Sandhu, the Pilot-in-
Command alone, had last flown to Kullu on King Air C-90 as
P2 on 2.6.1992 whereas as per the Flying Log Book of capt.
Pargat Singh, he had not flown to Kullu till the date of
accident. In fact, it was their maiden flight in the aircraft in
question. The record also reveal that initially on 8th July,
1994, King Air C-90 was requisitioned for the flight in
question and Capt. Mehra was asked to remain available as
Co-Pilot. This fact finds support from the flight plan filed
with Chandigarh ATC by Shri Balwindar Singh PW68 who also
in his testimony deposed the same fact. Apart from this
witness, S/Sh. J.S. Maini, PW 89 and Capt. Vinod Mehta, PW
89 also state to the same effect. Sh. Maini, PW 89 has
categorically stated that the (Pilot-in-Command), PIC, was the
incharge of the operational cell and he had nothing to do with
it. He also shows his ignorance as to how and under what
circumstances the aircraft was changed. Rather according to
him, he had permitted the Chief Pilot to take C-90 aircraft
only. As regards, the number of persons who were to
accompany Late Sh. Surendra Nath, he stated that discussion
94

with PIC confined only about the tour of the aforesaid
dignitary as a sole passenger. How other persons/members
boarded the plane, is only known to him (PIC since diseased).
Apart from it, none of the crew members had I.F. Rating in
this aircraft. Both the Commanders were in possession of
information regarding enroute weather conditions even before
take off clearance given by Chandigarh ATC. In addition,
Capt. V. Mehta of Archana Airways, who was operating flight
from Kullu to Shimla, states that shortly before landing at
Shimla, he got an RT call from VUJ on Chandigarh approach
frequency 122.7 MHz requesting Kullu, whereto he informed
that Kullu valley was though clear but the enroute weather was
partly cloudy and easily negotiable. As per him, the clouds
were mostly broken 2 to 3 octas strat-us and strato-cumulus
except between Bilaspur and Sundar Nagar; also that there
were continuous layered clouding covering the hill tops and
that at level 80 (on QNH), he had to deviate about 5 NM
right of track to stay above the clouds, between Sundar Nagar
and Bilaspur. The Chandigarh ATC tape transcript also offers
the same fact about weather conditions.
Besides the record tends to show that there was an
organisational vacuum in the upper echelons of the Punjab
Government, so far as operational control and supervision of
aircraft in question was concerned. Though organisational
vacuum cannot at all be blamed to have in any way
contributed towards this accident yet in this inquiry we also
feel it our bounden duty to expose the extent of irregularities
of the operator in this regard. The Punjab Government was
an operator of the passenger category. It was, thus, the
95

statutory duty of the Punjab Government to evolve means by
which the statutory responsibilities of an operator could be
complied with. While Director Civil Aviation, Punjab (PW 67)
repeatedly stated that the operational flights of the aircraft
were controlled by the Secretary (PW89) and he used to give
directions to the Chief Pilot directly. The Secretary (PW89)
not only stated that the overall control of the Civil Aviation
Department of Punjab rested with its Director (PW67), but
also that PW67 was responsible to ensure that DGCA's
instructions are complied with in letter and spirit. Even as
regards, maintenance - PW89 - says that the Chief Engineer
(PW73) stationed at Patiala with respect to C-90 was overall
incharge of this section. However, the record reflects that with
respect to the aircraft in question, Punjab Government had no
engineer, qualified and approved for carrying out maintenance
and resultantly this task was entrusted to M/s Indamer Co., but
pathetically there was no supervisory authority. This Chief
Pilot (PIC) late Capt. R.D.S. Sandhu, for all intents and
purposes, was the Incharge of operational flight control. In
other words the Civil Aviation Department of the Punjab
Government was a divided house with respect to operational
control and supervision of aircraft in question. May that as it
be, a duty has also been cast on the pilots. Rule 141 of the
Rules lays down, the duties of the Pilot-in-Command which
lays down a very onerous duty on him. It reads as under :-
"141.Duties of Pilot-in-Command
1.(cid:9) Subject to the provisions of Clause (b) of Sub-
Rule (2) of Rule 140-B, the operator shall
96

designate for each flight, one pilot as Pilot-in-
Command, who shall supervise and direct the
other members of the crew in the proper
discharge of their duties in the flight operations.
2. In addition to being responsible for the operation
and safety fo the aircraft during flight for the
safety of the passengers and cargo carried out
and for the maintenance of flight discipline and
safety of the members of the crew.
3. The Pilot-in-Command shall have final authority
as to the disposition of the aircraft while he is in
command.
Sub-Rule (3) above - this gives a last word to the PIC. It is he
who is the final authority so far as the command of the flight
is concerned.
Aircraft in question was a registered passenger aircraft.
Regarding its use, a Circular dated 10.10.1992 had also been
issued by the Punjab Government which listed seriatum-wise
eight category of dignitaries who could requisition the aircraft
(s) for their use protocol-wise.
Now, as per evidence, the aircraft in question was
requisitioned not only for the use of late Shri Surendra Nath,
but also for taking the Chief Minister of Punjab from
Chandigarh to Ludhiana and back immediately after leaving
the then Governor at Kullu. Thus as per flight plan, the
97

aircraft in question was to take off from Chandigarh
aerodrome initially at 0800 hrs. IST and then after its return
from Kullu, it was to go on its flight to Ludhiana at 0830
hours IST. Thus, time factor pressure occasioned by the tight
schedule also appears to have contribut'd indirectly in causing
this accident. In addition from the conduct of the PIC, it
appears that he was a docile and a pliable person, who always
adapted himself to the needs of his political bosses, may be for
selfish ends, and thereby he had become their blue-eyed boy.
In other words, Pilot-in-Command had political protection for
all of his actions and that may be one of the reasons for his
habit having so been inculcated to take independent but poor,
faulty and risky decisions mismatching in task-time
relationship. As all the above-said facts have bearing on
analysing the human failure as one of its major cause, we have
considered it better to narrate the same at this stage. Thus, it
is in the above said background that we now proceed to
analyse the crucial aspect of human failure.
The above said discussion leads to the question as to what is
really understood by the expression "human error". How many
types of such errors are there and in what way they contribute
in causing accidents. The analytical scrutiny of this expression
from various books and opinions of the various aviation
experts reflected through their articles, indicate that the
human errors are of three kinds :
1. Deliberate errors;
2. Skill errors; and
3. Inadvertent errors.
98

These errors encompass conscious intellectual decisions to
carry out imprudent acts such as a flight into known severe weather,
landing in weather conditions below minima etc. Aggressive nature
and risk taking habit also contribute to such errors. The way in
which pilot thinks enroute flying. Such errors generally result from
poor decision making.
Skill errors are due to lack of knowledge, inadequate training,
lack of experience etc. Such accidents generally occur during initial
training or when a pilot switching over from one type of aircraft to
another.
Inadvertent errors are like mistakes and errors of judgment.
They usually occur due to various reasons like intention of
commander not clear to other crew members, faulty communication,
mis-match in task-time relationship, poor man - machine interaction,
external environmental factors etc.
Thus critically scanning the material which has come to the
notice of this Court during evidence, the inescapable conclusion
which can be inferred is that PIC late Capt. R.D.S. Sandhu
committed the following acts of omissions and commissions which
considered cumulatively formed the basis of the accident in
question:-
Firstly, as per the evidence he suomoto not only changed the
aircraft from C-90 to B-200 without taking into confidence any
other responsible person much less the Secretary Civil
Aviation, but also associated Capt. Pargat Singh as a Co-pilot
on the maiden flight by changing a new type of aircraft on
99

whisky 35 route to Bhuntar aerodrome even without trial
landing contrary to para 6.4 of Civil Aviation Requirements
(CAR) Section 2 (Airworthiness) Series '0', Part I, Issue IV
dated 24th April, 1992 which being of mandatory nature,
requires that the first pilot (PIC) shall have made at least two
flights either as first pilot without passengers or as second
Pilot along the route over which he is required to fly on
conditions permitting visual contact flying. It appears that in
this case, PIC was not aware of this safety requirement or he
conveniently brushed aside all the statutory norms even. The
material emerging from record reveals that he had undertaken
a flight to Bhuntar in C-90 on 9.6.1992 and none thereafter.
This mandatory safety requirement has been violated. It
further appears that the change of aircraft was necessitated
because of the increase of number of passengers. Obviously
C-90 had lessor seating capacity with belts than B-200. This
decision also seem to have been taken by him independently
may be in consultation with his political bosses.
Secondly, that PIC allowed four extra passengers contrary to
the maximum seating capacity of the configuration of VT-EUJ
which is nine in toto i.e. seven passengers and two crew
members. The seating configuration in this aircraft considered
of one piece couch with one belt, one aft facing seat with belt,
four seats with belts in club formation and side facing seat
with belt, in addition to pilots and co-pilots seats. The couch
had space to seat more than one person, but seat belt is only
provided for one person. As per the oral testimony as also the
report of PW66 (Shri V.K. Chandna) though baggage area had
provision for installing two folding seats with belts, yet these
100

additional seats had not been installed and baggage area was
used for baggage only.(cid:9)
The number of persons
accommodated in the plane totalled 13 (thirteen).
Admittedly,
late Shri Surendra Nath was accompanied by his nine family
members. Nate;(cid:9) in view of the seating cue,. • ton all of
them appear to have been accommodated in(cid:9)

of the then Governor, but the said ar ,n;
ated not
only the underlying object of Rule 141(cid:9)
red J above, but
it also endangered life and safety of persons on board as also
their property including the aircraft.
Thirdly, that the PIC neither himself filed the flight plan nor
effected corrections therein. Even flight was originally
planned in C-90 regarding which the flight movement was
101

given to ATC Chandigarh by Shri Balwindar Singh, PW68 who
claimed himself to be a flight despatcher, but did not have the
authorisation or approval of DGCA in this regard. Simply the
fact that he had Commercial Pilot's Licence did not alter the
situation. His evidence shows that earlier too, he used to file
the flight plan with ATC Chandigarh. This defalcation does
not seem to have come to the notice of anyone i.e. Director
Civil Aviation (PW67), the Secretary (PW89) both of Punjab
Government, Air Traffic Control, Chandigarh, Flight
Information Centre or even DGCA. This may be an
irregularity in exercising the supervisory authority on the
functioning of the operators and supervisory authority but it
cannot be said to be the proximate or even remote cause of
accident. However, it does reflect upon the conduct of Pilot-
in-Command in as much as that he used to take the things
lightly in routine manner without caring for the consequences
thereof. In any case, this fact does tend to show that he was
habituated to discharge his prime duties negligently. This
conclusions is further substantiated from the fact that wrong
description has been given in the flight plan as in the instant
case PW68 (unauthorised Flight Despatcher) indicated the
flight to be under IFR conditions contrary to AIP India
Circular No.16 of 1992 whereunder flight to Bhuntar airfield
could only be under VFR conditions. Also the level was
shown to be 90 whereas it being a Whisky 35 route, the
minimum level as required should have been 12,600 feet as
laid down by AIP India for IFR flights on the sector
Chandigarh-Bhuntar. The wrong information provided to
ATC through Flight Plan shows that neither PIC nor Co-Pilot
or even PW68 understood the sanctity thereof.
102

Fourthly, there was neither any arrangements for check-in of
passengers nor that of pre-embarkation security check. As per
the evidence, the luggage was loaded simultaneously with the
checking-in of the passengers, who had arrived at the airport
just about five minutes before it took off from Chandigarh
Aerodrome. Had there been such arrangement, it might not
have allowed such number of persons to accompany the high
dignitary. In this regard, it is desirable that DGCA should
take corrective measures directing the private operators to
make requisite arrangements for check-in of passengers and
pre-embarkation of security check.
5. OTHER ASSOCIATED ASPECTS OF AIR SAFETY
MEASURES
5.1 Whether cultural differences come into play in air
disasters in the stage of maddening tensions?
Culture difference does play a significant role in air disasters.
There is no gain-saying the fact that excellence in any
organisation does not depend upon machines, material and
building alone. It also depends upon the quality of personnel
who are associated with them. All these years, the emphasis
has been to improve technology in the air traffic,
communication, navigation and safety services in the
organisation of Civil Aviation. Yet the experience reveals that
controlling air traffic in the skies is a serious business for
which a high standard of professional competence is a pre-
requisite. Professional expertise demands on-going
103

appreciation of new technology, values, concepts, laws,
organisational forms and many other influences including
culture.
The answer to this question is in the positive. According to
the study by the aviation experts, scientists and anthropologists
as also recently undertaken by Boeing Commercial Group on
the basis of the rate of accidents per million take-offs, which
of course, needs in-depth and detailed analysis, countries with
high rate of individualism have low accident rates, while
countries where people in lower position tend to depend more
on superiors, have higher accident rates. Various
circumstances emerging from the above noted facts, give rise
to a very important question as to "what is the role of culture
in air mishaps?" According to aviation experts, if Rules and
norms governing aviation are not broken, there would "almost
be no accidents". Most of the accidents take place while (i)
Taking-off; (ii) Landing; and (iii) In mountainous terrain.
All these accidents take place not because of mal-functioning
of the machinery or equipment, but also because of the pilots
error. Here the importance of Co-Pilot has to be realised. If
he is technically sound, knowledgeable, alert and provides his
support, the chances of accidents will be considerably reduced.
But, if the commander has no faith or confidence in the Co-
Pilot or if two are not friendly, the mishap is bound to occur.
It appears that in recent accidents in India, two main
functionaries in the cockpit have mostly failed to work as a
team. Survey by the experts pointed out that 73.7 per cent
104

accidents are related to the flight crew. In this view of the
matter, the aviation authorities world over particularly in
India, must undertake effective measures for errors and
commissions on part of the commanders to reduce, for the
safety of the passengers.
Apart from the "thin chain" leading to the part of the
commander and also that of the management, there are many
other contributory factors such as ill-equipped airports,
inadequate navigational aids, inefficient weather reports,
cumbersome crew procedures, indifferent maintenance,
defective designs and lack of proper investigation. Thus,
instead of analysing reasons for accident, there appears to be
an urgent need to formulate more strict rules for adherence by
the aviation officials concerned whether technical or non
technical. In addition, according to my opinion, the need for
revamping the air safety measures are never more urgent than
today. One can ignore the outburst of a casual accident, but
not the continuing and its frequent happenings. The increase
in the rate of airline crashes has come about for various
reasons to world which promote attention for improvement of
discipline and air safety measures does not seem to have been
given. Amongst others the age of the fleet, the quality of
maintenance, decline in management standards and highly
unionised staff which has been dictating terms to the
management, have also played their role in contributing their
share in airline crashes. Thus, the policy of comprising
discipline, air safety and accountability is not a healthy
solution in reducing the rate of airline accidents. The civil
aviation needs to cast its net wider both in terms of discipline
105

and also air safety measures which needs not only a long term
strategy but also immediate plan of action. It is no secret that
aircraft is one item which is not available on a shelf. It is
generally observed that from the management point of view,
from the time of selection ordering; including selection of
various optimal equipment, training of pilots and engineers
take time and such a gestation period runs into years and
should not be reduced at short notice in aviation which leads
to disasters. Thus, to improve discipline in air safety, civil
aviation needs not a fresh coat of paint, but a major surgery.
Viewing it from another angle how can an organisation
survive, let alone grow, when indiscipline is its hallmark and
disunity its load-star? The different wings of aviation whether
civil aviation or otherwise, need frequent interactions by way
of mutual discussions on the subject to clear its ideological
cobwebs which seems to have been deepened since long. It
would be a healthy sign that all the organisational heads of
different wings hold frequent conferences to discuss issues like
air safety, discipline and management etc. During such
discussions, they express their views frankly and fearlessly. We
should not forget that when indiscipline takes over the goal is
defeated. No doubt each wing of the aviation establishment
has many honest, intelligent and efficient prime heads, but
facts revealed from air crashes/happenings indicate that they
lack unity, cohesiveness and aboveall to some extent discipline
of these drawbacks deter from looking ahead.
106

It would be worthwhile to state the growth of domestic
passenger traffic within the last eight years in a tabulated
form.
PASSENGERS GROWTH
CARRIED FRATE
(In Millions) (%age)
1987-88 9.93
1988-89 9.54 - 3.9
1989-90 9.39 - 1.6
1990-91 7.47 -20.4
1991-92 8.36 +11.9
1992-93 7.99 - 4.4
1993-94 9.73 +21.8
1994-95 10.88 +11.8
From the data relating to the growth of domestic and
international passengers during the last eight years, submitted
by the Office of Director General of civil Aviation, it is clear
that Indian aviation is booming again after a long period of
stagnancy. Today tourism has become a basic human right
making it a world's largest industry. The close scrutiny of the
data given to this court indicate an appreciable rise in
domestic as well as passenger air traffic in this country. This
Court can take judicial notes of the "Open sky" policy of the
Government whereby private airlines have also been allowed
107

to participate to fly its fleet. The "three tier formula"
propounded by Director General of Civil Aviation under
which the private airlines are required to fly 10 per cent of
their total services in the different areas like North-East,
Jammu and Kashmir sectors as also non-trunk routes which do
not yield profit, has not deterred the private entrepreneurs
from joining the airline scenario. The aviation boom would
have touched great heights, but for the plague which created
a major set-back with international traffic coming down by as
much as 30 per cent in the month of October, 1994. Yet the
figures of the domestic as also international passengers air
traffic is comparatively more than that of the year 1993. From
comparative data, one can safely conclude digital air traffic
growth in the days to come which would be the outcome of
the growth in traffic alone. From this point of view as well the
aviation establishments are required to ensure the air safety
measures. In this regard, the role of DGCA becomes
extremely significant and important. Presently it regulates
merely the capacity or monitor fares but in the times to come
its prime duty would be to ensure that operations are carried
out without compromising safety. In the new situation, the
DGCA will need cost accountants, expert fliers and practising
engineers to impose its will on airlines and to educate them
about the requirements. Thus, the very structure of DGCA
needs also a drastic change in as much as it should become an
independent and highly professional authority on the lines of
Federal Aviation Authority (FAA), U.S.A. Resultantly, its
staff is also needed to be recruited strictly on the lines of the
Rules and Regulations framed by FAA. There is no gain
saying the fact that DGCA is working in a democratic set-up,
108

but it is also true that out of various forms of Government
democracy have found to be the most acceptable form of
governance, it being the mother of highest virtue, wisdom and
symbol of progress humanity. It is also a school of teaching,
wisdom, self-respect, tolerance as also an instrument of
prompt character and personality of all citizens. Unless a
citizen whether in service or not does not build up his national
character and discipline himself to discharge his duties
entrusted to him faithfully, he cannot contribute towards
development at process because in otherwise case, the reign of
selfishness, absolute greed and irrelevance of the inteligentia
in the present political conditions would dominate the will of
one and all and the aviation establishments like others are
bound to wither away. In this view of the matter, enforcement
of self discipline, adherence to rules and regulations are the
prime requirements regarding which efforts for raising the
awareness of one and all working in the establishments is
needed to be raised. To sum up there appears to be the need
of adopting modern concept in air traffic management,
keeping pace with the development in the field of aviation. It
is from this point of view that we intend to recommend
various suggestions relating to the improvement of air safety
measures.
5.2 Search and Rescue
Search and rescue are the two most important aspects of the
civil aviation industry in the country. With the rate of growth
of the aviation in the country, this wing is required to be
109

strengthened. I am constrained to observe that the airport
authorities at Kullu or at Delhi, despite having knowledge with
respect to the tour undertaken by a high dignitary, did not
emphatically try to find out as to what happened with the
aircraft in question after its departure from Chandigarh. The
Officers/officials of Bhuntar airfield may be absolved of the
liabilities for the simple reason that the aerodrome is not fully
equipped with the latest communication equipments and
whatsoever equipments were in their possession like NDB, FC-
10 and telephone, it did not work till 1030 hrs. IST. Civil
authorities had also reached the aerodrome at Bhuntar and
they were apprised of the time of arrival at Bhuntar airport
and late Shri Surendra Nath, the then Governor. As per the
oral testimony of various persons, Superintendent of Police,
Kullu, other political persons had also come to receive the
aforesaid dignitary at the aerodrome. Obviously, the flight was
much delayed. They even did not care to know about the
reason of delay. It is not only the duty of the civil aviation
authorities, but also concerned State authorities as well to
know about the programme of high dignitaries like the
Governor travelling in an aircraft. However, the moment civil
authorities were apprised of the accident through the police of
Police Post Chowki on the basis of an FIR lodged by Shri
Dittu Gujjar, PW 4, who witnessed the accident, they
immediately initiated search and rescue operation without any
delay. The part played by the Honourable Chief Minister of
Himachal Pradesh Shri Virbhadhar Singh is commendable.
While at Mandi, the moment he received this shocking
information, he directed the civil authorities i.e. District
Magistrate, Superintendent of Police and Chief Medical
110

Officer to send their respective teams to locate the crash site
without loss of time and extend all possible help, medical or
otherwise, to the needy persons. In the circumstances
emerging from the available records, we feel that some sort of
coordination are required to be developed amongst the civil
aviation authorities and public in general so that both may
work together in emergency.
As regards the FIC Delhi, Shri S.A. Ram, Director of
Aerodrome, Delhi Region of AAI has .in his affidavit stated
that neither Bhuntar nor any other NAA controlled airfield
had received any transmission from the aircraft of any
emergency or difficulty at any stage and its flight; that the
fateful flight was not under the radar control or surveillance
of any NAA controlled units. He has also stated that for the
flight from Chandigarh to Bhuntar, there are no
intermediatory reporting stations other than Alpha Control
Barnala which is an Indian Air Force controlled agency.
According to him, the first Air Traffic Service Unit receiving
the flight plan is responsible for the acceptance of the flight
plan or a change thereto in the following manner:-
a) Check it for compliance with format and data
conventions;
b) Check it for completeness and to the extent possible for
accuracy;
c) Take action, if necessary, to make it acceptable to the
Air Traffic Services; and
111

d)(cid:9) Indicate acceptance of the FPL or change thereto to the
originator.
He has neither given the time when information regarding
missing of the aircraft in question reported by authorities of
the Bhuntar aerodrome was received by FIC Delhi nor
pointed out the time as to when search and rescue party was
ordered to be deputed for the purpose of being sent to the
area where the aircraft in question have been lost. However,
as per the affidavit of Shri Amit Goel, PW-84, Aerodrome
Officer, Bhuntar airfield, he stated that at about 1030 hours he
came to know from those present in the VIP room that it had
become impossible to get through Raj Bhawan, Chandigarh,
and that the flight had departed from Chandigarh at 0847
hours IST, realising that the aircraft was already overdue, he
contacted WSO Delhi. He also states to have informed the
Superintendent of Police, Kullu for initiating search and rescue
measures. He then states that he followed the emergency
procedures by informing the local hospital and also the city
fire service. Later on, according to him, search helicopters
landed at Bhuntar at about 1430 hours for refuelling. Gp.
Capt. Suman Chopra of IAF has also stated that on the fateful
day Air Force Station, Chandigarh, had promptly initiated the
actions as listed in his "Pre-Accident" plan, on receipt of the
message from Alpha Control regarding aircraft call sign VUJ,
not being in contact. He has not given any time but it appears
that after 1030 hours IST two helicopters were launched for
"search and rescue" from Air Force Station, Sarsawa at
approximately 12.15 hours. From this statement, it appears
that search and rescue operations were though initiated, yet it
112

was much delayed. Later on, on losing contact with the
helicopters, AN-32 aircraft had also been sent from
Chandigarh airfield to climb overhead and act as airborne
ATC. Air Force Authorities, as per their version, were
apprised of the recovery of the 13 dead bodies and that there
was no survivors at about 1740 hours IST. These facts
positively indicate lack of cooperation/coordination,
cohesiveness and liaison in between the two organisational
wings of the aviation i.e. civil and defence. This observation
I am making after having gone through the entire
correspondence exchanged in-between the Air Force
authorities and Airports authority of India wherein civil
defalcations having been committed by the crew members of
the civil aircrafts have been reported, but despite requests
from one another, i.e. the civil and Defence aviation
authorities, no joint meeting could be held nor any common
solution could be arrived at to solve the day-to-day problems.
The correspondence reflects certain secret inquiries having
been conducted by the respective authorities of which we do
not consider to point out in our report at this hour. We feel,
the constitution of a joint Board in respect of not only
training, but also control and supervision of the technical, non-
technical, operational, non-operational as also the executive
personnel of the civil authorities working in Civil Aviation
wing or with the Defence authorities on deputation, has
become absolutely essential. It would be in the fitness of
things that the Ministry of Civil Aviation also interacts with
the Ministry of Defence and directs the holding of a joint
meeting of the responsible members of all organisational wings
of the aviation for constituting a board/apex body in relation
113

to the above said purpose. Creation of such a joint board is
also needed for the reason that air space zones seems to have
been already created under the Rules. Some airfields are
being controlled by Air Traffic Controllers belonging to the
Air Force Authorities (Defence) and others are exclusively
being manned by ATC Controllers of Civil Aviation
Authorities. Their zones have been defined. Under the rules,
some air space zone comes under the FIC (Flight Information
Centre). All of them claim that they are only responsible for
imparting service information to the crew members in case of
distress messages only and otherwise they cannot exercise their
control over the flight as approved in the flight plan submitted
to Air Traffic Controller. According to them, once the aircraft
in question goes out of their Air Traffic Controlled Zone to
the next zone either controlled by Air Traffic controller
civilian or Defence or by the other information centre, their
duty ends. It is only in distress call messages that they start
functioning to extend the help to the crew members of the
concerned aircraft.
In the instant inquiry, aircraft in question started from
Chandigarh airfield, which is controlled by ATC Chandigarh
belonging to Air Force. Under the Rules/regulations, their Air
Traffic Control zone is upto 20 nautical miles. On the
contrary, Bhuntar airfield is controlled by Airports Authority
of India. Their control zone is upto 5 nautical miles. The
distance between Chandigarh airport and Bhuntar airfield is
more than 85 nautical miles. Both air traffic controllers at two
different aerodromes say that in-between space zone is under
control of Flight Information Centre, New Delhi. As already
114

pointed out, the later claimed that they are responsible to
provide service information only at the behest of the Pilot-in-
Command of the concerned aircraft, otherwise they are not
empowered to direct the control on flight even in their zone.
These different stands taken by different wings of the
organisational authorities, do require the interaction in-
between responsible persons heading the two organisational
wings with the intervention of the Ministry of Civil Aviation as
also that of Ministry of Defence to chalk out the ways and
means to solve such like problems which daily arise. In case,
it is not so done, increase in accidents, to my mind, are
inevitable.
5.3 Accident Prevention Cell
There is a saying that 'prevention is better than cure'. This is
more important in aviation as it may not be possible to cure
the effects of an accident when many times result into large
number of fatalities. It is, therefore, absolutely essential in
aviation that all possible prevention measures be taken to
ensure that safety measures are not only maintained but
continuously enhanced. This aspect has been earlier examined
by a Court of Inquiry headed by Justice U.C. Banerjee and
after detailed deliberations the Court had recommended in
1989 that the Air Safety Directorate of the DGCA should be
strengthened to set up a new dedicated cell for accident
prevention work. During the course of investigation of the
subject accident, it came to my knowledge that the
Government created a post of one Deputy Director to
115

discharge functions of accident prevention in aviation. Justice
U.C. Banerjee while investigating another accident in 1991 had
again recommended that the one-man accident prevention Cell
existing in DGCA is totally inadequate to discharge accident
prevention and as such it should be restructured and
strengthened without any loss of further time.
The aforesaid discussion pertaining to the accident in question
indicate the ineffectiveness of the Prevention Cell of not only
civilian but also Air Force authorities as well. Obviously, the
civilian authorities located at Delhi simply contacted the Air
force authorities and instead of initiating search and rescue
operations at their won level, they felt satisfied with the
attempt being made by the Indian Air Force authorities. The
consumption of time in knowing the fact as to the recovery of
the dead bodies as also that there were no survivors speak
volumes of the efficiency of the search and rescue wing of
both organisations i.e. civilian as also Indian Air Force
authorities.
It has come to the knowledge of this Court that the Accident
Prevention Cell despite earlier recommendations still
continues to be manned only by one officer even though the
aviation activities in India have been increased very fast
(nearly 20% per annum). The present set-up of the DGCA
handling the Air Safety subject is concentrating largely on
accident/incident investigation which is more or less like a post
mortem. Though it is very essential to investigate every
accident and incident to find out the cause of such occurrences
and to take preventive measures, it is inadequate to ensure
116

safety in aviation. If aviation safety is to be given the due
importance and the safety of the travelling public is to be
ensured, the Government must immediately strengthen the
existing One-Man Accident Prevention Cell. The Cell should
be headed by an Officer of the level of at least a Director and
should consist of adequate number of professionals in the
fields of flying and engineering. This Prevention Cell is
immediately needed to be revamped in strength, howsoever
cost-oriented it may be. From the past experience, we are
observing the notable growth in aviation in the country which
also requires that in the absence of perfect use of safety
measure equipments, accidents are prone to happen in large
numbers. At such emergent occasions, the existence of
Accident Prevention Cell is absolutely essential. I again
strongly recommend to the Ministry of Civil Aviation to look
into the matter keenly on this aspect on top priority basis.

CHAPTER - IV
6. FINDINGS OF FACTS
1. The flight from Chandigarh airfield to Bhuntar airfield
was initially planned in Beechcraft C-90 aircraft, which
was to be piloted by Capt. R.D.S. Sandhu, the Pilot-in-
Command and Capt. Vivek Mehra, as Co-Pilot.
2. The C-90 aircraft was substituted by the newly
purchased aircraft VT-EUJ Super King Air B-200 at
about 2200 hours IST on 8.7.1994 by the Pilot-in-
Command and Capt. Pargat Singh Nanar was directed
to replace Capt. Vivek Mehra as Co-Pilot with him as
Capt. Mehra was not qualified to operate the aircraft in
question.
3. Beechcraft Super King Air B-200 aircraft VT-EUJ
belonged to the Punjab Government. The aircraft was
new and had valid Certificate of Airworthiness since
15.3.1994.
4. The aircraft VT-EUJ was registered in Passenger
Category and its maximum all-up-weight was 5,669.90
kgs. i.e. below 5,700 kgs.
5. The aircraft in question was maintained in accordance
with the approved maintenance schedules and it was
118

fully airworthy prior to its departure from Chandigarh
and during the course of the entire flight till it crashed.
6. The Aircraft did not have a Cockpit voice Recorder
(CVR) or Flight Data Recorder (FDR) fitted in it. Nor
did the Aircraft have a Ground Proximity Warning
System (GPWS). The existing regulations do not
require fitment of these equipments on Beech Super
King Air B-200 type of aircraft.
7. As per the Flight ,Plan filed with the IAF ATC,
Chandigarh, the aircraft was to operate on the day of
accident on sectors Chandigarh-Bhuntar-Chandigarh-
Ludhiana-Chandigarh. ETD Chandigarh on the first leg
was 0800 hours IST and ETA Bhuntar was 0820 hours
IST.
8. The aircraft had no pending snag and had adequate fuel
for the flight.
9. The enroute weather as informed to the fateful Aircraft
at 0846 IST by an Archana Airways Aircraft, which was
on its flight from Kulu to Shimla, was, cumulous clouds
between Bilaspur and Sundar Nagar - Kullu Valley
clear.
10. The flight crew were duly trained on the aircraft in
question for the requisite period as per the syllabus laid
down by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), USA,
by the Institution of the Flight Safety International
119

USA. However, both of them lacked sufficient
experience in flying the aircraft in question in
mountainous region.
11. The flight crew had neither instrument rating nor they
had conducted trial landing at any of the aerodromes
located in mountainous region in the aircraft in
question. In fact, it was their maiden flight to Bhuntar
airfield in this type of aircraft which is located in
between narrow valleys.
12. The flight crew had appropriate and valid licences to
operate the flight. Both the pilots had been declared
medically fit throughout their flying career.
13. The PIC had total flying experience of over 7,500 hours,
of which about 100 hours was on type B-200 as PIC.
Neither the PIC, nor the Co-Pilot had Instrument
Rating on Beech Super King Air B-200.
14. As per log books, the Pilot-in-Command had last flown
to Bhuntar on 2.6.1992 in King Air C-90. There is no
known record of the co-Pilot having flown to Bhuntar.
15. As per Order of the Punjab Government No.9/39/92-
4T(3)/17277 dated 10.10.1992, which was in force on
9.7.1994, relatives of the Governor were not authorised
to use the Government aircraft, except with the
permission of the Chief Minister of Punjab. As per
available evidence/records, including affidavits filed by
120

officials of the Punjab Government, no such permission
had been granted in the present case.
16. Seating capacity with belts of VT-EUJ aircraft in
question consisted of only seven passengers, plus two
crew members. There were in all ten passengers plus
three crew members on board the aircraft during the
fateful flight. Though baggage area had provision for
installing two-folding seats with belts but they were not
installed and baggage area was used for baggage only.
Thus four passengers were travelling without safety
belts.
17. Chandigarh Air Traffic Control Tower cleared the
aircraft to depart to Bhuntar on flight level 90 via flight
plan route.
18. The Aircraft took off from Chandigarh at 0850 hours
IST. Capt. R.D.S. Sandhu, Chief Pilot of Punjab
Government was the PIC and Capt. P.S. Nanar was the
Co-Pilot. Apart from the Flight Attendant Shri Pandey,
there were 10 passengers, comprising the late Governor
of Punjab and Himachal Pradesh and 9 members of his
family, including four children.
19. At 0853 hours IST, the aircraft climbed and reported
overhead Chandigarh at 7,000 feet and set course for
Bhuntar. The estimated timings, as given by PIC to
Chandigarh Tower and to Alpha Control, were abeam
121

Bilaspur 0902 hours IST and arrival Bhuntar 0910 hours
IST.
20. At no stage of the flight, the aircraft reported any
real/anticipated emergency, nqr did it report any sudden
deterioration in enroute weather.
21. The flight crew did not adhere to the operational flight
plan and rather deviated from the pre-determined route
on entering Sundar Nagar area while proceeding to
Bhuntar airfield.
22. At 0856 hours IST, the aircraft reported 10 miles from
Chandigarh and being in contact with Alpha Control,
Barnala and changed over to Alpha Control.
23. At 0901 hours IST, the aircraft reported checking
abeam Bilaspur and maintaining flight level 90.
24. The Aircraft was in contact with Alpha Control till 0902
hours IST, when the PIC was told to call Alpha
Control, when in contact with Bhuntar.(cid:9) This
transmission was acknowledged by the aircraft at
0902.45 hours IST and this was the last contact with the
Aircraft.
25. As per AIC 16/92, Bhuntar airfield is fit for VFR
operations only, since it is surrounded by hills. Bhuntar
airfield is controlled by Airports Authority of India,
while Chandigarh is an IAF airfield.
122

26. As per AIP India, for the sector Chandigarh-Bhuntar of
the ATS Route W-35, the upper/lower limits of flight
level are 460/150 and the minimum flight altitude is
12,600 feet.
27. Bhuntar Air Traffic Control did not receive at any time
the flight plan or ETA of the fateful flight from ATC
Chandigarh or through FIC Delhi, or from any other
agency.
28. No departure message of aircraft in question had been
passed on by ATC Chandigarh to Bhuntar or FIC Delhi
or any other concerned authority.
29. No communication from flight crew of the aircraft in
question with respect to distress message was received
either by ATC Chandigarh or Alpha Control Barnala or
FIC Delhi, nor it had any contact with Bhuntar
aerodrome authorities.
30. FC-10 in Flight Information Centre, Delhi Airport was
not manned at material time. STD (Telephone) was
though in working order, the Bhuntar airport authorities
could not have any contact with Airport Authorities of
Delhi except WSO till 1030 hours IST.
31. The first information of the accident reached official
agencies at Sundar Nagar at about 1130 hours IST same
day. Due to absence of precise details of site and the
hilly terrain, the ground rescue team could reach the
123

site only by 1530 hours IST or so. There were no
survivors.
32. Heliborne search for the aircraft was mounted by two
helicopters at 1205 hours and 1230 hours respectively,
but due to cloudy weather, hill tops could not be
searched and the wreckage was not sighted, but distress
signals were being received.
33. Before the impact with the standing trees at the crash
site, the flight crew had attempted to pull up the
aircraft and thereby on impact with the trees, it had cut
and damaged the same at about 40 degree nose up
before it ultimately hit against a boulder just below the
top of Kamroo Nag Hill located in Sundar Nagar Sub-
Division nearby Bhuntar airfield in Kullu district.
34. The site of crash is within the designated airspace VIR
150, which airspace as per AIP India RAC 5-22
constituted the local flying area of Chandigarh and the
controlling authority for the same being ATC
Chandigarh.
— (cid:9) 35. None of the crew members or the passengers had
survived in the air crash in question.
36. Search and rescue operations by the public in general,
civil and Defence authorities could not be carried out
immediately after the crash.
124

37. There was no evidence to indicate any sabotage or
inflight structural failure of the aircraft.
38. At the relevant time, Capt. R.D.S. Sandhu, since
diseased, was the overall incharge of the flying
operations of Civil Aviation, Punjab in his independent
capacity.
39. Capt. R.D.S. Sandhu, Pilot-in-Command being overall
Incharge of the operations in his independent capacity,
seems to have become the blue eyed boy of his political
bosses as is evident from his conduct in having allowed
other persons to travel with high dignitary i.e. the then
Governor of Punjab and Himachal Pradesh without
permission. From the subsequent flight scheduled for
Ludhiana immediately after returning from Bhuntar
airfield for carrying the VIP i.e. the Chief Minister of
Punjab, it appears that he was under constant mental
pressure from inception of the flight in question.
125

7. PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT
The accident occurred due to serious error on the part of the
flight crew by not strictly adhering to the VFR conditions for
flight to Bhuntar airfield. As a result, the aircraft after
encountering cumulous clouds enroute, deviated from the pre-
determined route and collided with the hill top covered with
clouds.
_ (cid:9) The contributory factors to the accident were:-
a) Existence of bad weather enroute with cumulous clouds
in layers covering the hill tops;
b) Pilots not conversant with the topography of the
mountains in the region;
c) Failure on the part of the flight crew not to refer and
follow the maps of the region;
d) Mental pressure on the Pilot-in-Command to complete
the flight in time with a view to meet the subsequent
flight commitments; and
e) Failure on the part of the Co-Pilot to bring out flight
deviations to the notice of the commander.
126

8. RECOMMENDATIONS
Since accidents generally result from a chain of events leading
upto a mishap, there is seldom a single cause. An accident can be
prevented by breaking the chain of errors of any point. All of this
provides a way to start looking at how small improvements can be
made to the (aviation) system to provide benefit. Our discussions
with Aviation authorities (both that of Government and private) at
Zurich (Switzerland) reveal that they follow Cross-air (Swiss Aviation
Operator) procedures which incorporate some accident prevention
strategies being explored by the international group led by the Flight
Safety Foundation, which is trying to reduce accidents involving
controlled-flight-into-terrain (CFIT). As per these, it is possible to
break this chain of events in a number of ways including improved
training for the First Officers. BASIS allows the data to be sorted
by aircraft type, registration number, type of event, airport, phase of
flight, type of action taken and the type of aircraft system involved.,
These observations help to identify trends to prompt management
action. A key part of the training involving teaching the captain, to
make the right decision on whether to complete the steep approach
and land on a short runway or execute a go-around. As per the
information imparted to us, Cross-air Saab 340s operate into short
runways in the Alps (Lugano, Sion and Bern airports) using specially
developed procedures. Captains are required to have a year of
experience in the left seat before taking the training, which starts
with class-room work as well as viewing videos and terrain models.
Thus operating regional aircraft on a scheduled basis to airports in
the mountains requires experience, practice and the use of well-
thought out procedures in this country. The airports located in the
mountainous regions in India are more hazardous than referred to
127

above. In that view, strenuous training is needed to be imparted to
all the concerned authorities including the pilots in particular. Thus,
we have a lot of evangelical work to do. Winds of change are
"Sweeping the globe." Thus national task force of flying safety,
experts from aviation establishments should jointly work on a broad-
based system to deal with a civil aviation flying safety problem for
reducing accidents involving controlled-flight-into terrain (CFIT) in
particular. The reason why it has become the focus of attention is
that CFIT accidents account for the vast majority of fatalities in civil
aviation. CFIT risk is generally higher in India than in other parts
of the world. As told by Earl F. Weener, Chief Engineer for
airplane reliability, maintainability and safety, at the Boeing
Commercial Airplane Group to regional airline officials at a recent
Flight Safety Foundation Conference that 100 people, besides other
groups like International Air Transport Association, International
Foundation of Airline Pilots Association, aircraft manufacturers,
regulatory authorities and airlines and airport officials are now
working on various aspects of the problem. In this regard, thus, my
recommendations would be :
1.(cid:9) A critical review of all Controlled Flight Into Terrain
(CFIT) accidents in India during the past 15 years
should be carried out by DGCA urgently and factors
leading to such accidents should be identified. The
training curriculum of pilots should focus on actions on
the part of flight crew to prevent such accidents in
future.
128

2. All operators engaged in public air transport operations
should develop programmes to create awareness
amongst the pilots and corporate managers regarding
the CFIT problem. For this purpose, CFIT risk
assessment check-list should be prepared and followed
as is being done by Flight Safety International of USA.
3. Minimum Safe Altitude Warning System (MSAW) is
neither available nor being used by ATC in India like
FAA approach control facilities in the U.S. It is an
invaluable tool for helping controllers catch the type of
mistakes that lead to CFIT accidents. The software
based system alerts the controller when the airplane is
flying too low for a particular area. Thus the airport
authority should make sure that MSAW is added to
ATC radar (wherever it exists) as part of upgrades, now
in progress.
4. GPWS (Ground Proximity Warning System) is the key
piece of equipment to help prevent CFIT accidents in
the present day advanced technology though it serves as
a last resort warning that a collision with terrain is
imminent. It may be noted that GPWS false alarm
rates are no longer a problem with the latest generation
of equipment as they were with the original version.
The equipment is though costly, yet it should be
directed to be introduced in all airplanes of seating
capacity of ten or more or all-up-weight exceeding 5,700
kgs.
129

5. In case of GPWS equipped airplanes, the pilot(s) should
compulsorily be subjected to adequate training to
acquaint himself regarding the use of such system as
without proper pilots' training, GPWS is useless. Such
pilot(s) should be trained to react immediately to
GPWS warning until the GPWS warning stops except in
visual meteorological conditions, when it is clear that
there is no hazard.
6. Pilots required to operate flights in hilly terrain, should
be given training, in addition to the normal training, on
special precautions required to be taken while operating
in the mountainous terrain which should include class-
room training, viewing training videos and terrain
models, practising on simulators the emergency
procedures particularly, procedures to deal with engine-
out situation etc. Before permitting pilots to operate
independently as Pilot-in-Command flights to airports
in the hilly terrain :
a) They should acquire at least one year's
experience in such operations as Co-Pilot or
under supervision.
b) They should undergo a minimum of two route
checks for day flying and a minimum of five
route checks for night flying to airports located in
hilly region.
130

7. Standard operating procedures including minimum safe
altitudes on routes in hilly terrain should be reviewed
jointly by Airports Authority of India, DGCA and
Defence Authorities wherever concerned. The
operators and the Airport Authorities of civil and
Defence should thereafter follow the revised
procedures.
8. An Air Traffic Controller of Airports Authority of India
or from Defence services trained in accordance with
ICAO requirements should be positioned at each Air
Traffic Control unit of Defence handling civil traffic like
Alpha Control, Chandigarh Airport etc.
9. STD/Hot line facilities should be provided with the
Duty Officers handling the civil air traffic at Alpha
Control (i.e. Air Force Stations at Barnala and
Amritsar) and other airfields in this region, but
specifically at Chandigarh, Bhuntar, Shimla and Gaggal
airports, so that proper coordination can be achieved
with other Air Traffic Control units in the area.
10. Feasibility study of installing a suitable radar or satellite
based surveillance system, to provide positive control
over air traffic in Kullu/Himachal hilly areas, should be
carried out and such facilities should be provided at the
earliest, if found feasible.
11. Airports Authority of India should provide VOR/NDB
on top of the hill located in between Mandi and Pandoh
131

in Himachal Pradesh to assist in safe navigation
between Chandigarh and Bhuntar.
Pilots operating flights to/from airfields surrounded by
12.
hilly terrain should be specifically checked and cleared
on the type of aircraft for each airfield for such
operations before a pilot is allowed to operate
independently in hilly areas.
The pilots should maintain recency of flying in hilly
13.
areas and should have operated a flight to an airport in
such area at least once during the preceding twelve
months. In the absence of this recency experience, the
pilot should operate the flight to that airport under the
supervision of an Examiner or carry out a refresher
flight without passengers on board.
A system of joint review of air traffic control procedures
14.
followed for civil aircraft operating under Defence air
traffic control systems, should be instituted to ensure
that the standards laid down by International Civil
Aviation Organisation for civil flights are fully complied
with. For this purpose air traffic controllers of Defence
services and Airports Authority of India should meet
frequently.
A standing high level review group consisting of
15.
Chairman, Airports Authority of India, DGCA and
Assistant Chief of Air Staff (Operations) should be
constituted to take policy decisions regarding handling
132

of civil flights by Defence Air Traffic Control Units and
provision of facilities at Defence airfields for the same.
The Group should also frame such rules pursuant to the
policy decision so as to keep a watch and work in
tantrum as a proctorial team.
16. The Government should immediately strengthen the
existing One-Man Accident Prevention Cell in the office
of the DGCA. The Cell should be headed by an
. Director and should
Officer of the level of at least a
consist of adequate number of professionals in the fields
of Air Traffic Control, flying and engineering.
State Government should consider giving better
17. The
emoluments to their pilots keeping in view the higher
salaries being given to the pilots in commercial airlines
so that :-
the best talent is available to the State
a)
Governments whose planes are used mainly by
VIPs; and
the pilots are accorded a superior status, which
b)
should help them to withstand pressure to fly
against their better judgment.
18. The operators should ensure that all their executives are
fully familiar with the aviation requirements and
procedures. The Officer heading the aviation wing
should have aviation background and should be given
133

full authority and responsibility to run the aviation wing
in compliance of all safety norms. He may be given
status of Additional Secretary.
19. All categories of employees of Airports Authority of
India i.e. aerodrome, communication and managerial
personnel should be imparted systematic and continuous
but periodical training to cater to the individual
developmental need as well as that of the organisation,
in human supervisory behavioural and managerial skills
by organising human resource-based as also continuing
professional development-based training programmes
with a view to make them excellent in their functional
knowledge. Simultaneously, they should be motivated
to have a dedicated approach and play an active role in
the day-to-day affairs of the organisation to enhance
their professional standing and raising the profile of
their professional field in aviation.
20. It should be made mandatory by every operator for
every employee to submit to them a self-appraisal
format/proforma once every year during tenure of his
service duly filled up and revealing as to:
a)(cid:9) Has he done well in his present job?
Could he do better?
c)(cid:9) Where and in what role does he see his future?
134

d) What new knowledge or technical skill does he
need for the future role?
e) What resources are available to him?
What development method should he use or
suggest to acquire the new knowledge or skills?
(cid:9)
What deficiency does he feel that exists in the
g)
system which can improve the maintenance and
safety standard.
The operator will review these reports and submit to
DGCA their analysis and action taken on the important
observations.
21. For gearing up in-house training activity to all
employees, specially in air traffic control wings, the
concerned aviation establishments of both civil as well
as Defence should frequently organise joint
development programmes in collaboration with each
other by pooling their resources and efforts in this
direction not only at the Headquarters but also at
Regional headquarters.
22. In view of the significant rapid changes all around us
like globalisation, liberalisation, total continuous
improvement (TCI), total quality management (TWM)
etc., DGCA should issue directions (mandatory in
nature) laying down that every Air Traffic controller
135

must undergo Computer Based Training (CBT). The
Air Traffic Control Officers who are upgraded as Radar
Controllers should undergo training on CBT simulators
for radar control for the laid down period to maintain
high standard of his professional competence including
the handling of emergencies in real time scenario.
23. In order to overcome inherent restrictions and tendency
of being subjective, the aviation establishments and
Defence should induct/deploy Computer Based
Technology equipments marketed under the brand
name WOMBAT-FC or any other equivalent having the
same capability for the selection of Air Traffic
Controllers at the recruitment stage which is an
ingenious device that measures the human capabilities
and reflexes needed for a job as professional as such.
24. The operators engaged in public air transport should
record and manifest, the passengers carried on each
flight.
25. The operators should ensure that the pre-flight medical
check of the pilots is carried out.
26. DGCA should be made an independent body like FAA
of USA and should not be under the Ministry of Civil
Aviation. Revamping and restructuring of the staff is
also required on the same lines as in FAA, USA.
136

27. At Delhi airport, the Flight Information Centre should
be manned and also the communication facilities like
FC-10 etc. be made and maintained fully serviceable.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Before parting with the inquiry, my sincere thanks to the
Assessors Capt. D.K. Sharma, Chief Operations Manager (Air Safety
and Training), Vayudoot Ltd. (Now Indian Airlines) and Shri K.B.
Batra, Chief Engineer, Border Security Force for providing me their
valuable but useful assistance in completing the inquiry by their
expert knowledge on the subject.
Before I record my appreciation to the various civil aviation
organisations in India, my sincere thanks go to M/s Raytheon
Company (Beechcraft), Wichita, USA, particularly Mr. Dean
Thompson, Manager, NTSB (Liaison); Mr. Edde Webber and their
other associates. I also extend my appreciation for the extremely
valuable and useful assistance given by Capt. Don Orlando of Flight
Safety International, USA who extended all facilities to us for
carrying out simulator exercises on the type of aircraft in question as
also to acquaint ourselves with the procedure of training of pilots.
I must appreciate the useful information given to us by the
Officers of Civil Aviation, Switzerland by Capt. Balsiger, Chief of
Flight Operations, as also by Zemix Aviation, Swiss registered
operator through Capt. Nick Hater. I am indeed happy to have met
the above said officers more so by reason of their untiring efforts in
coordinating the whole programme of study of the training culture
in their country in flying as also the information provided to us
regarding safety measures taken not only by regulatory authority of
Switzerland, but also the operators being controlled by them.
138

I record my sincere thanks to the manufacturers of the aircraft
(Raytheon Company), the sincerity with which the manufacturer of
the aircraft in question responded to the queries of this Court of
Inquiry needs special praise. The Company never showed any
reluctance to assist the Court in any sphere. Special arrangements
were made at Wichita with Flight Safety International for carrying
out exercises in the simulator of aircraft in question at the request of
this Court. The Company also sent their representative to India at
the behest of the Court of Inquiry for the purpose of assisting us by
his oral evidence and documentary presentation before the Court.
During the course of investigation, I came to know Shri H.S.
Khola, Director General of Civil Aviation and in him I found an
efficient, knowledgeable, devoted, hard-working and sincere and
aboveall a highly competent technical official of the Central
Government. It would not have been possible for me to complete
the inquiry, had he not spared his staff or arranged for the facilities
provided to me from time to time during the course of investigation.
I found him extremely helpful in assisting me in critical analysis of
highly complex technical and operational aspects in respect of
accident in question. I sincerely wish him all success in life and pray
to the Almighty that Shri Khola should continue to work with such
devotion for all times to come.
I am very grateful to Shri V.K. Chandna, Director of Air
Safety and Inspector of Accidents in this investigation who by his
experience and expertise on the subject, provided sufficient material
for initiating the investigation after conducting preliminary inquiry in
the above said capacity. I would be failing in my duty if I don't
express my appreciation for his sincerity and hard-work together with
139

his desire to fulfil all the needs of the Court. Shri Chandna has
helped me to an enormous extent to bring to a fruitful end of the
task assigned to me. The report submitted by him is also very
comprehensive and assisted me in every sphere of my inquiry.
My sincere thanks go to Air Marshal D.R. Nadkarni, Inspector
General of Air Force; Air Cmdr. I.J.S. Boparai, Director Flight
Safety and other IAF Officers stationed at Delhi, Chandigarh and
Barnala including Gp. Capt. T. Pannu and Wg. Cdr. V. Nagpal. I
record with appreciation their sincere help and assistance given to me
by all of them.
Needless to say that officers of the Airports Authority of India
previously National Airports Authority and International Airports
Authority of India extended all kinds of help and provided facilities
to this Court in acquainting ourselves with the working of Air Traffic
Control system, navigation and communication facilities. My sincere
thanks go to Shri K. Ramalingam, Executive Director and other
associated officers.
I also record my appreciation to one and all of Border Security
Force (Air Wing) who extended this Court the facility of
familiarisation of the Super King Air B-200 aircraft in their hangar.
I am also grateful to Air Cmdr. C.M. Singla, VrC, CMD
Pawan Hans Limited for having made our visit fruitful in respect of
simulator exercises and acquainting ourselves with the working
thereof. It would not be out of place to mention that the
arrangements made for this purpose were praise-worthy.
140

I must also extend my thanks and record appreciation to Capt.
M.V.V. Rao and Shri P.B. Reddy of Central Training Establishment,
Indian Airlines, Hyderabad for providing us very useful information
regarding the training provided to the pilots on simulator. It would
be worthwhile to record that not only we were acquainted with the
mode of training on simulator, but also by actually carrying out the
simulator exercises. Such effort on their part too also has
contributed a lot for the appreciation of the material collected in the
instant investigation and resultant preparation of the report.
I want to specially record my high appreciation to the useful
assistance provided to this Court by the Government of Himachal
Pradesh and its officers particularly S/Shri R.K. Anand, Chief
Secretary to the Government of Himachal Pradesh; S.S. Negi,
Secretary, General Administration; M.L. Chouhan, Joint Secretary
and Tarun Sridhar, Deputy Commissioner, District Mandi. I also
extend my thanks and record appreciations to Shri B.S. Thakur, the
then Additional Director General, CID, Himachal Pradesh; Shri R.P.
Kureel, DIG and other Police officers connected with the inquiry.
The Court of Inquiry records its appreciation for Shri Lalit
Gupta, Assistant Director Air Safety, Office of the DGCA for his
highly dedicated, sincere and devoted efforts in assisting the Court
in all the spheres, whenever desired. I also record my sincere
appreciation for the services rendered by Shri R.K. Kohli, PA,
without whose assistance this report could not have been prepared
within the target date. He has been an asset to the Court since the
inception of this inquiry. I also extend my thanks to Shri S.K. Naik,
Section Officer and Shri Madan Lal, Aircraft Mechanic for rendering
141

valuable assistance from the very inception of the inquiry till its
completion.
I will be failing in my duty if I do not record my sincere
appreciation of the services rendered by Shri Ashok Sandev,
Secretary of this Court, without whose assistance neither this inquiry
could have been completed nor the report in question could have
been prepared. The untiring energy of this young dynainic
gentleman needs special mention and praise. I find in him an
efficient, knowledgeable, devoted, sincere arid hard-working officer.
I wish him success in his life and pray to the Almighty that Shri
Sandev should continue to act with such devotion, dynamism and
sincerity for all times to come.
While I thank all the lawyers who have assisted the Court in
its inquiry, I record my special appreciation for the assistance
rendered by Air Cmdr. N.A.K. Sarma; Ashok Aggarwal, Additional
Advocate General to the Government of Punjab; Shri Lalit Bhasin;
Shri Shishir Sharma; Ms. Mridul Sharma; for their invaluable service
to this Court of Inquiry. The clarity with which Air Cmdr. N.A.K.
Sarma represented the case on behalf of Airports Authority of India
is really praise-worthy. All the lawyers and parties in this inquiry
came forward to assist the Court which indicated their laudable
gesture.
Finally, my heart-felt condolences to the members of the
bereaved families, both of crew and of the passengers.
