SYNOPSIS
On 02.01.2023, M/s Indigo A321 Neo aircraft VT-ILR was involved in an incident
of tail strike at Kolkata while operating flight from Dhaka to Kolkata. There were
181 persons on board the aircraft including 02 Flight Crew, 05 Cabin Crew and 01
infant.
This was a supervised landing, FO was Pilot Flying (PF) and PIC was Pilot
Monitoring (PM). The aircraft touched down with slight bounce followed by high
nose pitch attitude that led to tail strike. ‘PITCH PITCH’ annunciation was also
heard.
The PIC reported ‘Tail Strike during landing’ and made the techlog entry. All the
persons on-board the aircraft were safe. No pre/post incident fire was reported.
DGCA instituted the investigation into the cause of incident by appointing the
Investigation In-charge under Rule 13(1) of the Aircraft (Investigation of Accidents
and Incidents) Rules, 2017.
The investigation revealed that continuous high pitch-up input by the FO while
landing causing the increase in pitch attitude of the aircraft after touchdown
attributed to the tail strike.
Lack of monitoring the flight parameters and no corrective input by PIC while
landing contributed to the incident.
1. FACTUAL INFORMATION
1.1. HISTORY OF THE FLIGHT:
On 02.01.2023, the aircraft VT-ILR departed from Hyderabad at 01:00 hrs. to
operate the first flight of the day from Hyderabad to Bhubaneshwar with a different
set of crew. On arrival at Bhubaneshwar the operating crew reported a snag of
‘SMOKE MAINT’ after engine shut-down. The aircraft was released by the AME
under MEL Category ‘C’ to operate further flights. The Aircraft operated two more
flights from Bhubaneshwar to Hyderabad and Hyderabad to Kolkata. NIL snag was
reported by the operating crew except the carry forwarded MEL.
Page 2 of 27

At Kolkata, the same aircraft was handed over to the involved set of crew to operate
a flight from Kolkata to Dhaka and return back to Kolkata. It was the first flight of
the day for both the crew. The aircraft was released by a certified AME after
carrying out the due transit inspection. The aircraft took-off from Kolkata at 08:42
Hrs and landed at Dhaka at 09:13 hrs. After landing the crew reported suspected
hard landing at Dhaka. Hard landing inspection was carried out as per the AMM
and no damage was reported. The aircraft was released for further flight.
The aircraft departed from Dhaka at 10:22 Hrs and took-off for Kolkata at 10:42
Hrs. During the take-off & cruise from Dhaka to Kolkata, the flying was normal. The
aircraft was cleared for ILS approach on runway 01R at Kolkata Airport and the
approach was normal. The FO was the pilot flying (PF) to perform the supervisory
landing and the PIC was the pilot monitoring (PM). While landing, a bounce was
observed and RH main wheel lifted up again after touch down for a fraction of
second and touched again. After touch down the pitch was increased to 10.7o that
led to the tail strike. No input from the PIC as PM was observed while approaching
for landing till touchdown. Crew reported the tail strike and made the tech log entry.
CVR and DFDR data was downloaded. No injury to any of the occupant and no fire
at any stage was reported. The aircraft was grounded for further inspection.

The involved aircraft was cleared for ILS approach on runway 01R.
1.11 FLIGHT RECORDERS:
The aircraft was fitted with CVR and DFDR type: CVDR
CVR : Part No. DM58-0048-10 S. No. 002039576
DFDR : Part No. 7100-0200-00 S. No. 002058798
DFDR:
As per DFDR data, the aircraft approach was normal till touch down. All the
parameters were within limit. The autopilot was disconnected at 1847ft RA for
manual approach. Auto thrust was active till 20ft RA. Wind component may not
be considered as significant as the wind speed remained between 1 to 4 kt.
Page 10 of 27

Below 40ft RA, the FO made continuous pitch up input. The input was small
and the aircraft remained in the profile. After crossing 20ft, the FO increased
pitch-up input significantly and reached to -7.3o. It caused significant decrease
in the ROD that was reduced to -224ft/min at 10ft RA. From 10ft RA, pitch up
input by FO started again increasing and reached 17.6o. Maximum pitch up
input can be -18o. At the time of first touchdown of LH main wheel, the pitch
angle of the aircraft was 5.7o. The aircraft landed on main wheel. LH main wheel
touched the runway first followed by RH main wheel. After 01 second of the
touchdown, the RH main wheel left the runway surface for about 01 second and
touched the surface again. However, due to continuous high pitch up input by
the FO, the pitch attitude of the aircraft started increasing after touch down and
reached 10.7o that caused the tail of the aircraft to touch the runway. The nose
wheel came in contact with runway surface after about 06 seconds of the initial
contact of main landing gear. Even after tail strike, while the nose wheel was in
the process of touching down, the FO continued pitch up input to its maximum
possible limit. However, due to decrease in ground speed after touchdown the
lift component reduced as per aerodynamic law and the aircraft itself started to
reduce its pitch. No input from the PIC observed during the flight even after
bounced landing and sudden increase in the pitch attitude of the aircraft while
landing. Maximum vertical acceleration at the time of touch down was recorded
as 1.523g that was within the limits. Relevant parameters of DFDR data below
100ft are reproduced below for the reference:

CVR:
As per CVR recording, in the previous sector, while landing at Dhaka airport,
crew suspected hard landing and made the techlog entry. The PIC briefed the
FO after landing advised him to keep the side stick slightly pulled up during
landing to arrest the ROD at the time of touch down.
For the incident flight, the approach was normal and PIC advised the FO to
continue for landing. While approaching, the landing checklist was performed.
PIC advised the FO to pull-up the side stick slightly. He repeated the same
Page 14 of 27

statement severally before touchdown. After touchdown, the PIC said that pitch
input by FO was high. Both the flight crew discussed the possibility of tail strike
after landing. During taxi, the cabin crew reported bad landing experienced in
the cabin and a loud sound heard at the time of landing. Then PIC admitted the
possibility of tail strike. The PIC was also aware of the Tail strike Prevention
System fitted on the aircraft and he discussed the same with the FO after
landing.
1.12 WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION:
In view of bounced landing, hard landing inspection was carried out and no
relative failure/damage was observed. During walk around inspection,
extensive tail strike damages observed on aft fuselage. Detailed inspection was
carried out by engineering team for internal and external damages and following
observations were made
External Damages

1.13 MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION:
Both the crew underwent pre-flight breath analyser check as per the provision
of CAR Section 5 Series F Part III. No indication of alcohol consumption by any
of the involved crew was observed during the check.
1.14 FIRE:
There was no pre/post incident fire.
1.15 SURVIVAL ASPECTS:
All the persons on-board the aircraft including 07 crew members were safe.
1.16 TESTS AND RESEARCH:
M/s Airbus was contacted by the operator for further examination of the damage
and necessary maintenance action. M/s Airbus examined the whole aircraft for
possible damage, deformation, cracks or paintwork. All the tail section fittings,
jack points, drain fittings, waste water fittings, waste mast, toilet systems,
Landing gear doors and their attachments, APU door fittings and its
attachments to the fuselage, belly fairings etc. were examined. Sealants with
cracks were removed to examine any further damage to the structure. All the
floor panels, side wall panels and overhead panels of the aft cargo compartment
and service panels were removed for necessary structural repair/maintenance
work.
All the damaged structural fittings, systems components, waste lines, hoses,
drain mast, toilet system etc, were replaced/repaired as per Airbus approved
procedures. Sections S17 and S18 lower shells and internal structure suffered
several damages due to Tail Strike.
- S18 Lower equipped shell replacement done as per repair references
- S17 between FR63-64 flush skin repairs done as per repair references
- Embodiment deviations repaired as per repair references
On completion of required maintenance and repair work, all the service panels
and internal panels of aft cargo compartment were installed.
All the damages/cracks/deformations observed during the inspection were
caused by the impact of aircraft due tail strike. No abnormality in the movement
or unbalancing of flight controls was reported before the incident that can cause
Page 18 of 27

deviation in pitch or roll attitude of the aircraft. The MEL on ‘Smoke Maintenance
Msg’ was revoked on 03.01.2023.

1.18 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
As per the PIC statement, the FO was the PF. The runway in use in Kolkata
was 01R and the type of approach was ILS. The approach was conducted with
Flaps Full and Autobrake Low. The aircraft was fully stabilised by 1500 ft. The
aircraft was flown manually from approximately 1500 ft. The touchdown was in
the touchdown zone. After the touchdown there was a slight bounce and during
that the FO pulled the side stick back which resulted in nose high pitch attitude
and PITCH PITCH annunciation came. He further submitted that before he
could give his input the tail had already hit the runway. After parking, the tail
strike was confirmed with the AME.
The first officer submitted that the aircraft was fully configured with autobrake
low and was stabilized at around 1800 Feet. At 1500 ft the autopilot was
disconnected and aircraft was flown manually. The aircraft stayed stabilized and
crossed runway threshold around 50 feet RA and a very light backward side
stick input was given to arrest the ROD slightly. On reaching 30 feet flare started
and retarded thrust levers. After retarding thrust levers he felt the aircraft was
sinking. To arrest ROD, he further pulled the side stick and nose went up ‘High’
caused the auto "PITCH PITCH" annunciation. After finishing parking checklist
and other paperwork when he went for external walk around, the tail strike was
noticed.
As per the Airbus report, the aircraft involved in the incident is fitted with the tail
strike prevention system. This modification introduces the tailstrike pitch limit
indicator on the PFD and the ‘PITCH PITCH’ annunciation to avoid tailstrike
during landing.
M/s Indigo has also reflected in its FCTM, the SOP for Pitch control while flaring
and touchdown the aircraft.
As per the FCTM, after touchdown, the flight crew should “fly” the nose wheel
without delay onto the runway and must be ready to counteract any residual
pitch up effect of the ground spoiler.
It is not recommended to keep the nose high in order to increase aircraft drag
during the initial part of the roll-out, as this technique is inefficient and increases
Page 20 of 27

the risk of tail strike. Furthermore, if auto brake MED is used, it may lead to a
hard nose gear touch down.
From the above discussion, application of ground spoiler also causes the pitch
up effect in addition to the side stick input.
1.19 USEFUL OR EFFECTIVE INVESTIGATION TECHNIQUES.
Nil.
2. ANALYSIS:
2.1. Technical Aspects: Aircraft had valid Certificate of Airworthiness. All the
mandatory modifications were complied with and the aircraft was
maintained as per the approved maintenance programme. The tailstrike
prevention system fitted on the aircraft introduced the tailstrike pitch limit
indicator on the PFD and the PITCH PITCH synthetic voice to avoid
tailstrike during landing.
The ARC was last renewed on 06.09.2022 which was valid till 05.09.2023.
On the day of incident after operating first flight of the day, the aircraft was
released under MEL. The invoked MEL has no contribution to the incident
of tail strike. On 03.01.2023, the MEL was revoked.
Page 21 of 27

The Suspected hard landing reported in the sector previous to the incident
flight had no effect on the aircraft performance. The vertical acceleration
recorded for suspected hard landing was well below the maximum vertical
acceleration defined by the manufacturer that requires maintenance
action. As per the PFR generated, no failure/damage was observed. As
per load report, the landing weight was within the limit. The aircraft
released for further flight.
From the above deliberations, it is evident that the technical aspect was
not the contributory factor to the incident.
2.2. Operational Aspects: PIC had sufficient flying experience to fly the
aircraft. He had flown various aircraft as PIC before joining M/s Indigo. He
had successfully completed the required trainings for endorsement of
A320 series aircraft on his ATPL as PIC. He was also cleared by the
operator to permit the FO for supervisory take-off landing (STOL) after due
assessment. He was involved in an incident of deviation from assigned
SID while operating an international flight with M/s Indigo although the
incident was not of similar type.
The FO officer had sufficient experience to operate A320 family aircraft as
First Officer and to perform the STOL. He underwent the required training
and the operator assessed him properly and imparted him additional
trainings based on his performance before releasing him as FO.
While operating the previous sector (from Kolkata to Dhaka), suspected
hard landing was reported. The PIC advised the FO to pull the side stick
slightly to arrest the ROD and to avoid the possibility of hard landing. For
the incident flight the PIC repeatedly advised the FO to pull the side stick
slightly while approaching for landing. Initially the FO gave very small pitch
up input. Later he started to increase the pitch-up input that resulted
reduction in ROD to 224ft/min at 10ft RA. After crossing 10ft of RA, he
suddenly increased the input to maximum at the time of touch down.
Application of ground spoiler while landing also caused the pitch up effect.
High pitch-up input alongwith application of ground spoiler caused the
pitch attitude of the aircraft increased to 10.7o after touchdown. This high
Page 22 of 27

pitch attitude caused tail strike of the aircraft. PITCH PITCH annunciation
came however, no input from the PIC has been observed throughout the
flight. The FO continued pitch-up input to its maximum limit even after
touchdown of Main Landing Gear. However, after the touchdown, lift
component reduced as per aerodynamic law due to decrease in ground
speed and the aircraft itself started to reduce its pitch. After landing, the
FO and PIC discussed the possibility of tail strike. Meanwhile, Cabin crew
informed the cockpit about the abnormal landing and loud sound heard
in the cabin.
The landing profile during flaring and touch down was not as per the FCTM
of the operator. The FCTM clearly mentions that, after touchdown, the
flight crew should “fly” the nose wheel without delay onto the
runway and must be ready to counteract any residual pitch up effect of
the ground spoiler.
It is not recommended to keep the nose high in order to increase aircraft
drag during the initial part of the roll-out, as this technique is inefficient
and increases the risk of tail strike.
The weather was normal throughout the approach and has no contribution
to the incident.
2.3. Factors Leading to Incident: From the above analysis, it is observed that
continued high pitch-up input by the FO along with pitch-up effect of the
ground spoiler, lack of monitoring by the PIC of high input by the FO with
low ROD and absence of any input by the PIC after PITCH PITCH
annunciation caused the sudden increase in pitch attitude of the aircraft
after the touchdown that resulted in the tail strike incident.
3. CONCLUSIONS:
3.1. FINDINGS:
1. Aircraft had valid Certificate of Airworthiness. All the applicable checks for
maintenance as per the approved schedule and mandatory modifications
were performed on the aircraft.
Page 23 of 27

SID on 23.09.2021 while operating an international flight with M/s Indigo.
8. The aircraft was cleared for ILS approach on RWY 01R.
9. Both crew were assessed and cleared by the operator for supervisory
take-off landing (STOL).
10. For the incident flight, the FO was the pilot flying (PF) to perform the
supervisory landing and the PIC was the pilot monitoring (PM).
11. In the previous sector, the FO was also the PF and he performed a
suspected hard landing. After landing, the PIC had advised the FO to keep
side stick pulled up slightly to arrest the ROD.
12. For the incident flight, the aircraft approach was normal till the touchdown.
13. The PIC asked the FO to pull the side stick slightly to keep the aircraft
nose slightly up.
14. Suddenly, the FO increased the pitch up input that caused reduction in
ROD to 224ft/min at 10ft of RA.
15. The PIC could not monitor the increase in pitch up input and decrease in
ROD. Even, he advised the FO to pull-up the side stick during landing.
16. The FO continued to increase the pitch-up input that reached to its
maximum limit at the time of touchdown.
17. High pitch up input caused the increase in pitch attitude of the aircraft after
landing.
18. Pitch angle after touchdown increased to 10.7o which led to the tail strike.
19. No input from the PIC side has been observed throughout the flight neither
in the previous sector nor in the incident flight even after PITCH PITCH
annunciation.
20. The FO continued high pitch-up input after touch down causing the delay
in nose wheel touching the runway.

21. Later the PIC pointed out that pitch input by FO was very high.
3.2 PROBABLE CAUSES:
Continuous high pitch-up input by the FO while landing causing the increase
in pitch attitude of the aircraft after touchdown attributed to the tail strike.
Lack of monitoring the flight parameters and no corrective input by PIC while
landing contributed to the incident.
4. SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS:
The action in view of findings on the part of crew as deemed fit may be taken.
