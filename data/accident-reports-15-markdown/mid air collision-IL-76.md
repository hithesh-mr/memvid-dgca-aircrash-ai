INQUIRY OF MID-AIR COLLISION BETWEEN SAUDI ARABIAN BOEING 747
AND KAZAKHSTAN IL-76 AIRCRAFT NEAR DELHI ON I 2TH NOVEMBER, 1996
A Saudi Arabian Boeing 747 aircraft and Kazakhastan IL-76 aircraft collided in mid-air
about 40 miles west of Delhi on 12th November, 1996. All the 312 occupants of Saudi Boeing
747 and 37 occupants of Kazakhstan IL-76 aircraft lost their lives. The Saudi Boeing 747 aircraft
was on a scheduled passenger flight from Delhi to Dahran and the Kazakhastan aircraft was
operating a non-scheduled flight from Chimkent, Kazakhastan to Delhi. After take off from
Delhi, Delhi Approach had instructed the Saudi Boeing 747 aircraft to climb and maintain FL-
140 (14,000 feet). The Kazakhastan aircraft had been instructed by Delhi Approach to descend
and maintain FL-150 (15,000 feet). Suddenly at 1840 hours the blips of the two aircraft
disappeared from the radar screen, as the two aircraft had collided. There was no casualty on
ground. The wreckage of Saudi Boeing 747 aircraft fell near village Dhani in Bhiwani District
of Haryana and that of Kazakhastan IL-76 aircraft was lying near village Birohar in Rohatak
District. Standing crops at the site of accident were damaged due to fire, impact and rescue
operations.
Government appointed Justice R.C. Lahoti, Judge High Court of Delhi to carry out a
formal investigation into the accident under Rule 75 of the Aircraft Rules, 1937.(cid:9) The
Government also appointed Capt. A.K. Verma, Director Air Safety, Air India and Air Cmde.

at Charkhi-Dadri, Haryana ( India)

CHAPTER - I
INTRODUCTION
(cid:9)
1.1 The worst air disaster in India and the third worst
in World aviation history took place on 12.11.96 at
about 1310 UTC (6.40PM IST) near Delhi.(cid:9) All 349
persons on board were killed when Kazakhstan IL-76
and Saudi Boeing-747 collided mid-air, 40 miles
west of the capital. There were 10 crew with 27
passengers on board KZ-1907 and 23 crew with 289
passengers on board SV-763.(cid:9) There were no
survivors.
1.2(cid:9) Kazak aircraft had departed from Chimkent Airport
(Kazakhstan) at 10.25 UTC on 12.11.96 for Delhi.
It was on a non-scheduled flight supposed to carry
tourists to India.(cid:9) Delhi Approach had instructed
it to maintain Flight Level 150 (15000 ft).
1.3(cid:9) Saudi aircraft was on a scheduled passenger flight.
It had arrived at Delhi from Jeddah (Saudi Arabia)
and was on its return flight to Dhahran (Saudi
Arabia).(cid:9) The aircraft departed Delhi Airport at
1303 UTC (6:33 PM IST) from Runway 28 and was
cleared via ATS Route G452.(cid:9) Prior to the
5

collision, Delhi Approach had instructed it to
maintain Flight Level 140 (14,000 ft).(cid:9) Suddenly,
the two radar blips disappeared from Controller's
Screen and his worst fears were soon confirmed. The
two aircraft had collided !
A USAF aircraft was on a flight from Islamabad to
Delhi via Hissar.(cid:9) It had started descent into
Delhi terminal area around 15 minutes prior to the
unfortunate accident. It was somewhere between FL
200 and FL 140 (estimated) and was in Visual
Meteorological Conditions (VMC) when the pilot saw
a cloud lit up with an orange glow at 2 O'clock
position from his aircraft. At first he thought it
was lightening, but when the glow persisted the
lightening was ruled out.(cid:9) As he descended his
aircraft near the base of the cloud he saw two
fireballs diverging away from each other which then
proceeded to hit the ground.(cid:9) The pilot called
Delhi Approach and communicated - " We saw
something to our right, looks like a big fireball
something--- looks like a big explosion."(cid:9) He
continued,"We see two fires trying to break to our
right about 44 miles to your north west" and soon
thereafter " passing through, we saw a big fireball
in the cloud and I saw fire debris; Two distinct
6

(cid:9)(cid:9)
fires on the ground". Soon the Radar Controller at
Delhi ATC realised that a mid-air collision had
taken place.
1.5(cid:9) According to the villagers who happened to witness
the collision, "there was at first an earth
shattering sound which shook the entire village.
The doors and windows of the houses were shattered
and glass panes were strewn all around. Frightened
families, believing it to be an earthquake, came
out of their houses.(cid:9) A huge ball of fire had
engulfed the sky and then the two planes fell off
in different directions to turn into debris and
burnt dead bodies, all scattered in an area of a
few kilometers in the fields".
1.6(cid:9) The officials of Civil Aviation Department, the
local administration and the police, all swung into
action. BBC and CNN were the first to flash the
'stop -telecast'news. There was panic all around.
Heart-rending scenes were witnessed as friends and
relatives, who had seen off the passengers of the
ill-fated Saudi aircraft just a couple of hours
earlier, started making frantic enquiries. At the
site approximately 20,000 people had gathered which
7

(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)
hampered rescue operations and gave police a tough
time.
1.7(cid:9) The DGCA took cognizance(cid:9) of the accident and
immediately appointed Capt KPS Nair, Dy Director,
Flight Crew Standards, to act as Inspector of
Accident, to carry out investigation under Rule 71
of the Aircraft Rules, 1937.
1.8(cid:9) Such was the gravity of the calamity that the Union
Cabinet met under the Chairmanship of the then
Prime Minister Shri HD Deve Gowda to take stock of
the situation. The Hon'ble Prime Minister of India,
accompanied by Shri Bansi Lal, the Chief Minister
of Haryana, visited the site of the accident. The
Prime Minister announced holding of a judicial
inquiry by a sitting High Court Judge.
(cid:9)
1.9 The whole world was shocked and the nation was
stunned at such a colossal loss of human life and
property besides destruction of the two aircraft.
1.10(cid:9) On the morning of 14.11.96 Shri H.S. Khola, the
Director General of Civil Aviation, contacted me
and sought an appointment to hold a briefing about
8

(cid:9)(cid:9)
the progress of the investigation carried out by
(cid:9)
the Inspector of Accident. Shri(cid:9) Khola
accompanied by Shri Satender Singh, Dy DGCA, Capt.
KPS Nair and Shri V.K.Arora, Controller of Airwor-
thiness (appointed as Secretary to the Court of
Inquiry) met me in my chambers in Delhi High Court
and briefed me on the progress of investigation
carried out till then.(cid:9) It was reported that the
Inspector of Accident was carrying out the
investigation and ensuring that the necessary
factual information and evidence were gathered at
the earliest and measures were taken to see that no
evidence was lost prior to taking over of the
inquiry by the Court.(cid:9) The DGCA officers and
Inspector of Accident were advised to continue with
the investigation and to keep the Court informed of
the progress made from time to time and to comply
with the directions issued by the Court.
1.11(cid:9) On 15.11.1996 the Central Government issued
notification announcing formal investigation and
constitution of the Court of Inquiry under Rule 75
of Aircraft Rules,1937.
1.12(cid:9) On 16.11.1996, I, accompanied by Air Cmde (Retd) T.
9

Pannu, Ex-Director Operations (ATC), IAF (appointed
as assessor), Shri Khola DGCA, Capt Nair, Inspector
of Accident, Shri Satender Singh, Dy DGCA and Shri
V.K.Arora, Secretary to the Court, went by surface
transport to Charkhi Dadri.(cid:9) Shri GB Kumar,
Commisioner Hissar, Shri Sheokand, Distt.
Commissioner Bhiwani and Shri A. Akil, Supdt of
Police, Bhiwani also joined the members of the
Court.
1.13(cid:9) The wreckage of the aircraft was lying in two
different areas : one, near Charkhi Dadri within
the jurisdiction of Bhiwani District, and the
other, within the limits of Rohtak District. The
Court first visited the wreckage site near Charkhi
Dadri. Most of the wreckage of the Saudi aircraft
was lying in this area. The District authorities
informed the Court about the post accident action
taken by them and also about the disposal of the
dead bodies. The District authorities desired to
know future plans about securing the wreckage. The
Court instructed that since the wreckage
examination was in progress and not yet completed,
it should be protected in "as is where is"
condition and necessary help should be given to the
10

Inspector of Accident and his team in the
examination of the wreckage and retrieval of the
parts for investigation.(cid:9) The Court gave
instructions to the local authorities and the
Director of Air Safety to dig the area where the
nose of the Saudi aircraft had impacted to retrieve
the cockpit instruments, particularly the
altimeters. In the afternoon the Court visited the
other site of wreckage in Rohtak District.(cid:9) The
District Commissioner, Rohtak, Mr.Prasad, and other
district officials also joined the Court during the
inspection. At this site most of the wreckage of
the Kazak aircraft was lying.(cid:9) This wreckage,
particularly the front portion of the IL-76
aircraft, was in a fairly intact condition. Shri
V.K. Chandana, the Director of Air Safety, DGCA,
along with his team and representatives of Kazak
Airlines, was working at the site. They had re-
trieved four altimeters from the wreckage of the
Kazak aircraft. The Court inspected the articles.
Readings of the altimeters and their physical
condition were noted and photographed. Wreckage
pattern was inspected. Rohtak District authorities
were also instructed to preserve the wreckage in
"as is where is" condition till the examination was
11

(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)
concluded.
1.14(cid:9) It appears that the local police had registered an
offence under Sections 304 A, 337,279 of Indian
Penal Code in respect of the accident.(cid:9) On a
request made on behalf of the Embassy of Republic
of Kazakhstan and Rohtak District Administration,
the Court issued on the spot a "no objection" to
personal belongings of the passengers of Kazak
aircraft IL-76 (seized by the police) being
released. However, the passports, licences, flight
identity cards, currency declaration books and
other documents which accompany the crew on board
the aircraft, were directed not to be released as
the same might be required for investigation
purposes.
1.15(cid:9) On 18.11.1996,(cid:9) on behalf of the Court, the
assessor Air Cmde T. Pannu visited the site so as
to take 'on the spot' stock of the investigation in
progress and to issue suitable instructions, if
necessary.
1.16(cid:9) On information being received that the cockpit of
the Saudi Arabian aircraft had been dug out, the
12

Court accompanied by the Assessors Air Cmde T.
Pannu and Capt. A.K. Verma as also the Inspector of
Accident visited the site of the accident(cid:9) on
25.11.1996. Shri V.K.Chandana and Shri A. Akil,
Capt Mohd IA Khan, representative of(cid:9) Saudi
Government, and an Engineering representative of
the Saudi Arabian Airlines were present at the
site. Capt Ommar S. Barayyan from Presidency of
Civil Aviation, Saudi Arabia and Shri B.U. Salimov,
Acting DGCA Kazakhstan, respectively designated as
the Accredited Representatives of the two States
were also present at the site.
1.17(cid:9) The cockpit of Saudi aircraft was completely
smashed.(cid:9) On account of impact of the crash the
instruments in the cockpit had been badly crushed.
They had also been destroyed by fire. No instrument
or part of cockpit was in a shape so as to be of
any use in the investigation. Nothing could be
identified as the altimeters belonging to the
Saudi aircraft.
1.18(cid:9) The Court and the Assessors inspected the main
portion of the wreckage of Saudi aircraft and the
crater which was dug to retrieve cockpit
13

(cid:9)(cid:9)
instruments etc. After consulting the Accredited
Representatives, the SP Bhiwani and the Director of
Air Safety, it was concluded that further search
for recovering the Saudi altimeters and cockpit
instruments was not likely to yield any result. As
such, further search in that direction was directed
to be called off. The Court also visited the
wreckage site of Kazak aircraft in Rohtak District
and took stock of the security arrangements.
All the wreckage was being adequately guarded by
1.19(cid:9)
the police and local administration. Main sites
were cordoned off. Though the local authorities at
both the sites were requesting for disposal of
wreckage, they were advised to wait till further
directions.
Fortunately, the black boxes of both the ill-fated
1.20(cid:9)
aircraft were retrieved from the site of the
Cockpit Voice Recorder and Digital
accident.(cid:9)
Flight Data Recorder of Saudi aircraft as also the
Cockpit Voice Recorder and Flight Data Recorder of
Kazak aircraft had been found.(cid:9) They were
apparently intact and undamaged except for some
superficial scratches on the casings. They were
14

inspected by the members of the Court at the site.
1.21(cid:9) The two sets of black boxes and the four altimeters
of Kazak aircraft were sealed and consigned to safe
custody of Inspector of Accident.

Factual Information
Report of Court of Inquiry on Mid-Air Collision on 12-11-1996
between Saudi Arabian HBoeing 747 & Kazak IL-76
at Charkhi-Dadri, Haryana ( India)

CHAPTER II
FACTUAL INFORMATION
2.1(cid:9) History of Kazak Flight KZ-1907
2.1.1(cid:9) Kazakhstan IL-76 aircraft _ departed from
Chimkent
(Kazakhstan) on 12.11.1996 at 10:25 UTC operating
Flight Kazak 1907 to Delhi Airport with 37 persons
including 10 crew members on board. The aircraft
IL-76 was owned by SHYMKENT AVIA of Kazakhstan and
was on a non-scheduled flight carrying tourists
from Kazakhstan to India.
2.1.2(cid:9) The IL-76 aircraft was under the command of
Capt. Alexander Robertovich Cherepanov along with
Co-Pilot, Flight Engineer, Flight Navigator and
Radio Operator as flight crew members.
2.1.3(cid:9) A flight plan was filed at Chimkent before
departure and the same was received by the Air
Traffic Services of IGI Airport, Delhi before
Kazak-1907 came in contact on VHF. The flight plan
indicated Estimated Time of Departure (ETD)
CHIMKENT 1030 hours, flight level 330, entry India
16

at 'Tiger' on route G-452 and flying time to Delhi
as 3 hours 10 minutes. The flight, with alternate
aerodromes as Bombay and Ahmedabad, had uplifted 62
tonnes of fuel at Chimkent.
2.1.4(cid:9) Kazak 1907 initially came in contact with Delhi Radio
(HF) at 1100 hours when it reported maintaining flight
level 330 and estimated 'Tiger' at 1243 hours and gave
Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) Delhi as 1323 hours.
2.1.5.(cid:9) The aircraft contacted Delhi Control on Very High
Frequency (VHF) 124.55 MHz at 1253 hours, maintaining
flight level 330 at position LUNKA.(cid:9) LUNKA is a
reporting point on radial 270 from Delhi on
international route G-452 and is 177 miles west of
Delhi.(cid:9) Subsequently at 1254 hours, the aircraft
reported at 168 miles DME from Delhi VOR.
2.1.6(cid:9) The aircraft was initially cleared by Area Control
(West) of Delhi ATC to descend to flight level 250 at
1258 hours and subsequently, at 1303, it was cleared to
descend to flight level 180 and was asked to report
passing flight level 200. While passing flight level
240, at 1305 hours, the aircraft was asked to change
over to Delhi Approach on frequency 127.9 MHz.
2.1.7(cid:9) At 1305 hours, KZ-1907 contacted Delhi Approach and
17

reported passing flight level 230 at 74 miles from
Delhi VOR. Delhi Approach further cleared the aircraft
to descend to flight level 150 with the instructions to
report reaching level 150. At 1310 hours, in reply to
a query from Approach, Kazak 1907 reported reaching
flight level 150 on radial 270.(cid:9) At this time, the
aircraft was identified by Radar and advised to
maintain Flight Level 150.(cid:9) Traffic information on
reciprocal Saudi B-747 aircraft "12(cid:9) O'Clock at 10
miles likely to cross in another 5 miles" was also
passed at this time. Kazak 1907 acknowledged the same
and asked for the distance of the traffic again. To
this, Approach replied "traffic is at 8 miles now FL
140." Kazak 1907 acknowledged the distance information
of traffic at 8 miles and said that they were looking
for the traffic. This was the last transmission from
Kazak IL-76 aircraft to Delhi ATC.
2.2(cid:9) History of Saudi Flight SV-763
2.2.1(cid:9) Saudi Airlines B-747 aircraft, callsign SV-763 departed
from Delhi for Dhahran at 1303 hrs. with 312 persons on
board including 23 crew members.(cid:9) The aircraft was
owned by Saudi Arabian Airlines.(cid:9) It had arrived
earlier from Jeddah and this was a return flight from
Delhi for Saudi Arabia.
18

(cid:9)(cid:9)
2.2.2(cid:9) The flight plan of SV-763 flight filed with Delhi ATC
gave Estimated Time of Departure Delhi as 1245 hours,
flight level 350 on route G-452 to Dhahran with B-747
aircraft under the command of Capt. Shubaily.
2.2.3(cid:9) The aircraft departed at 1303 hours from Runway 28 of
Delhi airport.(cid:9) It was cleared to Dhahran via G-452,
Flight Level 350, Departure PARVI-1, initially Flight
Level 260, request level change enroute.
2.2.4(cid:9) After airborne, Saudi SV-763 contacted Delhi Approach
on frequency 127.9 MHz. Delhi Approach indentified SV-
763 on Radar and cleared the aircraft to climb to
flight level 100 initially and advised it to standby
for higher level. Subsequently at 13:07 hours, SV-763
reported approaching flight level 100 and Approach
Radar cleared the aircraft to climb to flight level
140. At 1309 hours, SV-763 reported approaching flight
level 140 and requested for higher level. In reply to
this, Approach Radar instructed SV-763 to maintain
flight level 140 and standby for higher.(cid:9) SV-763
acknowledged the same transmitting "Saudi 763 (will)
maintain one four zero."
19

(cid:9)(cid:9)
2.2.5(cid:9) Saudi SV-763 was following G-452 route which is on
radial 270 from Delhi VOR and as such was reciprocal to
the arriving Kazak-1907 flight.(cid:9) At 1311 hours the
following transmission in Arabic language was found
recorded on the ATC tape.(cid:9) "Astaghfor Allah, Ashhau
Unlealaha Ella Allah".(cid:9) According to the Saudi
Representatives, this transmission was from their
aircraft and the English translation of the same is
"God Forgiveness, I witness no other God but Allah".
Thereafter, there was no transmission from Saudi
Aircraft.
2.2.6(cid:9) Meanwhile, the Approach Controller lost radar contact
with SV-763 and Kazak-1907. At 1312 hours, a U.S. Air
Force aircraft, Call Sign M-1815, on flight from
Islamabad to Delhi via Hissar, reported to Delhi
Approach, sighting a big fireball followed by two
distinct fires on the ground.(cid:9) This aircraft was
estimating to arrive Delhi at 1320 hours, on route
Amber 466 and was flying north of route G-452. The
U.S. Air Force aircraft, at that time was flying
approximately 15 miles North of the point where the
radar blips of Saudi SV-763 and Kazak-1907 disappeared
from the radar screen. The aircraft reported to the
Approach Controller, "We saw something to our right
20

looks like a big fire ball (cid:9) looks like a big
explosion".(cid:9) Immediately upon receipt of this
information from the U.S. Air Force aircraft, the
Approach Controller gave repeated calls to the Kazak
aircraft and also to Saudi aircraft but there was no
response.(cid:9) The US aircraft further reported at 1313
hours "we see two fires trying to break to our right
about four four miles to your North-West at this time".
On a query from Approach Control, the aircraft further
replied, "passing thr:ugh, we saw a big fire ball in
the cloud and I saw fire debris. Two distinct fires on
the ground, over". The Controller apprised the Watch
Supervisory Officer of the above and consequently
rescue action was initiated.
Subsequently, it was confirmed through ground reports
from the district authorities of Bhiwani and Rohtak
(Haryana) that the wreckage of both the aircraft had
been sighted and was spread out in an area of 5-6 kms.
Further it was confirmed that both the aircraft had
been destroyed due to fire and impact.(cid:9) It was also
reported that, perhaps, there were no survivors from
either of the flights.
2.2.7(cid:9)
The wreckage of the Saudi B-747 aircraft fell near
village Dhani-Phogat(cid:9) Bhiwani Distt. of Haryana and
21

was on fire even when the villagers and rescue team of
the civil authorities and Airports Authority reached
the site. Bodies were spread around in the fields and
also trapped in the debris which were extricated by the
local authorities.

39

2.14.1(cid:9) Aerodrome Control
The aerodrome control is located in the glass room on
top of the control tower building with unobstructed
viewing facility of the entire aerodrome in good
visibility conditions. The aerodrome control has three
duty officers at a time.
i. Duty Officer SMC.
ii. Duty Officer Aerodrome Control.
iii. Duty Officer ATIS.
The Duty Officers are rated Controllers and control the
traffic in the vicinity of the aerodrome. Aerodrome
Control communicates with aircraft on frequency 118.1
MHz. The SurfaceMovement Control operates on frequency
121.9 MHz.
The Duty Officer Aerodrome Terminal Inf ormation Service
(ATIS) is responsible for the broadcast of Aeronautical
Terminal Information Service provided on VHF 126.4 MHz
located at the Control Tower.
The aerodrome controller is also required to coordinate
with approach controller on intercom provided between
them.
The departing aircraft is issued with ATC clearance
before take-off, by aerodrome control, after
coordination with the Approach Control/Area Control.
Before take-off, the departure clearance is also issued
by the Aerodrome Control after coordination with
approach controller for separating traffic in its area
of responsibility.
The aerodrome controller hands Over the departing
aircraft after it is airborne to approach control and
clear of traffic within its jurisdiction.
The aerodrome controller takes over the control of
arriving aircraft within its vicinity in visual
meteorological conditions or as coordinated with
approach control/radar during the course of instrument
approach to land in IMC.
The aerodrome control tower also houses a qualified Met.
observer who, with the help of the instruments provided
in the tower, gives the current weather observations.
40

2.14.2(cid:9) Approach Control

2.15(cid:9) Altimeter Setting Procedures in Indian Airspace
The Aeronautical Information Publication (AIP) lays
down the altimeter setting procedure for aircraft
flying in the air space. Accordingly,
41

(a) Transition altitude is specified for each
aerodrome and no transition altitude is less than 4000
feet.
(b)(cid:9) Vertical positioning of aircraft when at or below
transition altitude is expressed in terms of altitude
whereas such positioning at or above the transition
level is expressed in terms of flight levels.(cid:9) While
passing through the transition layer, vertical
positioning is expressed in terms of altitude when
descending and in terms of flight level when ascending.
(c)(cid:9) Flight level 'zero' is located at the atmospheric
pressure level of 1013.2 HPa (29.92 inches).
Consecutive flight levels are separated by pressure
interval corresponding to 500 feet in standard
atmosphere.
(d)(cid:9) For take-off and climb,
(i) the QNH altimeter setting is made avail-
able to the aircraft in taxi clearance
prior to take-off.
(ii) vertical positioning of aircraft during
climb is expressed in terms of altitudes
until reaching transition altitude above
which vertical positioning is expressed
in terms of flight levels.
(e)(cid:9) Vertical separation enroute :
Vertical separation during enroute flight
shall be expressed in terms of flight levels
at all times. Except when flying in the
vicinity of aerodrome at or below transition
altitude
(f)(cid:9) Approach and Landing :
(i) A QNH altimeter setting is made available in
the routine approach and landing
instructions. The altimeter setting obtained
on radio telephone shall be read back to the
ATS Unit.
42

(ii) vertical positioning of the aircraft during
approach is controlled by reference to flight
levels until reaching the transition level
below which vertical positioning is control-
led by reference to altitudes".

2.23.3(cid:9) Wreckage Details of Saudi B-747 Aircraft
Saudi aircraft wreckage was spread in a trail of 3 kms.
in length and 2 kms. width near village Dhani Phogat in
Bhiwani Distt. of Haryana. The wreckage trail was from
East to West and it started with the bigger pieces of
detached fan blades of the No. 1 and 2 engine and the
detached portion of horizontal stabiliser without its
left tip portion. Most of the wreckage scatter was that
of the rear fuselage and of tail portion. While at the
main crash site i.e. on western side, the fuselage
portion along with both the wings and landing gears had
nose dived and caught extensive fire, No. 3 and 4 engines
had sheared off in air and were found embedded in the
ground. Portion of No. 1 engine was also found at the
main crash site.(cid:9) The cockpit portion was also buried
inside the ground and was excavated with the help of
machines. Number of components of the cockpit area were
retrieved, however, these were in burnt and mutilated
condition and no useful evidence could be obtained in the
cockpit wreckage. One broken nose cowl of one of the
port engine was found at the beginning of the Kazak
wreckage trail. The left side of horizontal stabiliser
around 18 feet which had broken off as a result of impact
with the Kazak aircraft was found lying about 400 meters
from the beginning of the trail near Patuwas village.
Following are the observations on the different portions
of the wreckage :
Main Crash Site
At main crash site, both the burnt wings could be seen
along with broken undercarriage structure and wheels.
There were signs of extensive fire. One engine portion
was found on the left side which was identified as
portions of No. 1 engine. Little behind the main crash
site, the scatter of the fuselage, seats and cargo
54

compartment along with the cargo containers were found.
Engines
No. 3 and 4 engines were close to the main crash site.
No. 3 engine along with its cowling and pylon was lying
close to the railway line which is 750 meters behind the
main crash site.(cid:9) No. il engine along with cowling had
dug in ground 250 meters behind the main crash site. A
portion of one of the nose cowlings was found lying at
the beginning of Kazak wreckage trail.(cid:9) The fan
assemblies of both the port engines which had detached
in air from its engines were found lying in the
'
beginning of the trail on its left side on the outskirts
of village Patuwas.(cid:9) Core portion of one of the port
engines was lying in a wreckage trail behind the railway
line in village Patuwas.(cid:9) The wreckage scatter of the
broken engine pieces of the port engines indicates their
break up in air.(cid:9) The fan blades of the port engines
indicated that the engines were at power at the time of
their break up.
Tail Portion
Horizontal stabiliser with its left side tip
a)
portion of about 18 feet length chopped off was
found lying in the beginning of the wreckage trail
at about 1.26 kms behind the main wreckage. The
actuator of the stabiliser was found detached from
the structure. The cut out portion of the left
side of horizontal stabiliser of about 18 feet was
found lying on left side of the wreckage trail
near Patuwas village around 2.4 kms behind the
main crash site. The direction of cut of the left
side of horizontal stabiliser appear to be paral-
lel to the longitudinal axis.
The fin and the rudder were found detached in the
b)
wreckage scatter at about 1.5 kms behind the main
wreckage.
Fuselage
Rear fuselage had broken into number of pieces and
a)(cid:9)
was found scattered upto the main crash site.
55

b)(cid:9) The front portion of fuselage along with the wings
was completely destroyed as a result of impact and
fire damage.
2.23.4(cid:9) Indications from the Wreckage Pattern
The presence of Saudi engine sliced nose cowl in the
beginning of Kazak wreckage, in-flight break up of fan
assemblies of Saudi aircraft port engines, and slicing of
port wing of Kazakhstan aircraft at two places are
indicative of the hit of port wing of Kazakhstan aircraft
with the port engines of saudia aircraft as a first
impact between the two aircraft.(cid:9) The cut on the left
side of the horizontal stabiliser of Saudi aircraft and
chopping of horizontal stabiliser from the 'T' tail of
Kazakhstan aircraft appear to be subsequent to the first
impact.
2.24(cid:9) Medical and Pathological Information
Dead- bodies of crew and passengers of Kazak aircraft
were transported to the Rohtak Medical College Hospital.
Bodies were mutilated and charred.(cid:9) Post mortem on
bodies was 'carried out at Rohtak Medical College in the
presence of the Asstt. Director General, Medical
Services of DGCA.
2.24.1(cid:9) Following tissues of the remains of Capt. Cherepanov, PIC
and Mr. Chuprouv, flight engineer of Kazak Airlines were
sent to Institute of Aerospace Medicine (IAM), Air Force,
Bangalore for histopathological examination :
(i) Both lungs
(ii) A part of trachea
(iii)Heart - ruptured
(iv) A portion of aorta
(v) Both Kidneys
(vi) Adrenals
From the reports of the pathologist of IAM on
microscopic and toxicological/biochemical investigation,
the following observations are noted :
56

2.24.2(cid:9) Capt. Cherepanpv, PIC
(1)(cid:9) Traumatic pneumonosis appears to be due to air-
craft crash impact forces.
(ii) Mason's grade 1+ atheromatous change in a pre-
existing disease. It is an incidental finding and
appears to be non-contributory to the accident
causation.
(iii) There is no evidence of carbon monooxide poison-
ing or alcohol consumption.
iv)(cid:9) Lactic acid level is within normal limits indicat-
ing no evidence of hypoxia.
2.24.3(cid:9) Mr. Chuprouv, Flight Engineer
(i) Corpora amylacea in the lung is an incidental
finding and non-contributory to the accident
causation.
(ii) There is no evidence of carbon monoxide poisoning.
(iii) Histopathologically, all tissues examined appear
normal.
The comments of Wg. Cdr. R. Kapur, Asstt. Director
General Medical Services, DGCA, in this regard, are
given below :
"The post mortem examination conducted on the
body of pilot of Kazak aircraft Capt. Chere-
panov revealed no evidence of incapacitation,
carbon monoxide, hypoxia or any pre-exist
ing disease which may have contributed to the
accident.(cid:9) No evidence of alcohol was found
in the body contents.
The post mortem report on other occupants of
Kazakhstan aircraft reveals multiple fractures and
injuries suggestive of crash forces which were
beyond survivable limits".
57

2.25(cid:9) Fire
Both the aircraft appear to have caught fire immediately
upon collision.(cid:9) This is evident from the eyewitness
statements and from the statement of the U.S. Air Force
aircraft crew recorded on frequency 127.9 MHz.(cid:9) Some
wreckage pieces lying on ground had fire marks without
continuity of fire trail between them.(cid:9) This indicates
that these pieces were on fire when impacted the ground.
The main fuselage. of Saudi B-747 aircraft was destroyed
due to impact and fire.
The main fuselage of Kazak IL-76 aircraft caught fire and
fell a few hundred feet away from the front fuselage
portion along with cockpit which got separated.(cid:9) While
the main fuselage got engulfed in fire, the front portion
was severely damaged due to impact.
At Saudi accident site, fire tenders from the local fire
stations were put into service to extinguish the fire.
At Kazak accident site, fire had ceased when the fire
tenders reached the site and so were not put to use.
2.26(cid:9) Survival Aspects
Both the aircraft disintegrated after the mid-air
collision. All the occupants on board both the aircraft
died due to fire and impact on ground.
Rescue action was immediately initiated and a team of
local police authorities and villagers reached the site
soon after the accident.
According to Shri Robey Lal, Member (Operations),
Airports Authority of India, two teams of officials
including doctors and ambulances with emergency medical
supplies departed for the site immediately upon receipt
of the information about the accident. One of the teams
went to the Kazak site and the other team proceeded to
the site of Saudi accident.(cid:9) They reached the site at
2350 hours (IST). According to him, at the Saudi site,
there were large number of police deployed and they were
being helped by many local residents of the surrounding
villages for recovering the bodies.(cid:9) The bodies were
removed under police control to a temporary morgue set up
58

at the Government Hospital, Dadri.(cid:9) Though there were
rumours of 2 to 3 survivors, he further stated that as
per the Supdt. of Police, there were none and so, Medical
Assistance was not found necessary. He also confirmed
that local fire tenders and ambulances were on site.
According to Shri Robey Lal, the team which proceeded to
the Kazak crash site informed that there were also no
survivors and there had been no requirement for any
medical assistance at that site also.
As per the documents forwarded by Dr. C.M. Sharma,
Senior Medical Officer of the Airports Authority of
India, Dr. B. Bhatnagar rushed in Airports Authority
Ambulance along with Dr. Chawla and Dr. P. Arora at
Charkhi Dadri accident site.(cid:9) There were no survivors
found but only badly mutilated bodies.
According to Dr. (Mrs.) P. Arora, All India Institute of
Medical Sciences, Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital and the
Army Hospitals were alerted to receive possible
casualities. Further, she stated that she reached Kazak
accident site near village Birohar in District Rohtak
and found no survivors.(cid:9) She along with her team
witnessed the bodies smashed in wreckage and few
scattered around.(cid:9) According to her, the Red Cross
Ambulance was also seen at the site.
According to Shri Robey Lal, the Emergency Control Room
at International Airports Division was set up under the
supervision of Deputy General Manager (Operations) for
answering queries.(cid:9) Further information counters were
set up at the Departure Terminal II for answering
queries of relatives and friends of the passengers of
the aircraft.
According to District Authorities of Rohtak where the
wreckage of Kazak IL-76 fell, two reserve each from
Sonepat, Panipat and three reserve each from Rohtak,
Jhajhar, Beay and Saldhewas under the supervision of two
District Supdt. of Police, were deployed.
Eight doctors and three nurses were called from Red
Cross.With the help of police, 37 dead bodies were
recovered and post mortem was conducted at Medical
College, Rohtak.(cid:9) Subsequent)), the bodies were handed
over to the representatives of the airline through the

3.3(cid:9) Chapter 1 of DOC 6920-AN/855/4 (Manual of Aircraft
Accident Investigation) approved by and published under
the authority of International Civil Aviation Organisa-
tion (ICAO) provides as under :
PURPOSE OF THE INQUIRY
The fundamental purpose of inquiry into an
aircraft accident is to determine the facts, condi-
tions and circumstances pertaining to the accident
with a view to establishing the probable cause there-
of, so that appropriate steps may be taken to prevent
a recurrence of the accident and the factors which led
to it. An equally important purpose is to determine
the facts, conditions and circumstances pertaining to
the survival or non-survival, of the occupants, and
the crashworthiness of the aircraft. The nature of
the inquiry into an aircraft accident should not be
accusatory as the object is to take remedial rather
than punitive action; similarly the assessment of
blame or responsibility should not be included in the
duties of an aircraft accident investigation authority
since this function is normally the prerogative of the
judicial authorities of the State concerned. Never-
theless, it is unavoidable that acts or omissions, by
62

individual persons or organizations, are sometimes
clearly revealed and in such instances it is the duty
of the inquiry to say so. Any such statement should
not confuse the purpose of the aircraft accident
investigation which is primarily to indicate what
onumnd Ihn nooldnot !allow Ihno who onmitul l[ : thin
should rightly be for others to decide.
Anpecis of safety totally unconnected with the
circumstances or chain of events leading to the accid-
ent are often revealed during the investigation with a
resultant benefit in terms of effective accident
prevention.(cid:9) Investigators should not be inhibited
from investigating these matters or from drawing
attention to them merely because they are not related
to the cause of the accident.
Reduced to simple terms, the investigator has to
determine what happened, how it happened, and why it
happened, applying these questions not only to basic
cause but to all aspects relating to safety including
survival of occupants. In doing this he must seek
out, record and analyse the facts, draw conclusions
and, where appropriate, make recommendations.
The basic cause of an accident and the remedial action
necessary to ensure that it will not recur does not
always emerge from the physical facts of the case.
For example, a failure of some mechanical part may be
due to a failure to inspect or faulty inspection
technique in a factory or a maintenance shop where the
defective part should have been detected thereby
preventing its failure in service.(cid:9) Similarly, if
human error appears as a possible cause of the accid-
ent all factors which may have influenced the actions
should be examined. The inquiry should not cease if
or when it is established an error has been made : the
inquiry should endeavour to establish why the error
occurred. Poor design, indifferent human engineering,
inadequate or improper operational procedures could
well have confused or misled the person. Experience
has shown that the majority of aircraft accidents have
been caused or compounded by human error, often by
circumstances which were conducive to human error;
this applies to design, manufacture, testing, main-
tenance, inspection and operational procedures both
ground and air.(cid:9) Identification of this element is
frequently difficult but it may be revealed by care-
ful, skillful and persistent investigative methods.
63

Same aircraft accidents have resulted fran
organizational defects or weaknesses in management;
for example, an operator may have prescribed or con-
doned procedure not commensurate with safe operating
conditions in practice. Similarly, ambiguous instruc-
tions, and those capable of dual interpretation may
also have existed; these factors may well have stemmed
in the first instance fram uncritical scrutiny by
regulating authorities. It may therefore be necessary
to inquire closely into other organizations or agen-
cies not immediately or directly concerned with the
circumstances of the accident but where action, or
lack of it, may have permitted or even caused the
accident to happen.
WHERE the cause of an accident is obscure it may
be necessary to pursue as many hypotheses as could
seriously be regarded as possibilities and each
pursued to the limits of its usefulness, or to the
limit where it can be excluded as a possibility. This
approach will often result in some degree of specula-
tion and prolonged exploration but it may be the only
course open to the investigator. By carefully consid-
ering each possibility in the light of the evidence
adduced, and the existing state of aeronautical knowl-
edge, a number of the hypotheses will be eliminated:
the credibility of those which survive the process is
thereby increased and experience has shown that these
will generally relate to one particular area or group
of possibilities.
Findings which have been arrived at by more than
one line of inquiry, by more than one person each
reasoning independently, are more likely to be correct
than those conclusions arrived at by pursuing one
narrow field of activity.
3.4(cid:9) There are no set rules or procedure laid down. The
court of Inquiry is not bound by rules of evidence.
However, the court has to observe and comply with the
principles of natural justice. It has to so conduct
itself as to facilitate influx from all and any
64

source of any material which would be useful to it
for investigation of the accident. At the same time
it has to be fair to all concerned. The participants
and the observers must be afforded opportunity of
participating and observing respectively. Any one
interested or likely to be effected by the Court of
Inquiry proceedings, its findings, conclusions,
observations and recommendations, must be afforded an
opportunity of hearing.(cid:9) Laying down of any set
procedure appears to have been consciously avoided.
It is obvious that the manner and th'e circumstances
in which an accident may take place are myriad and
defy imagination. It has to be left to the wisdom and
experience of the court entrusted with the formal
investigation to appropriately devise its procedure
so as to suit the exigencies of the situation and
demands of the circumstances of each individual
accident/incident; the paramount consideration being
to ascertain the causes and circumstances of the
accident. The object is not to find fault with any
one much less to fix the liability for the accident.
The object is ideal and humanitarian. A court has to
make its recommendations and observations in the
interest of humanity, safety of persons and property
so that such accidents do not recur in future. The
65

object of investigation being one to which none can
raise an exception, the Court can justifiably expect
each one concerned rendering his wholehearted
cooperation and assistance enabling it to perform its
function and achieve the objective successfully,
fruitfully and expeditiously. There are no
adversaries before such a court.
3.5(cid:9) In the proceedings the court has, therefore, from the
very beginning maintained complete transparency.
Participation by all concerned was invited at every
stage of the proceedings.(cid:9) This would be evident
from the record of the proceedings, also reflected by
the narration of relevant events and proceedings
contained in the report. Such procedure did bring
out the desired result. At every crucial stage of
proceedings the parties could raise their
contentions, put forth their objections and make
suggestions which were all considered then and there
and dealt with suitably. All the material
constituting(cid:9) evidence in the investigation was
collected in the presence of the parties. It was
acceptable to them as evidence. At the hearing, all
the parties agreed to the material collected by the
court being read as evidence and made use of by the
66

(cid:9)(cid:9)
Court dispensing with the necessity of recording
evidence either viva-voce or on affidavits.
Obviously, none insisted on exercising right of
cross-examination, nay none even felt its need. All
the(cid:9) documents(cid:9) were(cid:9) therefore(cid:9) marked(cid:9) as
exhibits/articles with the consent of the parties.
Substantial time, energy and expenditure which
would have been consumed and involved in recording
the statements of the witnesses (some of whom were
bound to be from foreign countries), could be saved.
The parties made their submissions- oral and written
-which were welcome by the Court.
3.6(cid:9) Indeed, the basics of natural justice were complied
with. All the material and relevant information on
which the court proposed to base its findings and
conclusions were made available to the parties.
3.7(cid:9) They were allowed to have their say and offer
comments thereon, which they did. As the facts show,
the cause of accident was obscure.(cid:9) The procedure
adopted by the Court enabled the parties concerned
constructing their respective hypotheses as could
seriously be regarded as possibilities based on the
material collected. Undoubtedly, this approach
67

involved some degree of speculation and exploration.
Eye witness account had stood completely eliminated
so far as the cause and circumstances of the accident
were concerned. Hence this was the only course open
to the Court. The Court has thus reached its
conclusions on the lines contemplated by Chapter 1 of
DOC 6920.
3.8(cid:9) It may not be out of place to mention that at the
very commencement of the oral hearings before the
court, all the parties without exception-
unhesitatingly expressed(cid:9) their approval and
appreciation of the procedure adopted by the Court
and requested that the same be placed on record.

CHAPTER 111-3
PROCEEDINGS OF THE COURT
3.9(cid:9) Soon after notification of the constitution of the
Court on 15.11.96; the site of the accident was
visited on 16.11.96, and again on 25.11.96.(cid:9) In
between, there was another visit by Assessor Air Cmde
T. Pannu on 18.11.96
3.10(cid:9) On 20.11.96, the ATC tapes were played before the
court. It was decided to have the transcript of the
tapes prepared under the supervision of the Assessor
Air Cmde T.Pannu.
3.11(cid:9) A public notice (placed at App._A) was issued on
21.11.96. It was published on 25.11.96 in leading
national dailies of India having wide circulation in
Delhi and Haryana. The Republic of Kazakhstan
published the notice in its newspapers on 25th/26th
December, 1996.(cid:9) The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,
however, made the publication on 16th/18th January,
1997.
3.12(cid:9) The two sets of black boxes having been retrieved,
information was gathered on availability of
69

facilities(cid:9) for decoding of the DFDR/FDR. On
21.11.96, the Court held a meeting whereat a team of
experts from National Aeronautical Laboratry (NAL),
Bangalore headed by Dr Nagabhushan also participated.
It was confirmed that the Boeing 747 DFDR could be
decoded by NAL at Bangalore with the assistance of
equipment available with Air India at their Avionics
Overhaul Division, Bombay. As to the FDR installed on
IL-76 it was pointed out that since this type of
aircraft was in the fleet of Indian Air Force the
facility for decoding could be explored with them.
3.13(cid:9) In an all-party hearing on 28.11.96, both Kazak and
Saudi Airlines expressed their apprehensions about
the adequacy of the facilities with the NAL,
Bangalore compared with the advanced techniques and
equipment available overseas.(cid:9) Both the sides
insisted on the decoding being done outside India.
IAF could not readily confirm its ability to help in
decoding the model of the FDR retrieved from the ill-
fated IL-76 aircraft. On an overall assessment of the
information made available, the views expressed by
the parties and the background of the nature of the
accident wherein the black boxes were the most vital
evidence, rather the only piece of evidence
70

(cid:9)(cid:9)
available, it was decided that IL-76 black boxes be
decoded at the Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC),
Moscow and Boeing 747 black boxes be decoded at Air
Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB),(cid:9) Farnborough,
UK in the presence of such parties as may wish to
remain present. This was agreed to by all concerned.
3.14(cid:9) The initial programme of the court proceedings which
were fixed for decoding of the black boxes within the
country by moving to Avionics Overhaul Division of
Air India Bombay, NAL Bangalore and IAF Station
Chandigarh had to be cancelled and a fresh itinerary
was chalked out.
3.15(cid:9) The Court was of the opinion that before moving the
black boxes outside the country it would be advisable
to have copies of the original tapes prepared which
could be taken out for decoding outside the country
or else the originals could be taken out leaving the
copies behind so as not to take any risk of any piece
of evidence being lost or damaged in transit.
However, the agencies (i.e. IAC and AAIB) which were
to be entrusted with and involved in the task of
decoding were of the opinion that the originals must
be made available to them.
71

3.16(cid:9)
The IAC Moscow sent its experts with necessary
equipment to Delhi for preparing copies of the FDR
and CVR tapes of IL-76 aircraft. However, efforts at
having similar exercise of preparing copies of DFDR
and CVR tapes of Boeing-747 at Bombay could not
materialise for want of positive response from
M/s.Lockheed Martin and M/s.Fairchild, the
manufacturers.
3.17(cid:9)
The Court visited IAC Moscow where decoding of IL-76
black boxes was carried out on 13,14 and 15 Feb 97.
Preliminary analysis report and retrieved data were
made available, which, along with Boeing black boxes,
were carried to London on 16.2.97. A supplementary
report from IAC was to follow within a fortnight so
that systemic and incidental errors including faults,
if any, could be removed and the compliance of all
the parameters registered could be checked as
suggested by them.(cid:9)
The four altimeters retrieved
from IL-76 aircraft were also entrusted to IAC Moscow
for research and analysis which, as was assured,
would be accomplished through the State Scientific
Research Institute, a sister organisation of IAC. The
Supplementary /Final Report dated 27.3.97 was
72

(cid:9)(cid:9)
received in Delhi through the Indian Embassy only on
29.3.97.
Decoding of Boeing-747 black boxes was carried out at
3.18(cid:9)
AAIB, Farnborough from 17.2.97 to 24.2.97. The data
made available by IAC Moscow was also handed over to
AAIB so as to cross check and synchronise all the
data retrieved.
Besides various discussions from time to time, a
3.19(cid:9)
final meeting was held with AAIB experts on 24.2.97
when they handed over their report accompanied by
data retrieval documents.(cid:9) The AAIB assured the
Court of sending a supplementary report after
further research and intensive study was carried out.
The supplementary Report dated 21.3.97 was received
in Delhi on 23.3.97.
On 27.3.97, it was decided to have a pre-hearing
3.20(cid:9)
session with all the parties on 8.4.97, notices for
which were given. On 8.4.97 the Court made available
to all the parties participating in the proceedings
copies of all the material collected by the Court
which was sought to be relied upon at the hearing.
The participating parties were asked to file their
73

respective statements on affidavits latest by 21.4.97
containing the following (inter alia ) :
(i) Version of the party as regards the
accident to the extent to which it relates
to or concerns that party;
(ii) Comments/submissions of the party on
the evidence/ material available before the
Court of Inquiry;
(iii)the pleas sought to be urged before the
Court of Inquiry;
(iv) Suggestions which the party proposes to
make for the purpose of inclusion in the
recommendations to be made by the Court
of Inquiry;
(v) Documents/statements which the party may
propose to be placed before the Court of
Inquiry;
It was further directed that :-
(i) Statements/documents to be filed shall be
prepared in sets of 15 each enabling exchange
amongst all the participants;
(ii) Statements/documents in a language other than
English must be accompanied with English
74

translation along with verification by the
Translator.
The parties were advised to collect the copies of the
statements filed by other parties between 3 and 5
P.M. on the same day.
The parties were allowed liberty of inspecting the
originals of the material collected by the Court of
Inquiry(cid:9) subject to previous appointment with the
Secretary.
3.21(cid:9) On 25.4.97, the second pre-hearing session was held
for formulating points at issue and laying down
procedure of hearing.
The proceedings of 25.4.97 being material are
reproduced in full :
At the outset the court thanked all the parties and
their eminent counsel for the cooperation extended
by them in expediting the Court of Inquiry
proceedings. It was emphasised that the Court was
inquiring into one of the most tragic events in the
history of civil aviation resulting into loss of
human life. The object of the constitution of the
Court of Inquiry is to inquire into the causes and
circumstances of the tragic accident and to make
observations and recommendations for future so as to
avoid recurrence of such accidents. The Court of
Inquiry is not to fix the fault or blame on any one.
It is expected that the parties would continue to
75

extend their cooperation in expediting the hearing
and thereby reaching the avowed object of the Court
of Inquiry at an early date.
The evidence and the documents collected by the
Court of Inquiry have been made available to the
parties. Liberty has been allowed to the parties to
inspect the originals as well. Pursuant to the
order dated 8.4.97 the parties have filed their
affidavits. None of the parties has laid any
challenge to the correctness of the factual(cid:9) data
retrieved with the assistance of IAC Moscow and AAIB
Farnborough. In the light of the statements of the
participating parties as set out in their respective
affidavits it is considered not necessary to record
any oral evidence. The reports/ documents can be
marked as exhibits. The participating parties have
expressed their agreement to such a course being
adopted.
As to the procedure to be followed at the hearing,
after hearing the parties and their learned counsel,
it is decided that the oral hearing would eminence
w.e.f. 28.4.97 as per the(cid:9) following calendar
which suits convenience of all the parties :
DAY AND DATE(cid:9) PARTY TO BE HEARD
MONDAY(cid:9) 28.4.97(cid:9) Republic of Kazakhstan
TUESDAY(cid:9) 29.4.97(cid:9) Kazakhstan Airlines

The hearing shall be on the following issues :
1. What are the causes of the accident and the
circumstances thereof ?
2. In the background of the facts and
circumstances and causes of the accident,
what are the recommendations that are
required to be made so as to avoid recurrence
of such accidents in future ?
Mr Salimov, accredited representative of Kazak
Republic and Mr Amitabh Chaturvedi advocate for Kazak
Airlines have assured to make(cid:9) available a
corrected/revised transcript of IL-76 CVR and
English translation(cid:9) of(cid:9) the(cid:9) relevant(cid:9) portions
pointed out during the course of hearing.
Air Cmde Sarma also insisted on the Kazak Airlines
filing IL-76 cockpit layout plan including crew sta-
tions and their respective instrument panels. Mr John
Barnum has assured to have the same filed at the earli-
est.
Mr John Barnum submitted that a copy of DFDR tape of
IL-76 be made available to his party.(cid:9) The tape has
been read out and decoded at IAC Moscow, a centre
chosen by Kazak side and in the presence of all the
parties.(cid:9) The data retrieved and print-outs have
been made available to all the parties. It is not
necessary to supply copy of the DFDR(cid:9) tape.(cid:9) Saudi
77

Arabian Airlines and Kazak Airlines have both moved
applications seeking direction of the court for
allowing visit of their experts to ATC facilities at
Delhi Airport.
Air Cmde Sarma submitted on behalf of Airport Author-
ity of India that this may lead to a roving inquiry
and an attempt at finding out such facts which
travel beyond the(cid:9) scope(cid:9) of(cid:9) the Inquiry.(cid:9) After
hearing the parties, it is directed that :
1.(cid:9) The Airports(cid:9) Authority of India
shall(cid:9) permit visit(cid:9) by(cid:9) the ATC
experts/ representatives of Saudi
Arabian PCA/Airlines,(cid:9) Kazakhstan
Republic/(cid:9) Airlines on Thursday the
1st May, 1997 at 3.00 pm; each party
to restrict the number of its repre-
sentatives to four. The Boeing compa-
ny do not wish to join.
2(cid:9) The visit shall be confined to
Aerodrome Control Tower,(cid:9) Radar/
Approach control and Area(cid:9) control
Centres.
3. The visit shall be under the
control(cid:9) and supervision(cid:9) of the
Assessor, Air Cmde T. Pannu.
4. The AAI shall file before the Court
a statement of Local ATC Operating
Instructions/ Manual. So much part
of the Manuals/ Instructions as are
standardised by ICAO and published (
hence even otherwise available to
everyone ) need not be filed.
78

3.22(cid:9) The(cid:9) hearings were held in open court on 28,29,30
April and 1,12,13,14, and 15 May, 1997. Each of the
parties addressing the Court filed a brief synopsis of
its submissions at the beginning and was allowed
liberty of filing its detailed written submissions at
the end of the hearing which the parties did.
3.23.(cid:9) The manufacturers of IL-76 must have been aware of the
proceedings from the very date of the accident and
also through publication of notice in Kazakhstan. At
one stage of the proceedings an individual notice was
also given. However, they chose not to participate in
the proceedings.
3.24.(cid:9) ATC Guild of India represented through Shri
Brijender Shekhar Shukla, General Secretary sought
intervention in the proceedings which was allowed.

CHAPTER IV-1
ANALYSIS - HAIN ISSUES
4.1(cid:9) As the facts of the accident show, all possible
direct evidence has stood excluded by the cruel
hands of death. There has been no survivor. The
cause and the circumstances of the accident have to
be determined from circumstances as deducible from
the data retrieved from the two sets of black boxes
of the two ill-fated aircraft.
4.2(cid:9) The cause of the accident is obscure and therefore,
as contemplated by Chapter I ( Purpose of the
Inquiry) of DOC. 6920,(cid:9) it became necessary to
pursue as many hypotheses as could seriously be
regarded as possibilities and then pursue each to
the limits of its logical end, this being the only
course open.(cid:9) Keeping this in view, all the
participants were asked by the Court on 25.4.97 to
set out their respective and possible versions of
the accident(cid:9) on the basis of the material
available before the Court or proposed to be
brought on record.
4.3(cid:9) The hypotheses/theories which were suggested by the
86

parties before the Court may be set out by
borrowing from each of their statements,as under :-
(4.3/A)(cid:9) REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN AND KAZAKHSTAN AIRLINES
(KAZAK SIDE) THEORY
"The cause of the collision was the fact that the
Kazakhstan Airlines was flying below 15000 ft,
according to FDRs of both aircraft, probably as low
as 14100 ft. The reason that the KAZAK PLANE was
at that altitude was the weather conditions at the
time.
There were two weather conditions that effected the
Kazak crew's ability to avoid the collision : (i)
there were clouds which prevented the aircraft from
seeing each other (ii) both aircraft entered
turbulence immediately before the collision which
in the case of the Kazak aircraft forced it down
by as much as 1000 ft.
Contributing causes for collision and the main
reason that the Kazakhstan crew were unable to
avoid the collision were the short comings of the
ATC system of Delhi airport and the failure of the
ATC to (i) issue adequate and timely warning of the
apprcach of the Saudi aircraft on a collision
87

course and (ii) instrucz both aircraft to perform
a common and prudent collIsion avoidance manouvre."
4.3/B(cid:9) THE KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA IND SAUDI ARABIAN AIRLINES
(SAUDI SIDE) THEORY
"Lack of coordination in the cockpit and poor
cockpit resource management, procedures and
(cid:9)
communications together with confusion in the
cockpit of the Kazak aircraft may provide the
cause.
ATC equipment, systems, single approach and
departure corridor ( G452), shift manning, working
conditions, the overall record of air misses and
operational procedures may have contributed to the
cause of the accident, which all need to be
investigated."
4.3/C(cid:9) AIRPORTS AUTHORITY OF INDIA'S THEORY
"The collision occurred close to FL 140 to which
the Kazak aircraft had descended, unauthorisedly
departing from the assigned FL 150 and this
happened because of the inadequacy of knowledge of
aviation English on the part of the IL-76 cockpit
crew; absence of proper flight discipline and
proper crew task sharing ;airmanship ) on the part
88

(cid:9)(cid:9)
of the crew of IL-76.
All the relevant data from the DFDR/FDR has been
4.4(cid:9)
successfully retrieved with the help of the two
expert accident investigating agencies- IAC, Moscow
and AAIB, Farnborough ( Hants) UK. The CVRs of the
two ill-fated aircraft could also be read out and
transcripts of the recordings prepared. Transcript
of ATC tape recordings was also prepared. The three
recordings tally with one another and cross confirm
the conversation so as to project a picture of what
-
transpired amongst the ATC Delhi, IL-76 and Boeing
747. The recordings also provide a glimpse into a
scenario of each of the cockpits of the two
aircraft at the crucial time of the accident and
just preceding it. Inferences have to be drawn by
analysing and appreciating the phraseology used,
the utterances made and the silence observed by the
crew members, their moods as reflected in the tone
or accent of speech etc.
4.5(cid:9) We proceed to marshal the material available from
the following points of view :
At what flight level did the accident
(i)
take place?
How and why did the two aircraft reach
(ii)
89

the same flight level leading to
collision?
(iii) Could air turbulence have caused the
loss of altitude resulting in the
collision?
4.6(cid:9)
The analysis of the data retrieved from the
DFDR/FDR of both the aircraft points out to the
accident having taken place at FL 140 (or in close
proximity of FL 140). On receipt of reports from the
two investigating agencies, not only it was not
disputed but rather it became an admitted fact
agreed to by all the parties before the court that
this was
the flight lev'l at which the two ill-fated
aircraft were at the time of collision. The Court
too having independently rev ewed
(cid:9) the data
retrieved from the two FDRs is of the opinion that
FL140(cid:9)
was indeed the level at which the two
aircraft collided.
4.7(cid:9)
The IAC Moscow has concluded[ See: Appendix 8-2(T)]:
The altitude at the moment of collision
was 4300 +100/-200 m. as per the data
from MSRP recordings taking into account
the errors and calibrated curve of the
sensor.
4.8(cid:9)
It was also opined by the IAC :
"In order to determine the collision
altitude more accurately it is necessary
to analyse the results of the decoding
90

(cid:9)(cid:9)
of the flight parameters of IL-76 and
Boeing-747 aircraft together."
4.9(cid:9) It was the above observation made by the IAC which
primarily persuaded the Court in making available
the data released by IAC, Moscow to AAIB,
Farnborough where the Boeing-747 black boxes were
decoded.
4.10(cid:9) The AAIB, Farnborough analysed the data retrieved
from IL-76 FDR and concluded that the recorded
altitude at the time of collision was 14100 ft
but found the expected tolerances in measurement and
recording as +/- 500 ft. Thus, the actual altitude
was likely to have been between 13600 and 14600 ft.
As to Saudia B-747 aircraft the AAIB has found that
the overall accuracy could be +/- 120 ft keeping in
view possible tolerances within the analoge to
digital conversion process. Immediately prior to
collision the Saudi aircraft recorded altitude of
13900 ft. This would mean that true altitude at
collision was between 13780 and 14020 ft. The AAIB
made a comparison of recorded altitudes with the
expected values on the accident flight take off and
the cruise levels on several flights and found that
at the collision altitude the DFDR of B-747 was
91

(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)
under-reading by 100 ft which was within the
expected tolerance level. It thus follows that the
Boeing 747 was at(cid:9) (13900 ft recorded +100 ft
correctional factor) 14000ft i.e. FL 140(cid:9) (See-
Appendix C-3).
4.11(cid:9) Here itself we may deal with Report on Scientific
analysis of Altimeters.
4.12(cid:9) All the three altimeters of Saudi Boeing-747 were
destroyed by fire after impact on ground.
4.13(cid:9) Four Altimeters of Kazak IL-76 were recovered in
damaged condition.(cid:9) There were two mechanical
(barometric) foot-altimeters and two electric
(servo) altimeters with metric scale. All the four
altimeter instruments had been sent to the State
Scientific Research Institute of Aero Navigation
(SSRIAN) through the IAC, Moscow for scientific
examination. Their report [ See- Appendix-B-3(T)]
has given the following information :
(a) Captain's altimeter (0818194) read 4443 m
(14,576ft) with the pressure scale set at
760 mm Hg
(b) Co-pilot's altimeter (0513164) read 4540 m
(14,895 ft) with the pressure scale set at
92

(cid:9)(cid:9)
760 mm Hg.
The above readings have been established "at
the moment when power supply to the
instruments was cut off probably due to the
destruction of the aircraft structure."
(c) Captain's foot altimeter (0613061) was set
at about 1012 Hpa.
(d) Navigator's foot altimeter (0508040) was set
at 1013 Hpa.
No readings could be determined from the foot
altimeters.
4.14(cid:9) As can be seen, the SSRIAN report does not help in
determining the actual altitude of the IL-76
aircraft at the time of collision, particularly, in
view of the vast difference of 97 m (319 ft) between
the two pilots' altimeters. The erratic indications
could have resulted from the forces of collision
besides the possible effect of highly disturbed
atmospheric pressure around the pitot-static area at
the moment of collision.
4.15(cid:9) Because of inconclusive findings by the research
institute in respect of altimeter readings, all
parties have relied on FDR data and unanimously
accepted flight level 140 as the altitude at which
93

(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)
collision occurred. We have also formed the same
opinion.
4.16(cid:9) What were the flight levels assigned-to the two
aircraft?(cid:9) If the flight level assigned to Saudi
aircraft was 140 and to Kazak aircraft was 150 why
and how Kazak aircraft descended to FL 140 ?(cid:9) To
find answers to these questions we shall have to
develop the IL-76 cockpit scenario as deducible from
CVR transcript.
4.17(cid:9) ANALYSIS OF CVR TRANSCRIPT
4.18(cid:9) Saudi aircraft : Saudi 763 maintained its assigned
FL 140 without any deviation. This fact is agreed
to by all the parties before the Court. Thus having
ruled out the possibility of any error on the part
of Saudi pilots (one of the three main parties
involved in the accident), the focus obviously
shifts to the actions of Kazak Pilots/crew, weather
conditions and the role of the Delhi ATC.
4.19(cid:9) Kazak Pilots/Crew. Investigation reports from
AAIB, UK and IAC, Moscow have given full details of
the DFDR and CVR read-outs. These were thoroughly
scrutinised.(cid:9) Thereafter, in order to examine the
turn of events, transcripts of IL-76 CVR, B-747 CVR
94

and ATC tape recordings were compared. Except the
intra-cockpit transmissions, these were uniform.
After comparing the three, a consolidated CVR
transcript was prepared covering about eight minutes
before the collision. This became necessary as IAC
themselves ( in their report- Appendix B-2(T)) had
expressed their doubts on the quality of translation
of intra-cockpit Russian conversations into English
by their scientists, who were not proficient enough
in the English language.(cid:9) The text (including
translation into English of Russian and Arabic words
wherever occurring) was agreed to and accepted as
correct by all the parties. Such text is at
Appendix D.
Two points may be noted as to this transcript. There
4.20(cid:9)
was a slight variation in recordings of time in
ATC tape and IL-76 aircraft CVR observed from
beginning to end.(cid:9) Since these were uniform, the
time indicated in IL-76 aircraft CVR was taken as
reference datum. Altitudes(cid:9) have been noted in
column 5.(cid:9) These notings suggest an altitude of
14886 ft having been maintained for a period of 11.5
seconds ( between 13:09:27.5 and 13:09:39) and again
recorded altitude of 14495 having been maintained
95

for a period of ten seconds ( between 13:09:39.5 and
13:09:49.5 ). The court has not accepted the theory
of Kazak aircraft having levelled out at these
altitudes. The Court tends to believe(cid:9) that the
Kazak aircraft was in the process of continuous
descent.(cid:9)
This opinion is based on AAIB's report
dated 21.3.97 (Appendix C-3) which has attributed
the rapid changes in altitude values to "Stickiness"
of the sensor (transducer) giving input to the FDR.
The said report further states that "the IL-76
aircraft was in a constant descent through 15000 ft.
and may not, or may only just have levelled before
the collision. This fact is also supported by the
IAC report (Appendix B-3(T) which states that 'sharp
changes in values (upto 250 mtrs. in one second) of
altitude recordings are due to wider insensitive
(dead) zones of the Sensor'.(cid:9)
Before proceeding
further it may be relevant to keep in mind that
after establishing contact with Delhi Area (West),
the Kazak PIC in his briefing to the crew had
directed that Radio Operator would act as the
communications leader as the following extract from
the CVR transcript shows :-
"Well then, the alternate is Bombay, Karachi,
good weather, Fuel for the alternate is for
FIVE HOURS, Heading 284, Approach System is
96

ILS in Director Regime, Minimum 60 on 800...
illegible 1800, Active at the Right, Control
at the Left, Communication leads the
Radioman."
4.21(cid:9) The analysis of the CVR transcript leads us to
the following scenario/inferences :-
(a)(cid:9) Radio Operator of Kazak 1907 establishes
contact with Delhi Approach at 13:04:55
and is given further descent to FL 150.
This clearance is acknowledged by Radio
operator NaVigator promptly converts the
level into 4570 meters.(cid:9) Again, at
13:07:24 Radio Operator re-confirms with
Navigator(cid:9) (in intra-cockpit Russian
Conversation)(cid:9) that FL 150 was 4570
meters.(cid:9) Since all crew were listening
out, it can safely be assumed that each
crew member should have understood the
descent clearance to FL 150.
(b)(cid:9) At(cid:9) 13:06:10(cid:9) Saudia(cid:9) 763(cid:9) reported
on the same channel "approaching FL 100"
and was cleared by ATC to climb to FL 140.
Again at 13:08:50,when he reported
approaching FL 140 and requested for
further climb he was told to maintain FL-
140 which he acknowledged.(cid:9) These two
messages should have, at least, indicated
to the Kazak pilots that Saudia aircraft
was somewhere in the air and that its
climb beyond FL 140 had been restricted.
Pilots are always required to maintain a
continuous listening watch and to be extra
alert while flying in the Terminal Control
Areas. It, however, appears (as would be
seen a little later) that Kazak pilots
paid no attention to these significant
transmissions.
(c) Immediately after Saudia 763 was
instructed to maintain FL 140, Radio
Operator of Kazak 1907 on being asked by
ATC, reported at 13:08:59 "Now reached FL
150, four six miles from Delta Papa
November, radial two seven zero." As seen
97

from the DFDR recording, the aircraft was,
at this time, only passing through 16348
feet. This incorrect reporting could be
either due to casualness i.e. without
reference to the instrument panel of which
he did not have a clear view or because he
did not understand the difference between
'reached' and 'approaching'. Either way,
it was not acceptable. Then followed the
transmission from ATC "Roger, maintain FL
150.(cid:9) Identified(cid:9) traffic 12 O'Clock,
reciprocal, Saudia Boeing 747 at ten
miles, likely to cross in another five
miles.(cid:9) Report; if in sight."(cid:9) Radio
Operator took unusually long to assimilate
this message indicating difficulty in the
comprehension of ATC instructions. This
would not have been so, had the crew paid
attention to the preceding transmission
i.e. Saudia 763 being asked to maintain FL
140.
(d) Contrary to this, when Radio Operator was
busy talking to ATC about the reciprocal
traffic, Pilot In Command and Co-Pilot
indulged in overlapping intra-cockpit
conversation(cid:9) regarding(cid:9) traffic
information( CVR time 12:09:28 and
12:09:29).
(e) Finally, it appears that Radio Operator
did understand the implications of ATC
message "Traffic (reciprocal) is at eight
miles, level 140" as he acknowledged by
saying "Now looking 1907." In the
process, Co-pilot, busy as he was with
other tasks and half attentive to ATC,
grasped apparently wrong meaning thinking
that he was cleared to FL 140 and he
continued to descend to that level.
Ironically, though probably guided by the
same perception, Pilot in command did not
intervene.
(f) Strangely, Navigator (who was expected to
monitor altitude of the aircraft and
periodically give appropriate call outs)
98

also did not react when the aircraft
continued descending below FL 150.
However, at 13:09:57 an intra-cockpit
(g)
utterance "Hold the level" from one of the
crew (by all accounts it could be Radio
Operator, who knew and did feel that the
aircraft should have stopped descent)
alerted the Pilot in command who inquired
at 13:09:59 (18 seconds before collision)
"What level we were given?" This query
completely exposed his lack of situational
awareness highly(cid:9) unexpected of a
commander.
(h) Flight Engineer added to the confusion by
calling out "maintain" (ostensibly FL 140,
to which the aircraft had already
descended).(cid:9) Radio Operator, however,
immediately clarified by shouting "keep
the 150th, don't descend" (confirming the
fact that he was simply answering the
Pilot in command's earlier query and being
away from the instruments, did not know
the exact level of the aircraft).
As observed from the tone of intra-cockpit
(1)(cid:9)
conversation, a high level of anxiety
seems to have developed in the cockpit by
this time and preparations to get out of
the dangerous situation began. Autopilot
was switched off at 13:10:05 (11 seconds
before collision) and Pilot in command
asked FE to accelerate (presumably to
climb).Soon after but only(cid:9) 4 seconds
before collision, Radio Operator (probably
after looking at the altimeter) shouted
(in desperation) with the words "get to
150 because on the 140th uh that one
uh!"and just about then the collision
occurred.(cid:9) Both the aircraft were
presumably in a cloud layer, which seems
to have prevented timely visual sighting
of each by the other. Switching on of VNA
( Engine Heating) by IL-76 crew indicates
presence of cloud.
4.22(cid:9) From the foregoing narrative and crew actions,
the irresistible conclusions which can safely be
99

drawn are as follows :-
(i) Kazak 1907 violated ATC instructions
and descended below its assigned FL 150
to FL 140, which was assigned to
Saudia-763. This is the direct/primary
cause of collision.
(ii) The entire Kazak crew except Radio
Operator took wrong meaning of
"Traffic' is at eight miles, level one
four zero" as the clearance for them to
descend to FL 140. Such action can be
attributed to their lack of working
knowledge of English.
(iii) None of the Crew understood the traffic
situation in the vicinity.(cid:9) This is
borne out by their failure to link up
just the preceding transmission to
Saudia 763 asking him to maintain FL
140. Besides inattention, their lack
of proficiency in English language is
clearly borne out.
(iv) Broadly speaking each crew did not know
what the others were doing. Even when
known, the wrong actions were not cross
checked and corrected. Hence it was a
case of poorly orgnanised team, wherein
each individual was on his own.
(v) Even after realising the blunder of
being in a dangerous situation at least
18 seconds before collision, the Pilot
in command failed to take corrective
action promptly. This reflects poor
leadership qualities and lack of proper
crew resource management ( CRM) on the
part of the Pilot in command.
(vi) There is no evidence of any standard
call-outs ( reminder calls) made by any
of the crew members of IL-76. This is
contrary to the universal practice of
such calls by the non flying pilot (
PNF) or another designated crew member
during specified phases of flight.
These calls become more relevant in
100

(cid:9)(cid:9)
cases of non availability of automated
crew alerting systems such as Altitude
Alert System.
(vii)(cid:9) Last but not the least, presence of
cloud at that crucial time did -prevent
timely visual sighting which could have
been the last straw in saving the
catastrophe.
4.23(cid:9) Effect of weather conditions : Whether the drop
of 1000 ft (approx) in level of Kazak aircraft
can be attributed to turbulence?.
4.24(cid:9) The IAC Moscow has opined:
"while the elevator was being turned to reduce
vertical speed and the aircraft was being brought
to horizontal flight, ( relative altitude 200M
from collision altitude) the aircraft entered
first zone of weak and then a zone of moderate
turbulence. Vertical load factor in the zone of
turbulence varied from 0.6 to 1.4 units and the
lateral load factor from minus 0.1 to plus 0.1
units. When the aircraft was inside the cloud
cover the crew switched on the engine VNA (guide
vanes- Russian letters used are- BHA) heating AND
then, at 13:10:0.5, switched off the automatic on
-board control systems with the quick switch -off
button while continuing to bring the aircraft
101

into horizontal flight."
4.25(cid:9) AAIB(cid:9) has(cid:9) opined
"From the recordings of acceleration on both
aircraft there seemed to be an increased
turbulence level for about 30 seconds before
collision.(cid:9) This may be indicative of the
aircraft entering a cloud layer."
This finding only suggests presence of cloud and, in
no way, hints at any loss of altitude due to this.
However, the AAIB did find indications of some
stickiness in the sampling transducer because of
which an attempt was made to derive altitude using
two other methods:- (i) double integration of the
accelerometer data and, (ii) using pitch incidence
and air speed. The result of both methods for the
descent from 20,000 ft until collision are shown in
figure IL-76/6 ( Appendix C='3(i) refers) AAIB has
concluded(cid:9)
that "the aircraft was in a constant
descent through 15000 ft and may not or may only
just have levelled before the collision". It thus
became evident(cid:9) that IL-76 maintained normal
(controlled) descent unaffected by the turbulence.
102

4.26(cid:9) The Kazak' side initially pleaded that it was on
account of serious turbulence that the Kazak air-
craft dropped by 1000 ft. At a later stage it was
submitted that there were two drops of about 500 ft
each (approx). The existence of such turbulence as
advocated by the Kazak side does not appeal to the
Court and is ruled out for the following reasons :
(a) The forecast and actual weather report
from Indian Meteorological Department
(IMD) (based on satellite interpretation,
over the accident area and near the time
of collision indicated presence of
"isolated to scattered medium/high clouds
over the region" with "No Echo" at 1145
and 1445 UTC.(cid:9) In their opinion, no
turbulence was expected in the clouds
herein mentioned.( Appendices E, F & G )
(b) Capt. Timothy J. Place, Commander of the
USAF aircraft from Islamabad to Delhi,
passing near the site of accident has
deposed : "We were in the clear (VMC)
when a cloud to our two o' clock position
lit up. The light was orange in colour and
its intensity continued to increase. We
were somewhere between FL200 and FL 140 (
estimate). The cloud from what I saw as
it lit up was about .20=40 miles from us,
about 20-30 miles in length in a line
approx parallel to our path. It was approx
5000 ft from base to top with the top
about even with or slightly below our
altitude."
Thus the cloud was approximately 5000 ft.
in thickness extending vertically from
about 12000 ft. and spread horizontally
about 20-30 miles. This means that it was
a medium cloud, not likely to cause
turbulence to such an extent that air
103

craft would lose as much as 1000 ft. of
altitude.(cid:9) AAIB report also brings out
turbulence activity for 30 sec. when the
closure rate of both the aircraft was 1300
ft/sec.(cid:9) As per this, the horizontal
extent of cloud works out to about 7 NM.
Analysis of both these reports indicates
that the cloud in question could at the
most be cumulus type, which is not known
to give rise to severe turbulence.
Therefore, loss of altitude to the extent
of 1000 ft. and that too abruptly by an
IL-76 type of aircraft cannot be accepted.
(c) The Saudi aircraft which was flying at
almost the same level with a longitudinal
separation of only 6 to 7 miles did not
report of any turbulence nor have its DFDR
recordings revealed any sudden/steep
variation in altitude.
(d) If indeed the cockpit crew of IL-76 had
experienced moderate or severe turbulence
at that crucial stage when it was
descending and was about to cross another
aircraft approaching reciprocally, and
consequently experienced sudden/steep
variation in altitude, it is inconceivable
that none in the cockpit would have made
some mention of it to ATC(cid:9) or even in
intra-cockpit conversation.
(e) The DFDR recordings of IL 76 gave an
impression that at times IL-76 descended
as much as 391 ft. in half-a-second.(cid:9) If
the aircraft were to actually descend at
that rate i.e. about 47000 ft./min.(cid:9) the
'g' force (approx. 44 g) would have been
such that the aircraft would have
certainly disintegrated. This is not
supported by DFDR recordings of 'g'
values, which remained close to 1 g.
Hence the largely varying recorded values
of the altitude parameter within the same
second, were the result of 'stickiness' in
the transducer and as such have to be
ignored.
(f) RLS radar on-board IL-76 would have surely
104

(cid:9)(cid:9)
indicated the presence/intensity of
weather encountered and the crew would
have been compelled to request ATC for
circum-navigating the same.(cid:9) Nothing of
this sort was done.
(g) There is no indication/evidence of
passenger seat belt sign being "switched
on" as is expected during flight through
turbulence.
(h) AAIB's conclusion (after ignoring the re-
versed altitudes at DFDR time frames 738,
721,720.5,(cid:9) 694.5(cid:9) and(cid:9) 692(cid:9) due(cid:9) to
'Stickiness)' that the IL-76 was in a
constant descent through 15000 ft. and may
not, or may only just have levelled before
collision is valid. Thus, it was a case of
continuous controlled descent as against
abrupt loss as advocated by Kazaks. Also,
IAC Moscow report does not show descent in
steps. This aspect has been ignored by
Kazaks.
4.27(cid:9) Role of Delhi ATC
4.28(cid:9) At the hearings the following aspects of the role of
Delhi ATC were brought in issue :-
(a) Whether Vertical separation of 1000 ft
assigned by ATC to the two aircraft was
adequate?
(b) Were the two aircraft brought on a collision
course by ATC?
(c) Why was Kazak aircraft not given timely
information about Saudia Flight? Also, why
was Saudia not informed about Kazak flight at
all?
105

Why was Saudia aircraft permitted to take
(d)
off and not held on ground till Kazak
aircraft had landed?
Why did ATC not ask either or both aircraft
(e)
to execute manoeuvre to take them away from
each other :
Why is there only a Single Corridor at Delhi
(f)
for both arriving and departing flights?
Non-availability of SSR at Delhi airport
(g)
contributed to the accident.
(h) ATC work load was excessive.
(i) ATC Coordination was lacking.
Visit to Delhi Airport ATC facilities by the
(j)
team(cid:9) of(cid:9) Kazak(cid:9) ATC(cid:9) specialists.
4.29. We cannot resist observing that an accurate and
complete understanding of the role of the ATC and the
meaning of various terms would have avoided most of
the abovementioned controversies.
4.30(cid:9) Relevant extract from ICAO Annex 11 is reproduced
below :-
2.2 Objectives of Air Traffic Services
The objectives of air traffic services shall be to
(a)(cid:9) Prevent collisions between aircraft;
106

(b) Prevent collisions between aircraft in the
manoeuvz:ing area and obstructions in that
area;
(c) Expedite and maintain an orderly flow of air
traffic;
(d) Provide advice and information useful for the
safe and efficient conduct of flights;
(e) Notify appropriate organisations regarding
aircraft in need of search and rescue aid, and
assist such organisations as required.
4.31.(cid:9) Among others, ICAO Doc 4444 (Rules of the Air and
Air Traffic"Services) contains the provisions
governing the procedures aimed to achieve the
objectives of ATS as mentioned above. The correct
position regarding separation is laid down in Doc
4444.(cid:9) Doc 9426 (ATS Planning Manual) is another
important document pertaining to ATS.
4.32(cid:9) SEPARATION MINIMA ICAO Doc 4444, Part III, Para 1.1
(Page 3-1) (13th Edn-1996) which applies to Area and
Approach Control Service, clearly states that
'vertical or horizontal separation' shall be
provided in the cases cited therein, which includes
between IFR flights in Class D air space, in which
107

the two aircraft were in the present case. Para 3.1
further stipulates that the vertical separation
minima shall be, in the present case, a nominal 1000
ft.,' being below FL 290. This standard separation
has been approved by ICAO after taking into account
possible errors and tolerances.(cid:9) This is being
practiced all across the globe.(cid:9) As for the
clearance, it has been in accordance with DOC 4444,
Part-III, Section 10.(cid:9) Doc 4444 specifically
cautions against application of excessive separation
as it would negate the very objective of expediting
traffic.(cid:9) Neither any provisions of ICAO
Annexes/Docs nor under any common practice was it
required in the present case to provide a larger
separation and it is clear from Para 5.7, Part III,
Doc 4444 that, even under severe turbulence
conditions, a vertical separation of 1000 ft. was
adequate.
4.32.1(cid:9) Radar services in Air Traffic Management contemplate
only horizontal separation between aircraft. (cid:9) Such
horizontal separation may be either lateral
separation or longitudinal separation.(cid:9) Vertical
separation is not a part of separation under radar
services but is procedural separation. Even when
Primary and Secondary radar/ MSSR are installed,
108

(cid:9)(cid:9)
radar separation would still be only horizontal
separation, though with MSSR facility it would be
possible for the radar controller to know the
altitude of the aircraft as an additional input so
as to plan the separation as well as manage the flow
of traffic.(cid:9) Thus when horizontal separation is
provided under radar services, vertical separation
is not additionally necessary, and vice versa, when
vertical separation is provided horizontal
separation is not additionally necessary.
4.32.2(cid:9) In relation to separation minima, India has not
filed any differences with ICAO as regards the
provisions contained in ICAO Doc 4444. The vertical
separation of 1000 ft. provided in this case was in
conformity with ICAO standards and was sufficient to
ensure safe, efficient and smooth flow of air
traffic.
4.33.(cid:9) Collision Course. If two aircraft are maintaining
same level and are on converging tracks, only then
these could be called as being on collision course.
In the instant case, since vertical separation of
1000 feet had been catered for, the two aircraft
were not on a collision course, though they were on
a reciprocal course.(cid:9) Furthermore, both these
109

aircraft had c:nfirmed cn RT as to be maintaining FL
140 and FL 150 respectively as assigned to them and
thus were expe:ted to be in level flight at the time
of the planned crossing. It may be borne in mind
that, while in level flight, aircraft all over the
world are flying with the standard separations as
specified by ICAO along the same route, in the same
and reciprocal directions.
4.34.(cid:9) Traffic Information.(cid:9)
It was argued by some
parties that the traffic information provided by the
Controller was late, inadequate and incorrect.(cid:9) In
order to understand this issue, we need to refer to
Doc 4444, part III, Section 14.1 which States
"Essential traffic is that controlled traffic to
which thd provision of separation by ATC is
applicable, but which in relation to a particular
controlled flight, is not separated therefrom by the
minima set forth in Section 2 to 9 inclusive of Part
III, Section 3 of Part-IV and Section 6.6. of Part
VI.(cid:9)
Since in this case, both, the aircraft were
instructed to maintain flight levels which were
separated as per Section 3.1 (b) there was no
essential traffic as such, nor there was any colli-
sion hazard expected (as per Section 8.2 of Part-III
110

(cid:9)(cid:9)
information to either of the two was not necessary.
4.34.1(cid:9) Traffic information in this case to Kazak 1907 was
given only as an additional (not essential) input
necessitated in the light of the background of
experience about the frequent inability of the CIS
crew to properly understand the instructions given
in English.(cid:9) It may be borne in mind that this
information was given only after asking Kazak 1907
to maintain FL 150. Furthermore, this information
was given immediately after identifying Kazak 1907
on radar and in the same transmission which started
at 13:09:08.(cid:9) This communication lasted till
13:09:41(cid:9) (until it .was understood by Radio
Operator). Prior to this stage, when the aircraft
was being cleared for continuous descent, this
information was not even relevant.
4.34.2(cid:9) A feeble grievance was made by the Saudi Airlines as
also by the Kazakstan Airlines that, whereas the
controller informed the IL-76 of the reciprocal
traffic at FL 140, similar information was not
supplied to the Saudi. aircraft.(cid:9) As explained
earlier in Para 4.32 passing of the traffic
information by ATC to either of the two aircraft was
111

(cid:9)(cid:9)
neither required nor warranted. Thus, denial of the
same to Saudi aircraft cannot be questioned, whereas
passing of the same to Kaiak 1907 can at least be
appreciated when viewed in the light of para 1.3.4
( Part II Section 3 Chapter' of Doc 9426) which,
inter alia,(cid:9) states "air traffic descending for
approach normally requires more attention from the
controller than other(cid:9) flight(cid:9) phases". Further,
there is nothing to suggest as per the laid down
provisions that in such cases parity had to be
maintained. In any case each aircraft is expected to
listen to all -transmissions on the working
frequency.
4.34.3(cid:9) The Controller's actions in the instant case were
appropriate and as laid down in Doc 4444.
4.35.(cid:9) Why was Saudia 763 not held on ground till Kazak
1907 landed ? One of the basic objectives of ATS is
to expedite and maintain an orderly flow of traffic.
To achieve this, as per the provisions laid down, a
departing aircraft is not held back unless there is
an arriving aircraft within about 4-6 NMs away on
the final approach. When the Saudi aircraft took
off, the IL-76 was about 60 NMs from Delhi airport.
112

(cid:9)
4.35.1.(cid:9) If the contention that Saudi aircraft should have
been held back on the ground until the Kazak
aircraft had(cid:9) landed were to be accepted, neither
Delhi airport would be able to handle about 20
movements per hour nor would London Heathrow be
able to handle over 80 movements per hour. The
suggestion, not being practicable does not find
acceptance..
4.36(cid:9) WHY DID ATC NOT ASK EITHER OR BOTH THE AIRCRAFT
TO EXECUTE MANOEUVERS TO TAKE THEM AWAY FROM EACH
OTHER ? Para 10.1.3 ( Part ii of Doc 4444) brings
out that ATC clearances(cid:9) are - based(cid:9) on(cid:9) known
traffic conditibns which affect safety in aircraft
operation.(cid:9) Further, para 10.2.2,(cid:9) inter alia
states "aircraft arriving and/or departing within
a terminal control area shall, where possible, be
cleared by the most direct route from the point of
entry to the aerodrome of landing or from the
aerodrome of departure to the point of(cid:9) exit. In
the instant case, both the aircraft had been
assigned different levels(cid:9) with standard
separation) and both had confirmed that(cid:9) they
were maintaining assigned levels. Under the
circumstances controller's actions were in
conformity with the above mentioned provisions and
113

(cid:9)(cid:9)
there seemed(cid:9) to be no basis to issue any
instructions to the aircraft other than maintain
their levels.
4.37.(cid:9) SINGLE CORRIDOR 'Single corridors' for entry and
exit exist at many international airports.(cid:9) Entry
and exit of aircraft through a 'single corridor',
when under radar control with provision of
applicable separation minima, do offer adequate
safety, provided the aircraft adhere to the ATC
clearances. Different or larger separation minima
have not been laid down or even recommended by ICAO
for 'single corridor' traffic or for reciprocal
traffic.
4.37.1(cid:9) Laterally separated uni-directional entry and exit
routes are evolved primarily to optimise the
airspace capacity utilisation to meet the increasing
demands and for ensuring smooth flow of traffic. To
that extent it enhances safety and reduces
controller's work load by application of SIDs and
STARs. However, even in such cases, if an aircraft
violates the assigned course and strays to the left
right, a potential collision situation will
ensue. Laterally separated entry and exit routes,
114

or larger vertical separation, are no substitute for
good airmanship. Notwithstanding the above
contention, uni-directional routes are desirable and
should he established wherever possible.
4.37.2.(cid:9) While uni-directional routes provide for in-built
lateral separation the traffic on bi- directional
(single corridor) routes has to be longitudinally
or vertically separated. In the instant case, since
both the flights had been assigned levels separated
vertically by 1000 ft,(cid:9) use of single corridor
cannot be accepted as a contributory factor.
4.37.3 It was brought out by AAI counsel that re-
structuring of certain routes ( including G452, the
route on which the mid-air collision occurred) in
Delhi TMA is already on the anvil as part of the ATC
modernisation project. Having visited Heathrow
Airport and associated(cid:9) London Area and Terminal
Control Centre the Court is of the opinion that
there is an urgent need to emulate the NATS (
National Air Traffic Services) model at least in the
matter cf increasing the traffic handling capacity
at Indian airports which is regrettably low.
4.38.(cid:9) Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR). It was contended
115

on behalf of the Kazak Republic and Airlines as also
the Saudi Airlines that Delhi Airport lacked the
modern secondary radar.(cid:9) The contention, that if
only such a modern radar system were available the
accident might not have occurred, is not correct.
4.38.1(cid:9) In this regard, it may be relevant to refer to Part
I, Section 2, Chapter 9 of Doc 9426 on Advanced ATS
Systems comprising of Primary Surveillance Radar,
Secondary Surveillance Radar and Electronic Data
Processing Equipment. The position regarding their
requirements is summed up in the following Paras
9.1.1 "Apart from adequate and reliable
ground - ground and air-ground
communications; an ATC Unit applying
conventional control methods has
comparatively few requirements for
additional means and equipment.
Experience has shown that if
(cid:9) (cid:9)
controllers received adequate
training and the social and working
(cid:9) (cid:9)
conditions are reasonably
satisfactory, an ATC unit will be
able to handl e appreciable amounts of
air traffic before it would be
necessary to introduce advanced ATS
systems."
9.1.2 While sophisticated equipment will,
as a general rule, assist in
resolving a particularly pressing
problem(cid:9) (primarily(cid:9) capacity
limitations), it is also likely that
its use will create a number of new
problems which, while probably of a
less urgent nature, will nevertheless
require resolution before the full
116

(cid:9)(cid:9)
benefit of the new equipment can be
obtained.(cid:9) It has also been found
that the introduction of such new
equipment does not immediately reduce
manpower requirements.(cid:9) In many
cases, cost savings on the manpower
side, when compared with the increase
in air traffic, can only be made once
the equipment is used close to its
full inherent capacity.
4.38.2(cid:9) Sophisticated equipment like SSR can, as a general
rule, assist in resolving a particularly pressing
problem (primarily of capacity limitations) but can
not by itself guarantee total safety.(cid:9) The
availability of an SSR equipment could not prevent a
mid-air collision between a British Airways Trident
and a DC-9 of INEX ADRIA in Yugoslav airspace over
Zagreb on 10th September, 1976. Nevertheless, such
an aid is useful but not a mandatory requireMent.
The decision on its installation rests with
individual state(s) without any say in the matter by
other states.
4.38.3(cid:9) What really matters is whether availability of such
systems or otherwise is known so as to facilitate
flight planning.(cid:9) Since the availability of
navigational aids, radar systems and other
facilities at Delhi Airport forms part of the
117

published information, it was known to both Kazak
and Saudi crew who(cid:9) should have planned their
flights accordingly. They knew in advance that SSR
was not available at Delhi.(cid:9) Merely because
availability of better aids could possibly have
averted the accident, non-availability of such aids,
if not mandatory, cannot be considered a
circumstance contributing to the accident.
4.38.4 Notwithstanding the above, faced with traffic
handling limitations due to age-old equipment, India
is already in the process of modernising her ATC
system at Delhi, Bombay and some other major
airports. As brought out by AAI counsel, whereas
MSSRs ( Westing hous-e Make) have already become
functional at Trivandrum, Hyderabad, Gauhati ( with
Ahmedabad, Calcutta and Madras to follow) fully
automated primary/secondary radars ( Raytheon Make)
are under installation at Delhi and Bombay. Although
these turnkey projects were(cid:9) conceived nearly a
decade ago; as these require detailed planning in
terms of resources the lead time is considerably
long. The arguments advanced by Kazak side that
India woke up only after the mid air collision are
unfounded. Nevertheless, the accident has drawn,
118

attention to the need to hasten the commissioning of
the systems which the Indian Government needs to
consider with all sincerity.
4.39.(cid:9) ATC workload.(cid:9) Saudi counsel contended that Radar
Controller on the day of the accident was over
worked and this factor might have contributed to the
accident. This argument was denied by AAI counsel.
Notwithstanding the arguments, the Court had already
carried out a thorough examination of various tran-
scripts (ATC tape and inter-com) and come to the
following conclusions :-
(a)(cid:9) The workload of Radar Controller was definitely
excessive.(cid:9) This was due to the fact that
traffic intensity was high and only one
Controller handled both arriving and departing
flights. The system of sectorised controlling
was not yet in vogue due to certain constraints
like manpower as well as equipment.
(b) Despite (a) above, the Radar Controller handled
the traffic situation very confidently and
efficiently.(cid:9) It goes to his credit that even
after the accident, he remained alert and
composed and continued controlling effectively
119

till relieved. Thus, at least on the day of
reckoning,(cid:9) there is nothing to indicate that
the over-work in any way contributed to the
accident.
4.40.(cid:9) ATS Coordination.(cid:9) While referring to the transcript
containing intercom conversation between Area Control
(West) and Approach/Radar it was contended by the
Kazak side that the 'Controllers did not properly
coordinate their actions'. This contention is based
on the premise that both the aircraft which were
expected to cross' each other at about 80 NM. from
Delhi, actually collided at about 40 NM.
4.40.1(cid:9) The plea, to say the least, is based on ignorance of
aviation realities. In the air, actual traffic situa-
tion is constantly changing, therefore the actual
crossing may not occur at the anticipated distance and
time. This anticipation by ATC was, in fact, one of
the steps towards advance planning and coordination.
4.40.2(cid:9) Having scrutinised the transcripts we do not find any
indication of lack of proper Coordination on the part
of Delhi ATC.
4.41(cid:9) We are very clear in our mind that though ATC Delhi is
overloaded with work and there is ample scope for
120

improvement. This did not contribute to the accident.
Finding such faults with ATC has nothing to do with
the cause and circumstances of this accident.
4.42(cid:9) Visit to Delhi ATC by Kazak ATC specialists :- Cbunsel
for Kazak Republic and Airlines made a request for a
visit to Delhi Airport by Kazak ATC specialists for
the purpose of inspection of ATS facilities/procedures
in vogue thereat. This was objected to by AAI counsel.
Though the request for inspection by parties was not
in order yet, to ensure transparency, the parties
desirous of doing so were(cid:9) allowed to visit ATS
'facilities. Kazak Specialists, after their visit to
Delhi ATC, basically commented on three aspects,
namely (i) the typewritten instruction on page 8 of
ASRI Manual, (ii) Procedure regarding investigation of
airmisses and (iii) the state of primary radar at
Delhi Airport.
4.42.1 The 'typewritten instruction'(cid:9) reference was as
follows :
" 12. Radar separation based on primary
radar shall be so applied that the dis-
tance between the centers of radar
blips representing the locations of the
aircraft concerned is never less than 5
NM ( nautical miles).
The team noticed that at the end of this instruction
121

(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)
the following handwritten words had been added but were
.neither signed nor dated.
"Unless(cid:9) vertical(cid:9) separation(cid:9) exists."
4.42.2(cid:9) In their affidavit the Kazak side also stated :
" Although the ASRI Manual provision with the
handwritten notation added does not violate
ICAO standards, in our opinion, the
handwritten notation was an inappropriate
addition in light of all the circumstances
existing at the Delhi airport."
4.42.3(cid:9) On being asked to explain, the AAI has stated
through its counsel that text of the instructions as
circulated was typewritten; the hand written words
were not there. Some one unidentified and(cid:9) not
ascertained has made unauthorised noting of these
words. The addition is neither initialled nor
authenticated by any one. It has to be ignored.
4.42.4(cid:9) The court feels that it is all making mountain of a
mole hill. The handwritten words do not form part of
authentic text. They have to be ignored. They are
superfluous.
4.42.5(cid:9) The air- misses were already being investigated by
higher authorities viz AAI and DGCA. This is in
accordance with recognised procedures. However,
presently there is no system of dissemination of
the outcome of the investigations(cid:9) to the
122

controllers. This needs to be introduced.
Lastly, the primary radar though old was serviceable
4.42.6(cid:9)
on 12.11.96 and necessary calibrations had been
carried out in the past as warranted. AAI is aware
of the situation and modernisation of ATS systems is
already in progress.

CHAPTER IV-2
INCIDENTAL ISSUES
4.43(cid:9)
In order to appreciate the causes and circumstances
leading to the accident, the court made efforts to
familiarise with and(cid:9) study the cockpit layouts of
Boeing 747 and IL-76. Lot of dis-similarities were
observed in the two layouts. Boeing cockpit certainly
presented a higher degree of sophistication in compari-
son to IL-76. This aspect also got highlighted in the
analysis reports of the two investigating agencies,
AAIB and IAC specially with regard to the determination
of the actual altitude at the time of collision. It is
proposed to deal with two important issues which need
attention of the ICAO and the member States.
4.44(cid:9)
Tolerance Values in Altitude Recordings in FDR of IL-76
IAC Moscow initially opined that the tolerance values
in the altitude recordings in FDR of ill fated IL-76
were to the tune of +3%. In the supplementary report
however they concluded that the margin could be -200/
+100 meters of the recorded altitude of 4300 meters at
the time of collision. As against this, AAIB concluded
that in the(cid:9) 3e of IL-76, the tolerance values in the

recorded altitude of 14100 ft ( at the time of colli-
sion) could at best, be + 500 ft. The variations were
thus quite revealing. What is significant, in this case
is that the maximum tolerance of + 200 meters as laid
down in Annexure 6 ( Table Parameters for Flight Data
recorded , Para 2) had been reached only at an altitude
of 4300 meters. What would have happened if the
altiutude of the aircraft were much higher. The Court,
therefore, opines that the technical specifications of
the DFR fitted in the ill-fated(cid:9) IL-76 were not in
conformity with the standards laid down by ICAO.
4.45(cid:9) ON BOARD AVOINOICS :- Modern technology has resulted in
reduced pilot workload termendously and enhanced air
safety. Advanced versions of Boeing, Airbus and some
other similar type of modern day aircraft provide good
examples. There is however a long way to go for many
other types to catch up with these . Notwithstanding
this , if air safety is a concern and the aim, there is
an urgent need to think in terms of certain vital on
board avionics like Airborne collision Avoidance System
(ACAS) also termed as Traffic Collision Avoidance
System (TCAS) and Altitude Alert/Altitude Acquisition
System. Though not made mandatory by ICAO so far the
necessity of such aids is strongly felt. In the instant
125

case, had the IL-76 aircraft been equipped with the
latter, the chances of avoidance of collision would
have been greatly increased provided of course the
language barrier did not exist and the pilot selected
the appropriate level as instructed(cid:9) by ATC. It is
understood that whereas availability of these aids on
public transport aircraft is already made mandatory in
the US airspace, European countries have also
announced similar intentions. Further DGCA ( India)
has made its applicability mandatory with effect from
1.1.1999. Under the circumstances it is for
consideration of the ICAO whether_such steps could be
universally globalised. The flying environment which is
becoming congested day by day will surely become safer
with the adoption of such measures.
4.46(cid:9) During the course of proceedings the court had an
opportunity of studying ATS in Moscow and London and
compare the same with those in India. The court also
gathered information about organisational set up of
aviation institutions/establishments/functionaries in
India and their problems, difficulties and shortcom-
ings. Though unconnected with the accident under in-
quiry, the Court has gone into these matters as they
are ultimately associated with aviation safety in
126

general.
4.47(cid:9) In the field of aviation, flying and ( air traffic)
controlling are the two most important aspects and the
other support services must take only a second place.
-
it is, therefore, necessary that both these activities
being complementary to each other- are offered adequate
opportunities to(cid:9) grow side by side to rise to the
occasion.(cid:9) the case of civil aviation, it is seen
that whereas the government's responsibility towards
provision of Air Traffic Services is total, its role
towards flying is limited to performance of regulatory
functions; the investment in aircraft being left to the
operators ( various airlines) With all good intentions
the Indian Govt adopted open sky policy but the same
has remained lopsided in the sense that it resulted in
mushrooming of airlines thereby bringing about tremen-
dous increase in air traffic without matching additions
to the ATC infrastructure. This has landed us in an
unhealthy situation. The reasons are not difficult to
find. Unfortunately in our country ATC is being treated
like any other service and its true significance is not
recognised. Accordingly, its development has
being(cid:9)
been far from satisfactory. The Court has formed this
opinion by comparing it with that existing in UK,
Russia and USA, Whereas India may not succeed in
•127

achieving similar standards ( for want of resources) as
prevalent in these countries,. there is no harm in
borrowing their concepts and learning from their ex-
periences. There is no denying the fact that for the
proper growth of civil aviation in the country, the ATC
has to be given a special place in the scheme of things
or else the country will continue to lag behind. India
needs to aim to achieve the traffic handling capacity
of over 80 movements per hour ( which prevails at
Heathrow) as against Delhi's present rate of about 12-
15 movements ( likely to go up to about 30-35 even
after(cid:9) commissioning of Raytheon system). In this
Chapter the Court has also made an effort to draw the
attention of the Govt of India towards the inadequacies
in the field of ATC. The Govt would be well advised to
take due notice of these shortcomings and endeavour to
make up the deficiencies.
4.48(cid:9) The Court proposes to place on record its view point
and observations on the following aspects related to
provision of Air Traffic Services in India and related
matters.
4.49(cid:9) Organisational Set-up
4.49.1(cid:9) Till early 70s DGCA had been the only government agency
charged with the responsibility of promotion of civil
aviation in the country(cid:9) including provision of 'Air
128

Traffic services in the Indian air space. In 1973, part
of this responsibility was transferred to Internation-
(cid:9)
al Airports Authority of India, a new organisation
(cid:9)
created to look after the infrastructure mainly at
four international airports but provision of ATS re-
mained with the DGCA. In 1986, National Airports Au-
thority was born, which was handed over the control of
all domestic airports along with the responsibility of
providing Air Traffic Services including control of
Indian air space. Lastly with effect from 1.4.95 the
(cid:9)
latter two agencies have merged into one to form
Airports Authority of India (AAI) with national and
international divisions.
4.49.2(cid:9) It is thus evident that in the organizational set up
of civil aviation, changes have been too frequent and
the Govt have not been able to evolve a long term
aviation policy which is badly needed for proper growth
of the aviation industry in the country. Further as far
as ATC is concerned, DGCA's(cid:9) role has become quite
limited and the entire responsibility stands trans-
ferred to AAI, an autonomous body. Ironically, DGCA
does not even have any ATC element on its strength and
is thus seriously constrained in overseeing the ATC
functions of AAI. This arrangement does not appear to
129

(cid:9)(cid:9)
be in consonance with the obligation of meeting statu-
tory requirement of the country as a contracting State
of ICAO. In this regard, reference may be had to Part
IV Section 1 Chapter 1 of the ICAO DOC 9426 ( Organisa-
tion of Air Traffic Services). Paras 1.2.1 AND 1.2.2
read as follows:
1.2.1.(cid:9) A civil aviation administration is
charged with the responsibility for promoting
and supervising the development of civil
aviation in the State concerned while, at the
same time, fostering safety, achieving the
efficient use of navigable airspace, and devel-
oping and operating a satisfactory air
navigation system.
1.2.2.(cid:9) The director of civil aviation issues
and enforces rules, regulations and minimum
Standards relating to the operation of aircraft,
the licensing and rating of personnel including
the supervision and enforcement of medical
standards, the operations specifications for
commercial air operations, the surveillance of
air operations, the operation of the air
navigation system and the provision of ATS.
4.49.3 Accepting that AAI has now been made responsible
for the provision, promotion and efficiency of ATS it
is considered desirable to examine its organisational
set up with regard to ATC. In this organisation, the
highest post which an ATC professional can fill up is
that of Executive Director ( Air Traffic Management)
who is placed under Member (Operations) who in turn
reports to the Chairman, the Head of the Organisation.
130

(cid:9)
InterestLag1y, Member ( Operations) need not be an ATC
professfroal. Thus, operationally ED ( ATM) does not
ever_ have direct access to the Chairman which is quite
necessarT. Thus in the hierarchical set up, this im-
portamt 11mb ( it may be proper to term it as the most
importam: operational element) is not adequately repre-
sented.
4.49.4(cid:9) Reference may be had to Part III Section 1 Chapter(cid:9) 1 of
ICAC DOC 9426- Organisation of Air Traffic Services
Paras 1.1.3 and 1.1.4 read as follows :
1.1.3(cid:9) It is generally accepted that
ii the organisation of the ATS, there will
be a section of the Central or Headquarters
athiinistration responsible for the over-all
pcLicy, planning, personnel and budgetary
ma=agement of ATS.(cid:9) This Section should
hale a(cid:9) high enough(cid:9) ranking in the
Government hierarchy to assure that an
editable share of the total resources
available are assigned to ATS (i.e. money
ari people) and that the importance of the
rcle of ATS in the determination of the
overall priorities and policies of the
administration is recognised.
1.:.4(cid:9) A regional organization may be
a part of the ATS structure, although
operating semi-independently in the
prcvision of day-to-day service.(cid:9) Such a
delegation of functional responsibility to
the field by Headquarters allows individual
AT: units to be grouped under a common
rezional management.(cid:9) These units may
c,uiprise Area Control Centres (ACCs),
ap.zroach Control Offices (APPs) and
aerodrome control towers, and their task is
tc provide ATS at the operational level 'and
131

within a geographical region.
4.49.5(cid:9) It thus follows that ATC should not only be well
represented at HQ level but also be in a
commanding position at the regional level and
downwards. Unfortunately, it is not-so in the
existing organisational set up of AAI. It may be
relevant to point out here that ATCCs ( Compris-
ing ACCs, FICs and RCCs) are purely ATS units
which need to be headed by ATS Professionals.
Placing these units under technical heads who
are, in fact, required to provide and maintain
necessary equipment/ infrastructure to support
ATC is bound to lead to deterioration in main-
tenance standards and delays in the installation
of new facilities. For effective and efficient
functioning of ATS the user ( ATC) must not be
subordinated to the provider or else there will
be compromises. In UK and Russia, where the court
was able to visit London ATCC and Moscow ATCC
respectively the aspect highlighted(cid:9) above is
well taken care of. There is therefore a strong
need to have a re-look at the system in India and
re-organise the same to accord proper recognition
to ATC. Creating an independent ATS organisation
132

(cid:9)(cid:9)
on the pattern of NATS in UK could be the answer.
4.50(cid:9) COORDINATION WITH THE MILITARY
4.50.1(cid:9) The court made efforts to compare ATC system in
India with those prevailing in advanced countries
like UK, USA and Russia. Whereas visits to London
and Moscow ATCC provided a direct insight into
their working and systems, knowledge about USA is
obtained from ICAO DOC 9426.
4.50.2(cid:9) Before proceeding further it may be relevant to
comment on the important aspect of civil/military
coordination in aviation as it exists in India.
There are two major users of the airspace ( to be
rightly termed as national resource) viz AAI and
IAF. Both of these independently provide ATS
within their assigned areas of jurisdiction and
have gone ahead in creating necessary
infrastructure(cid:9) guided(cid:9) by(cid:9) their(cid:9) own
considerations. In most of the cases the facili-
ties have been duplicated and their uses are
often denied by one to the other party. It is a
pity that both the organisations have been work-
ing in water-tight compartments; one trying to
establish supremacy over the other. This lacuna
133

had been highlighted by Tata Committee, which was
appointed to review the civil aviation set-up in
the country subsequent to a Boeing crash at Palam
in 1971 wherein it was strongly recommended that
the country should adopt an integrated
civil/military ATC set up on the pattern of NATS
as prevalent in UK. Even after lapse of nearly
25 years, India is yet to make any headway in
this direction. In fact , in spite of the
national awakening leading to establishment of an
Expert Group to adopt an integrated approach,.
it was painful to observe that in the new ATC
complex, the IAF element has still been kept
totally isolated. In fact, in the present set up
there is no IAF ATC element co-located alongside
ACCS/FICs except at Delhi where though a small
liaison cell exists but is not performing any
ATC functions.
4.50.3(cid:9) The IAF air defence units (MLUs) co-located with
ACCS/FICs have altogether a different role to
perform and cannot do justice as far as ATC
coordination is concerned. Further, IAF at pres-
ent having nearly 50 per cent of national air-
space under its control is reluctant to part with
134

it for the growth of civil aviation.
4.50.4(cid:9) Such lacunae clearly point towards lack of de-
sired civil/military coordination. Reference may
be had to Part II Section 1 Chapter 2 of ICAO DOC
9426 on Coordination with Military ( relevant
paras reproduced below )
2.2.1. Rapid changes in the sophistication
and the performance characteristics of both
civil and military aircraft in the early
1950s, accompanied by the construction of
major civil and military airfields, and the
organization of the airspace into a network
of airways, terminal areas and control
zones, resulted in more or less significant
restrictions on the freedom of movement by
military aircraft.(cid:9) On the one hand, the
civil operators demanded safeguard of their
aircraft by the rigid application of separa-
tion standards whilst the military
authorities required the fullest amount of
tactical freedom and flexibility in the
conduct of their flight operations;
2.2.3 Considerable differences exist in
regard to the role which military aviation
is required to play in any particular State.
The methods by which civil-military co-
ordination is accomplished in respective ATS
organizations is left to the determination
of the individual States. However, in order
to understand the problem, it is necessary
to consider the civil requirements for
airspace in all three dimensions and relate
theSe requirements to the environment in
which the military need to conduct their
operations.(cid:9) The resultant sharing of the
airspace must therefore be made in such a
manner that military operations do not
constitute a hazard to the safe conduct of
135

civil flights.(cid:9) A national co-ordinating
organisation is often established to meet
these sometimes opposing objectives.
2.2.5 The task of a co-ordinating
committee is to develop national ATS rules
and(cid:9) procedures(cid:9) for(cid:9) approval(cid:9) and
implementation by the respective civil and
military authorities.(cid:9) The manner of
achieving such rules and procedures is
suggested by the following guidelines :
a) procedures should, whenever possible
conform to the civil aviation rules and
regulations developed by ICAO or the
State concerned;
b) aeronautical facilities and ground
services required for civil or military
use should be provided jointly or on, a
common, integrated basis;
c) personnel in civil and military ATS
units should be required to meet equal
standards in training and rating, based
on applicable ICAO provisions;
d) neither the military nor the civil
authority should unilaterally establish
controlled and/or reserved or restricted
airspace;
e) duplication of effort in research
and development as well as in practical
operations should be avoided and ground
facilities, equipment and services should
be shared whenever practical.
2.2.7 The practical application on
civil/military co-ordination is based on the
philosophy that the greatest degree of
safety and efficiency in the utilisation of
airspace is achieved when civil and military
air traffic are integrated in a common
system, and all aircraft within national
airspace are subject to common rules of the
air and ATC procedures. However, it must be
recognised that there will be occasions when
civil and military requirements are
136

incompatible(cid:9) and(cid:9) special(cid:9) airspace
arrangements are necessary.(cid:9) Depending on
the significance of either the civil or the
military(cid:9) requirements,(cid:9) practical(cid:9) co-
ordination(cid:9) can(cid:9) range(cid:9) from(cid:9) simple
arrangements to circumstances whereby signif-
icant(cid:9) and(cid:9) sophisticated(cid:9) military
requirements must be accommodated.
2.2.8. In some States, it is common
practice for military personnel to be
attached to civil ATC units where they are
employed in both operational and procedural
positions and are also involved in areas
such as research and development and airways
planning. As all ATC procedures must per se
be fully co-ordinated with the military
authorities before adoption, the involvement
of military personnel in the activities, as
both users and providers is essential.
4.50.5(cid:9) SYSTEM IN MOSCOW ATCC. The Centre is located away
from the Moscow airport and houses Area Control,
Approach Control and Flow Control Centres besides
a Simulator with large scale training capacity.
The entrance to the Area Control Centre is con-
spicuous by way of large number of workstations
which are manned by Air Force Air Traffic and Air
Defence Controllers. Just adjacent to that, there
are other work stations, which are manned by '
civil controllers. The co-locations of civil and
military controllers without any barrierr ,
provides a good degree of coordination between
the two. The Centre is headed by an ATC Profes-
sional with the designation of a Director.
137

4.50.6(cid:9) BYSTEM IN UK ( LONDON ) ATCC. The Court was
highly impressed with the system prevailing in
London ATCC at West Drayton. The center
compried of two main wings, one manned
exclusively by the military (RAF) Controllers,
and the other, manned jointly by civil and
military controllers working side by side.
Whereas civil wing provided services in and
exercised jurisdiction over controlled airspace,
the military wing did so in respect of uncon-
trolled airspace irrespective of the traffic
flying therein. In addition the military wing (
Distress centre) was responsible for search and
rescue of both civil and military traffic in the
entire airspace of the country. By and large the
resources ( equipment) being made use of were
common. The system appeared to be one of the best
examples of civil/military coordination. The
centre is headed by an ATC professional with the
designation of a Director. Smooth and efficient
functioning of ATC was the hallmark of NATS.
4.50.7(cid:9) Further the situation pertaining to this aspect
in USA is summed up in Appendix-A [Civil/Mili-
tary coordination of ATC in USA ] of part II
138

Section 1 Chapter 2, of DOC 9426 ( Paras 1,2 and
10 reproduced)
"1 As early as 1945 in the United States, a
policy for the development of a
civil/military ATC system along common lines
was determined and resulted in the formation
of the Air Coordinating Committee with the
object of achieving an integrated and
coordinated federal aviation policy.
2. The need for common system was expressed
in the following excerpts from Air
Coordinating Committees civil Air Policy
The national interest dictates that a
single, integrated system of air navigation
and traffic control be developed and
maintained so as to permit the efficiency in
the use of modern aircraft capabilities
required for defence, economy and the safety
of persons and property.
The single air navigation and traffic
control must
(a) satisfy the basic requirements of all
civil and military' operations ( excluding
special military needs(cid:9) peculiar to
airwar fare);
(b) assure safe and reliable operation
under all prevalent conditions;
(c) ,be capable of immediate integration
of air defence system of the United
States.
There is a need to provide for safety and
efficiency in civil operations while
simultaneously meeting military demand
for mobility, flexibility, speed of
operational handling and a system capable
of integration within the continental air
defence network.(cid:9) It shall be the
continuing policy of the United'States to
139

(a) provide for a single national common
civil, military system of air navigation
and air traffic control. The national
integrated system shall satisfy the'air
navigation and air traffic control
requirements of all civil and military
air operations, except for those special
military requirements peculiar to air
warfare;
(b) provide a common system that shall
be capable of immediate integration with
air defence system of the United States
and will constitute and auxiliary to the
air defence network;
(c) provide for an accelerated joint
civil/military programme of research and
development to keep the system abreast of
current and forceable future operational
requirements;
(d) accelerate the transition to the most
advanced concept of this common system.
10 Through cooperation of civil and military
authorities, approx. 85 per cent of country's
airspace (over land) has been designated joint
user airspace. In joint use airspace, ATC may
authorise operations, thus making this
airspace available to other users at times
when its reservation for the designated
military use is not necessary. "
4.50.8(cid:9) It is felt that the prevalent ATC systems in the
abovementioned advanced countries have stood the
test of time and India needs to go in for an in-
tegrated approacn without further loss of time.
Had it been done that earlier, the civil ATC at
Palam could have advantageously used the SSR
facility located in the close proximity at Air
140

Force Station Arjangarh, thereby affording an
opportunity to the controller to alert the erring
pilot for a possible corrective action in this
accident. There is no denying the fact that an
integrated set up will surely be economical due
to avoidance of duplication of resources and will
also promote efficiency and air safety by way of
optimum use of air space; hence the same would be
very much in national interest.
4.51.(cid:9) PECULIAR ROLE OF ATC
4.51.1 Prompted by media reports making adverse comments
on ATC profession and a strike threat on 28.3.97
by ATC Guild of India followed by actual strike
on 3.4.97 paralysing the entire domestic/interna-
tional flights, the Court made efforts to get at
the causes leading to such situations.-It is felt
that the profession does not enjoy due recogni-
tion and the respect it deserves. This is prob-
ably the root cause which is leading to discon-
tentment among the air traffic controllers'. The
ATC job in present day environment is highly
specialised and complex and demands utmost dedi-
cation. The personnel employed on these duties,
therefore, need special consideration in all
141

(cid:9)(cid:9)
respects.(cid:9) It goes without saying that whereas
the responsibility of a pilot-in-command is
limited to the safety of his aircraft and pas-
sengers on board thereon, that of the controller
extends to all the aircraft (and passengers)
under his control at any given time. Reference
may be made to Part-IV Section 1 Chapter 2 of
ICAO Doc 9426-ATC's Role in the Civil Service
(relevant(cid:9) paras(cid:9) reproduced(cid:9) below)--
2.4.2.1(cid:9) It is generally recognised that ATS
does not easily fit into the civil service
because of its involvement in public safety
and the essentiality of ATS in respect of
public air transport. As a result, ATS per-
sonnel have found that their industrial bar-
gaining position is different from that of
most other civil services. To avoid constant
confrontation, ATS management and employee
committees should be formed so that problems
can be aired as they arise. Access by em-
ployee representatives to senior management
should not only be accepted but should be
actively encouraged when safety is claimed to
be the basis of unrest.
2.4.2.2(cid:9) It is usual for government organi-
zations to have a standard code for personnel
conditions which include the working area per
person, furniture, floor coverings and other
similar items. Such a code does not usually
satisfy the ATS working requirements. Admin-
istrative action is therefore necessary to
exempt ATS planners from adhering to standard
codes where the operational requirement can
justify specialised treatment.(cid:9) Areas of
obvious conflict arise in the design of public
offices vis-a-vis ATC operational rooms such
as the need for the latter to have a higher
ceiling height, special lighting, special
142

acoustic treatment such as noise absorbent
floors and ceilings, and the need for more
efficient ventilation, heating and Cooling
than usual. To avoid such conflict, consider-
ation should be given to consulting working
environment specialists in those cases where
the environment has an influence on the oper-
ating capacity of persotinel concerned (i.e.
use of radar and/or video displays).
2.4.4.3.(cid:9) Because it is usually very diffi-
cult for ATS personnel to transfer to, or gain
promotion in other disciplines of the civil
service, controllers tend to group together in
specialised associations and seek affiliation
on an international scale.(cid:9) Experience indi-
cates that the civil service and management
should not object to such affiliations to
ensure industrial harmony. On the whole, ATS
personnel are singularly dedicated to their
task and a State may have much to gain from
the knowledge which flows from international
communication. From time to time administra-
tions may therefore be confronted with re-
quests to support participation by elected ATS
representatives at safety symposia dealing
with ATS matters.(cid:9) Jn general terms, the
administration may be well advised to give
favorable consideration and limited support to
justified requests, on an ad hoc basis, in
order to preserve good labour relations and
offer educational opportunities to its ATS
personnel.
2.4.3.(cid:9) International aspects of service
conditions Known differences in the industrial
legislation in neighboring Stat's often make
it likely that the terms and conditions of
employment will also differ considerably for
ATS personnel performing identical duties. In
the course of familiarisation visits between
units, it is inevitable that these matters
will be discussed, which may give rise to
industrial unrest. However, in the formula-
tion of terms and conditions of service there
are many considerations(cid:9) to be taken into
account before any realistic conclusions can
143

be drawn, e.g. the cost of living factor may
vary considerably between neighbouring States.
ATS personnel have shown themselves to be very
aware of their industrial surroundings.
Therefore ATS management should take steps to
keep abreast of conditions and significant
changes in conditions in adjoining States and
with the assistance of qualified industrial
and economic advisers, endeavor to quantify
the variations in employment conditions and
keep their staff fully informed.
4.51.2(cid:9) From the foregoing, it is thus evident that ATC is
a unique job and its comparison with any other is
uncalled for.(cid:9) It needs an identity of its own.
Once that'is accepted in principle, the disputes
arising between the ATC Guild (India) and the
authorities (Govt/AAI) could be amicably settled.
In this regard, the Court is inclined to suggest
de-linking of ATS from the normal organisational
set-up and create an independent ATS structure , to
be governed by altogether different terms and
conditions.
4.52(cid:9) WORKING ENVIRONMENT AT DELHI ATC :
4.52.1 Relevant information on this aspect has already
been complied and kept separately in the records.
DGCA/AAI would do well to peruse the same.
4.52.2(cid:9) In the present complex whereas there was no radar
144

equipment in the Area Control Centre ( Air Route
Surveillance Radar had been withdrawn w.e.f. 2nd
February, 1996), the approach controller relied
only on an age-old /outdated Airport Surveillance
Radar ( ASR ) with a limited range of about 60 NM.
The letter being firnt generation radar imponon
severe strain on the controller's eyes. Availabil-
ity and state of maintenance of other equipment
also were not upto the desired standard. All this
combined with cramped layout of various control
positions presented an unhealthy working environ-
ment. Dialogue with some of the controllers on
duty indicated that the working relationship
between ATC and communications was not conducive
to smooth functioning of ATC. The modernisation of
ATC had taken too long to materialise. This coul
be attributed to the fact that because of the
existing organisational structure, ATC personnel
did not have proper say in the matter. It was
painful to note that in the process of acquisition
of SSR, civil aviation, which should have, in
fact, taken the lead, was lagging behind even the
IAF by at least a decade.
4.52.3(cid:9) Inadequacy of proper equipment adversely affect-
145

ed traffic handling capacity of ATC, which was, in
addition, plagued due to shortage of man-power. At
any given time. there was only one radar con-
troller performing the functions of(cid:9) approach
controller; this leads to overwork and undue
fatigue.
4.52.4(cid:9) A look at the new ATC complex is to some extent,
a matter of satisfaction in the sense that current
generation radar ( both SSR and PSR) good communi-
cations network and automation will provide a
quantum jump towards improvement of controlling
techniques, thereby leading to about two to three
times increase in traffic handling capacity. This
would, however, be possible only if the ATC man-
power ( officer cadre) is adequately augmented so
as to change over to sectorisation(cid:9) method of
controlling.
4.52.5 In the new complex there is also a need to re-
organise the working space as some of the opera-
tional activities like ATC simulator, co-location
of approach and area control leading to congestion
and increased noise level and IAF elements defi-
nitely need to ease out. Further it is felt that
146

(cid:9)(cid:9)
in view of the ensuing increase in air traffic due
to open sky policy of the Govt, a few more work
stations in Approach and Area Control Centres may
be planned right now to avoid congestion, which is
likely to be experienced soon.
4.53. ATS Licences and Ratings
4.53.1 Part IV Section 1 Chapter 4 of ICAO DOC 9426 deals
with ATS licences and ratings. (Relevant paras
reproduced).
4.1.1(cid:9) Standardization of procedures and
methods regarding the recruitment, training,
performance and, where required, licensing of
air traffic services (ATS) personal is
essential in a service which has
international obligations and uses procedures
involving more than one unit. The degree of
standardization achieved is directly related
to the proficiency with which individuals
perform their duties. This condition in turn
determines the efficiency of the service
given to the users and to the travelling
public.
4.1.2(cid:9) Individual proficiency is attained
and maintained by a programme of training,
proficiency evaluation checks and routine
assessments, and most essentially, by the
deliberate and conscientious efforts of all
ATS personal.
4.1.3(cid:9) While it is recognised that State
employees may operate as air traffic
controllers without a licence, provided they
meet the retirements for this profession set
out in Annex I- Personnel Licensing, it has
nevertheless been found that most States
prefer to issue such licenses even to their
147

State employees acting in this capacity. This
is mainly due to the fact that it has been
recognised that this will assist in
maintaining the level of confidence required
to ensure collaboration between ground
services and operator and/or pilots under the
best possible terms, especially when such
collaboration involves persons of different
nationalities, background and mentalities. It
is for this reason that the material
presented hereafter has been based on the
assumption that States are applying the
practice of issuing personal licenses and
ratings to each person required to act as an
air traffic controller.
Whereas the system of ratings has been adopted by
AAI and is in vogue, no steps have so far been taken
towards licensing of ATCOs . This is in spite of the
fact that the requirement had been clearly brought
out by an earlier Court of Inquiry headed by Hon'ble
Mr Justice U.C. Banerjee of Calcutta High Court who
inquired into Indian Airlines Boeing-747 crash on
16.8.91 near Imphal ( Manipur) and the recommendation
had been accepted by the Govt. Under the
circumstances, it is felt necessary to(cid:9) reiterate
that there is an urgently need to introduce(cid:9) the
scheme of ATS licensing and extend the same to IAF
also so as to bring both the civil and military ATCs
under the same aambit.
At present, the IAF follows the scheme of cate-

categorisation of ATS personnel which is at
variance 1.744'h the scheme of ratings. Since IAF ATS
personal are handling civil traffic at their
aerodromes, there is a strong need to adopt uniform
standards. It is because of this anomaly that the
national contingency plan aimed to induct IAF ATC
officers in the event of a strike by civil
controllers has neither been a success in the past
nor likely to be so in the future. The Govt would
therefore be well advised to introduce the scheme of
ATS licensing without any further delay.
4.54(cid:9) Accident/Incident Prevention
4.54.1(cid:9) 'Prevention is better than cure.' To lay greater
emphasis on the preventive measures it is better to
devise a system of continuous learning based on in-
service experience and deficiencies observed during
periodic inspections, spot checks, safety audits etc.
This can be achieved by having an adequately staffed
Accident/Incident Prevention Directorate in the DGCA
which could propagate this activity amongst various
agencies in civil aviation, namely, operators,
Airport Authority, Maintenance Organisations, Fuel
Vendors etc. Recommendations have been made in this
regard by some of the Courts of Inquiry to have such
149

a set-up in the DGCA. One of the Courts ( Justice
U.C. Banerjee ) in 1992 had recommended :-
`One-man Accident Prevention Cell cur-
rently existing in DGCA is totally
inadequate to ditcharge the vital role
of accident prevention and as such it
should be restructured and strengthened
without any loss of time °
The recommendation though accepted is yet to be
implemented. The need of establishing an adequate-
ly staffed full -fledged Accident/Incident Preven-
tion Directorate in the DGCA so as to enhance the
level of safety in Civil Aviation in India is
emphasised and reiterated.

CHAPTER
-V
Findings
Report of Court of Inquiry on Mid-Air Collision on 12-11-1996
between Saudi Arabian HBoeing 747 & Kazak IL-76
at Charkhi-Dadri, Haryana ( India)

CHAPTER V .
FINDINGS
5.1(cid:9)
EAPJA_DOt in_CgatrA9Set'SY
The following factual details are either not in
dispute or have been well established (Chapter II):
(a)(cid:9) The Kazakstan aircraft Ilyushin IL-76 TD No-
UN-76435 was owned by the Shymkent Avia
Kazakstan, a sister concern and subsidiary of
Kazakhstan Airlines. The aircraft was on a
non-scheduled chartered flight from Chimkent
to Delhi on 12.11.1996.
(1)) The IL-76 aircraft had a certificate of
airworthiness issued by the Republic of
Kazakhstan, valid upto 31-7-1997.
(c) The IL-76 aircraft took off from Chimkent on
12.11.96 at 10.25 UTC for Delhi. The flying
time was about 3 hrs. There were 37 persons on
board, including 5 cockpit crew and five cabin
crew.
(d) The IL-76 aircraft was under the command of
Capt. Alexander Rohertovich Cherepanov ( PIC).
The necond pilot wan Ritiwk Kor.hahmetovinh
151

Dzhanbaev (P2),In addition,(cid:9) there were a
Flight Engineer(FE), Navigator (N) and a Radio
Operator (R) as part of the cockpit crew. All
of them had respective licenses.
(e) The IL-76 aircraft came in first contact with
Delhi Approach at 13.04.55 and reported
passing FL230 and 74 miles from DPN ( Delhi).
As per AAIB-DFDR time ( page 00213) this
transmission was 315.1 sec before collision
that is to say 13.05.01 ( IAC time). The IL-76
was cleared by the Delhi Approach to descend
to FL 150 AT 13.05.06 and(cid:9) this(cid:9) was
acknowledged by the aircraft at 13.05.16 five
minutes before collision.
(f) At 13.08.54 the D-APP asked the IL-76 for the
distance from DPN and the aircraft responded
at 13.08.59 "Kazak-1907, now reached one five
zero, four six miles from Delta Papa November
(DPN)-, Radial two seven zero."As per AAIB-
DFDR recordings the IL-76 was, however, at
about 16439 ft at 13.08.59 ( 77 secs before
collision).
(g) From 13.08.69 to 13.09.41 the IL-76 and the D-
APP were in continuous two-way contact, during
which time D-APP asked the IL-76 to maintain
152

FL 150 which the aircraft acknowledged. The
D-APP also informed the IL-76 of the
reciprocal Saudi Boeing at FL 140. In response
to the D-APP asking the IL-76 to report if the
Boeing is in sight, the IL-76 responded at
13.09.41,(cid:9)
" Now looking 1907". This was the
last transmission from the IL-76 to the ATC.
(h) The entire communication from the IL-76
aircraft to the ATC was by the Radio Operator
and it was in English.
(i) The Saudi Boeing-747 aircraft HZ-AIH belonged
to the Saudi Arabian Airlines. The aircraft
was of 1982 manufacture and was airworthy as
per certifications.
(j) The Saudi Boeing-747 was on a scheduled flight
from Delhi to Dahran and took off from IGI
Airport Delhi at 13.03 UTC on 12.11.96. There
were 312 persons on board including 3 cockpit
crew and 20 cabin crew.
(k) The Saudi Boeing-747 was under the command of
Capt Khalid A Al-Shubaily (PIC) and the first
officer was Nazir Khan (P2). The third
member
153

of the cockpit crew was the Flight
Engineer(FE). All the crew members had
respective licenses.
(I)(cid:9) The Boeing got airborne at 13.08.50 (AAIB-DFDR
time) corresponding to 1303 ATC time. On
departure the aircraft was identified on radar
and thereafter remained under the control of
Delhi Approach Control.
(m) Initially the Boeing was cleared by ATC to
climb to FL 100 and at 13:06:13 the aircraft
was cleared(cid:9) to(cid:9) climb(cid:9) to(cid:9) FL 140. The
aircraft reported approaching FL140 at
13:08:41 and the ATC asked the aircraft at
13:08:44 to maintain FL 140, and standby for
higher. At 13:08:52 the Saudi Boeing
acknowledged Saudi seven six three ( will)
maintain one four zero" ( AAIB Report page
00216). This was the last transmission from
the Saudi aircraft to the ATC.
(n) Neither in the CVR nor in the DFDR of both the
aircraft is there any indication or evidence
of any evasive or avoidance action having been
154

taken by the respective crew. During the
entire period when the Delhi ATC was in
contact with the two aircraft there has been
no transmission from either of the aircraft to
the ATC of any abnormality observed or of any
real/anticipated emergency.
(o) The two aircraft collided at about 14000 ft
level and at 13.10.16 UTC ( IAC Moscow Report)
time.
(p) There were no survivors. There was no casualty
on the ground.
(q) Both the aircraft disintegrated in the air
after the collision and caught fire.
The wreckage was found spread in a trail of 7
Kms, 2 Kms wide, about 40 NM away west of IGI
Airport, Delhi.
(s) Rescue action was initiated immediately by the
local police and the civil authorities and
this was followed by the rescue teams from
Delhi.
(t) All Navigation aids and communication
equipment at the IGI airport were serviceable
at the relevant time on 12.11.1996.
155

5.2(cid:9) Findings as to Main Issues
Based on the material available and its
appreciation the Court arrives at the following
findings :-
(a) The Mid-air Collision was not caused (directly
or indirectly) by sabotage, internal explosion
or by any cause external to the crew or the
aircraft.
(b) The accident was not caused by any mechanical
failure or mechanical defect of any of the two
aircraft.
(c) Both the aircraft were fully airworthy and free
from any mechanical/technical defect.
(d) The two aircraft collided at flight level 140
(i.e. 14,000 feet). (Para 4.10)
(e) The Saudia B-747 had been assigned FL-140 wher-
eas the Kazak IL-76 was assigned FL-150 for'a
safe crossing on the reciprocal tracks.
(Appendix D)
(f) Vertical separation of 1,000 feet for the cross-
ing of the two aircraft as assigned by the Delhi
Air Traffic Control was adequate and met the
156

ICAO standards of safety.( Para 4.32)
(g) The Saudi Aircraft meticulously maintained FL
140. ( Appendices B-2(T), C-3 and D)
(h) The Kazak Aircraft descended to FL-140 (depart-
ing from the assigned FL-150) just prior to the
anticipated crossing. ( Appendices B-2(T), C-3
and D)
(i) The root and approximate cause of the collision
was the unauthorised descending by the Kazak
aircraft to FL-140 and failure to maintain the
assigned FL-150. ( Para 4.22)
(j) The factors contributing to the unauthorised
descent of Kazak aircraft to FL-140, departing
from the assigned FL-150, were ( Para 4.22) :-
(i) inadequate knowledge of English lan-
guage of Kazak pilot, resulting in wrong
interpretations of ATC instructions.
(ii) poor airmanship and lack of proper
CRM (Crew Resource Management) skill on
the part of PIC (pilot in command) com-
pounded by leadership quality lacking in
him
(iii) casual attitude of the crew and lack
of coordination in the performance of
157

(cid:9)
their respective duties by crew of Kazak
air craft.
iv)(cid:9) Absence of standard call-outs from
any crew member.
( NB :- Crew Resource Management(cid:9) includes crew
coordination, (cid:9) situational(cid:9) awareness,
quality of leadership, intra crew communi-
cation-
(k)(cid:9) Nearly 30 seconds before collision both the
aircraft had entered a cloud layer and ex-
perienced turbulence of weak to moderate
intensity.(cid:9) The presence of the cloud did
result in reduced visibility conditions. But
the cloud did not cause any such severe
turbulence as to result in an abrupt loss of
altitude to the extent of 1000 ft. pertaining
to the level of Kazak aircraft. ( Para 4.26)
(1)(cid:9) ATC instructions to both the aircraft were
clear and proper, and in accordance with
established procedures. ( Para 4.32)
Direct pilot-controller communication was not
(m)
established by Kazak 1907 with Delhi ATC.
(Para 4.20)
(n) Presently SSR is not available at Delhi
158

airport. However, installation of current
generation radar ( both primary and second-
ary) along with other ATC automated systems
is already in progress. ( Para 4.38 )
(o) Single air corridor ( bi-directional ATS
route) at Delhi airport was not a
contributory factor for accident. However,
availability of uni-directional routes does
enhance ATC's(cid:9) traffic handling capacity,
which is in the national interest.( Para
4.37.3)
(p) Outcome of the investigation by DGCA/AAI into
airmiss incidents is not being disseminated
to the air traffic controllers from the
training point of view.( Para 4.42.5 )
5.3(cid:9) Findings as to Incidental issues
(a) Altitude parameter accuracy limits in

(i) Altitude Alert System, and
(ii) Altitude Acquisition System.
(d) In the organisational set-up of DGCA (
India) there is no ATC element to oversee ATC
aspects which presently fall under the pur-
view of Airports Authority of India ( AAI)
(Para 4.44)
(e) In the organisational set-up of AAI, the
highest post which an ATC professional can
fill up is that of Executive Director ) (Air
Traffic Management) which arrangement is not
adequate. ( Para 4.50)
(f) Present system of civil/military ATC
coordination in India. Suffers from Serious
short-comings, which adversely affect air
safety in India. ( Para 4.50)
(g) In India, the ATC profession, which has
become highly specialized due to the present
day complex flying environment, does not
enjoy the recognition and status it deserves.
(h) (i)working conditions at Delhi Airport

160

desired standards. ( Para 4.52 )
(ii) Working space in the new complex
specially with regard to Area/Approach
Control, ATC Simulaor and IAF element is no
adequate to mach their functions.

increase in air traffic, the present
number of work stations is not
considered adequate.( Para 4.52.5 )
(i) In India, there is no system of licenc-
ing(cid:9) of air traffic controllers. Also the
proficiency standards which are being fol-

CHAPTER-VI
Recommendations
Report of Court of Inquiry on Mid-Air Collision on 12-11-1996
between Saudi Arabian HBoeing 747 & Kazak IL-76
at Charkhi-Dadri, Haryana ( India)

CHAPTER VI
RECOMMENDATIONS
6.1.(cid:9) The requirement of proficiency in English,
which is the language accepted by ICAO for radio
communications on international flights,(cid:9) should be
'strictly ensured by contracting States.(cid:9) ICAO should
devise ways and means to ensure such compliance by
contracting States so as to avoid lapses on their part.
6.2.(cid:9) Meaningful Crew Resource Management
Programme should be made , an integral part of crew
training curriculum with special emphasis laid on the
importance of standard call-outs and its efficacy be
evaluated during periodic licence renewal checks.
6.3.(cid:9) Before a pilot is appointed as "pilot-in-
command" his having acquired effective CRM skill and
qualities of leadership should be meticulously ensured.
6.4.(cid:9) Air-ground communications with ATC may
be governed as follows :-
162

(cid:9)(cid:9)
(a) In general, the emphasis should be on
(cid:9)
direCt pilot-controller(cid:9) communications
irrespective of crew composition.
(b) In the terminal control areas, the requirement
should be of direct pilot - controller
communication invariably so as to avoid time
lag in compliance of ATC instructions.
(c) In the enroute phase, a crew other than pilots
may handle radio communications with ATC subject
to basic flying instruments being in his view.
6.5.(cid:9) AAI should expedite commissioning of
ATC automated systems.
6.6 AAI should bifurcate ATS Route G-452 (which
is a high density traffic route) into
unidirectional arrival/departure corridors within
the limits of Delhi TMA to coincide with the
commissioning of ATS automated systems. Other bi-
directional routes may also be restructured
wherever warranted.
6.7(cid:9) Use of DFDRs/FDRs not according to the
163

parameters accuracy limits (or having tolerance
beyond those recommended) in ICAO Annex-6 Part-I
attachment/table D-1 should not be permitted on
public transport aircraft by the contracting States.
This can be ensured by the regulatory agency of the
country of manufacture at the time of issue of type
certificate in respect of a DFDR/FDR and by ICAO
taking steps to emphasise the need of implementation
of its recommendation by the contracting States.
6.8.(cid:9)
Public Transport Aircraft should be
equipped with' : -
(i) Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS)
(ii) Altitude Alert System
(iii) Altitude Acquisition System.
6.9.(cid:9)
Government of India should create a
suitable ATC element at a senior level in the DGCA to
properly oversee all aspects of ATC.
6.10(cid:9)
AirportsAuthorityofIndiashouldhavea
Member (ATC) on its Board to look after ATC matters.
Regional/Field ATC units should be placed under
unified command of ATC cadre.
164

(cid:9)(cid:9)
Govt. of India should integrate civil and
6.11.(cid:9)
military ATCs preferably on the pattern of NATS in
the UK.
Govt. of India should recognise due
6.12.(cid:9)
importance of ATC profession and accord special
status to it preferably by examining the feasibility
of de-linking ATS from the normal organisational set-
up and creating an independent cadre to be governed
by separate provisions.
(cid:9) AAI should introduce(cid:9) sectorisation
6.13.
Controlling in approach control and re-organise
working space in the Delhi airport ATC (new complex)
so as to match functional requirements of
Area/approach Control, ATC Simulator and IAF element .
The adequacy of planned number of work stations in
the new ATC should also be reviewed in the light of
anticipated increase in air, traffic.
Govt. of India should introduce the
6.14.(cid:9)
Scheme of licencing for controllers and make it
applicable to military, too, so as to achieve uniform
standards in controlling.
165

(cid:9) Govt. of India should establish an
6.15.
adequately staffed Accident/ Incident Prevention
Directorate in the DGCA so as to enhance the level of
safety In civil aviation in India.
