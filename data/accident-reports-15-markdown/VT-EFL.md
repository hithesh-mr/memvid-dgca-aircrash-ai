MINISTRY OF CIVIL AVIATION & TOURISM
DECISION OF GOVERNMENT OF INDIA ON REPORT OF THE COURT OF INQUIRY
OF THE ACCIDENT TO INDIAN AIRLINES B-737 AIRCRAFT VT-EFL
NEAR IMPHAL ON 16.8.1991.
On 16th August, 1991 an Indian Airlines Boeing-737 aircraft VT-EFL
crashed near Imphal while operating a flight IC-257 from Calcutta to Imphal.
The flight was under the command of Capt. Shekhar Haldar with Capt. D.B.
Roy Choudhury as Co-pilot. There were 69 persons on board including 6 crew
members. All occupants died in the crash.
2. Government of India appointed Shri Justice Umesh C. Banerjee of the
Calcutta High Court to hold a formal investigation into the accident under Rule
75 of the Aircraft Rules, 1937. Shri B.P. Baliga, Formerly Director of Engineer-
ing, Air India and Wg. Cdr. P. Ashoka, Executive Director (Flight Operations &
Safety), Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, Bangalore were appointed as asses-
sors to the Court of Inquiry. The report of the Court of Inquiry was received by
the Government on 30.4.1992.
3. The Court of Inquiry has concluded the 'Probable Cause of the Accident'
as follows :
"The accident occurred by reason of a grave error on the part of the
Pilot-in-Command in not adhering to the operational flight plan and
ILS let down chart and not realising that his early descent to 10,000
feet and turning right for outbound leg without reporting overhead
VOR would result in loss of time reference and as such misplace him
in the hilly terrain. The Pilot-in-Command's action may have been
influenced by his extreme familiarity with the terrain".
The Court has ruled out sabotage and structural failure as the cause of
the accident. The Court has made 40 findings and 50 recommendations.
4. The Government have accepted the report of the Court of Inquiry along
with the findings and the probable cause of the accident. Comments on each
finding are given at Annexure 'A'.
5. The recommendations made by the Court of Inquiry aim at enhancing
the safety of aircraft operations and are generally accepted for implementation
as indicated in Annexure 'B' attached.

INTRODUCTION
It has happened again - on Friday the 16th August, 1991,
the nation was stunned over the broadcast on All India Radio and
Doordm-
shan in regard to a major air accident wherein there were
no survivors. This time again it is a scheduled flight of a sched-
uled operator - Indian Airlines and the flight being IC-257 front
Calcutta to Imphal.

the seven people unfortunately while on a pilgrimage died. In
August, 1988, the Dauphin helicopter belonging M/s Pawan Hans
crashed near Pondicherry. Two several accidents thereafter in
October, 1988 within a matter of few hours stunned the nation
and the operators were Vayudoot and Indian Airlines. The occur-
rences being at Guwahati and Ahmedabad respectively. Again in
September, 1989, a Dornier aircraft belonging to Vayudoot also
crashed near Pune leaving no survivors. Within a period of three
months there was the Pawan Hans helicopter crash in December,
1989, near Patna. That is not the end of the accidents in our Civil
Aviation sector. In February, 1990, one of the most serious air
accidents of a most modern aircraft (A-320) did take place at.
Bangalore in which 92 persons died though providentially, howev-
er, 54 persons could escape the fatality. The next In the Hue is in
August, 1991, at Imphal killing all 69 persons on board including
the crew.
Considering the above data, there were thus, in fact, eight
accidents in three years between July, 1988, to August, 1991, in
which 363 valuable lives were lost.

The time has, therefore, now come to consider seriously as to
the happenings in the Civil Aviation sector in the country and a
proper introspection ought to be effected without losing any further
time - introspection to detail out our manlier and method of work-
ing so far as the civil aviation industry is concerned in tie country.
Courts of Inquiry have been constituted in the past - inquiry re-
ports have also come. I am sure the Government must have also
implemented quite a good number of the recommendations of
those Courts of Inquiries, but practicability of the situation,
however, demands more and not to be content with the recom-
mendations or implementations thereof.. It is at this stage that this
introspection is required - there must be something wrong some-
where as otherwise consistently from August, 1988 to August,
1991, so many fatal accidents would not have been there. We
should not be content with what we have done but we will have to
consider as to what is to be done in the matter of prevention of
future accidents of this nature. Human lives are precious and
invaluable. Monetary compensation or a word of sympathy will not
do - we will have to rise up to the occasion to stop the recurrence
of the same, which is otherwise avoidable in nature. The sense of
discipline ought to be inculcated in such a way so as to restore the
feeling of confidence in our national airline which at present is in a
gradual decline and I suppose no blame can be attributed to the
travelling community of the society, moreso by reason of the
happenings in the aviation industry of the.country in the recent
past as narrated above. Incidentally, it is not out of place to
mention that apart from the incidents noted above, which turned
out to be fatal, there are very many minor ones (not so fatal, but
could have been so) as appears front the media.
I am not trying to impute any failure on anyone but there is
Ito denial of fact that a feeling of insecurity is gradually gaining
ground in the minds of the people as regards the safety of air travel
in this country. I am conscious of the fact that the number of
accidents in our country may not be that much as is in some other
countries but that in my view cannot be a solace - that ought not
2

to give a sense of complacency in us so that we can take things as
they arc and leave it for the future to do the needful. TI cc lime and
the hour has come for us to rise tip to the occasion mid do our
utmost to save such fatalities.
The effort of the Government in the matter of prevention of
such fatalities, however, cannot but be appreciated. No sooner the
accident occurred at Imphal, the Minister of Civil Aviation and
Tourism announced over the media that this accident shall be
investigated by a Judge of the High Court and in pursuance
whereof I was appointed to head the Court of Inquiry under Rule
75 of the Aircraft Rules 1937 with two assessors - Shri B.P. Balia
and Wg. Cdr. P. Asltolca, one belongin g
(cid:9)g to
the engineering disci-
pline and the other a very renouned test pil
ot of the countr
terms of the notification, the time to complete the inquiry y. In
and to
make the report was stated to be 31st December, 1991, but subse-
quently by two several notifications dated 20th December, 1991
and 31st March, 1992, the time to make the report was extended
upto 30th April, 1992. A copy of the original notification
26th September, 1991 is however, annexed to this re
porttfeodr
convenience sake and is marked with letter 'A'.
(cid:9)
Furthermore, the subsequent request of the Government to
the Court to visit Australia and Singapore so as to have a compara
tive analysis of our civil aviation system goes to show in my view,
the sincerity of the Government in the matter of safely of the air
passengers.
It is to be noted that at the request of the Government, I did
visit Sydney so as to undertake a study of the Civil Aviation Indus-
try in Australia and on my way back home I did also visit, though
for a short while, Singapore to appraise myself of the systems
followed by the two most renouned airlines of the world toda,
y
namely, the Qantas Airways and Singapore Airlines.
(cid:9)

Briefly stated it has been a well-worth visit to Australia and
Singapore: I-low an airline operator engages itself in its Operational
sphere having due regard to the safety aspect is seen to be be-
lieved. The culture, the system control, the outlook, the sincerity
for the purpose together with the devotion to the concept of air
passengers safety needs special mention.
As regards Qantas Airlines, the thing which is of utmost
importance is the outlook of Qantas culture. Actions shall have to
be taken against any impropriety or deviation from Qantas culture,
but that should not be punitive in nature - it is not what has
happened but how to prevent the recurrence of the same - this
particular outlook has brought Qantas the name and fame as they
are enjoying today throughout the globe. -Another redeemin
g
feature of Qantas culture is the reliance on to the pilots' union: the
management in the event of a departure of the Hying norms though
takes note of the situation, but it is the union which, in fact, takes
care of the situation. Confidence on to the union to this extent,
cannot but demand praise and appreciation. In the event, howev-
er, there is recurrence of such a deviation from the flying norms
more than one occasion, it is the Qantas culture again that would
prompt the management to consider the matter in its retrospect -
analyse the situation including the training aspect and if it is so
felt necessary then and in that event the trainer himself gets a
further training to impart training to the flying crew - an unique
effort for safety ofair passengers.
Does the Operator in our country goes to this extent that a
small deviation needs that much of care and attention - do we have
the time, energy and the inclination - the answer probably be not
in the affirmative. - Noteworthy here that It is the operator and not
the regulatory authority witch takes this much of pain to study
the entire situation and see that the deviations, however, small in
nature do not recur again - public safety is predominant In gm
-tit-
tas culture. We do also have in our national airlines a Directorate
of Air Safety, but unfortunately the Mr Safety Directorate does not
4

even hold a meeting for a period of three years. Can it be said to
be a situation which is conducive to public safety - m
y answer
unfortunately cannot but be In the negative.
(cid:9)
I cannot but help noting another aspect even at this juncture
concerning the executive pilots. As in our system, the executive
pilots in Qantas Airlines do also fly, As a matter of fact the entire
operational management is being administered by the flyers only -
but there exists a difference and the difference being - whereas the
executive pilots in our country undertake flying just like line pilots,
if not slightly more, Qantas however does not allow ils
executive
pilots to fly more than one-third of what a line pilot does:
the
reason is not, however, far to seek - the entire administrative
super structure consists of the executive pilots and if they fl
y as
the line pilots do, where is the time to devote on to the organisa-
tional aspect and other administrative works - where is the lime to
think and evolve the best safety methods.
Incidentally, against a pointed question asked by me to Cat.
p
Mehta to the same effect, the answer of Capt. Mehta
wa s that
sufficient time is available to look into the adm
(cid:9)
inistrative
d
organisational aspect also - there lies probably the differen ane
ce : we
take things as they are : we have no intention nor any inclination
to give it a thought about the whole situation. We want to contin-
ue with the existing system as they are : attitude of the Australian
Civil Aviation Industry is, however, slightly different - It is a safety-
oriented approach and they evolved the system in such a way so
that the entire system can develop in its proper perspective having
due regard to the safety aspect. I will be failing in my duty if I do
not mention, however, here itself, that all the executive pilots are
duly compensated in terms of money and they get a fixed remu-
neration having due regard to the flying time with which the execu-
tive pilots otherwise would have been associated. The entire super
structure, therefore, of our national operator needs a change and it
is for the Government and the operator to look into the
Mattel' as
otherwise there will only be a compromise with the safety of air
passengers.
4A

The operator's organisational structure needs to be revamped so
that a culture is introduced which by itself would negate any
chance or risk and will promote safety. The details of the study
undertaken by me at Australia and Singapore will appear in this
report, suffice it to note, however, that the regulatory authority
ought to exist only for the purpose of supervision of the whole
system and it is the operator which needs to concentrate and
evolve the system of safety by which air travel in this country will
be as safe as in Australia or in Singapore. I am not prepared to
accept that we lack efficiency in any way, but what we lack is the
system control and the management and the operator should now
give it a thought in order to bring home the concept of safety in the
minds of air passengers which is in a gradual decline of present.

2. ME UNFORTUNATE FLIGHT
Indian Airlines night 1C-257 from Calcutta to Imphal and
then on to Dimapur was a scheduled flight of the operator. The
aircraft used was a Boeing 737 having registration number VT-EFI,
under the command of Capt. Sekliar Haldar and Capt. D.13. Ry
o
Choudhury was the Co-pilot. In accordance with usual practice
,
Hight briefing was effected at the flight despatch of the operator
and records to that effect were duly produced before the Court of
Inquiry.
There was also pre-flight medical checking of hot It t lie
pilot and the co-pilot and the usual Boeing 737 flight plan was
made over to the flight crew members which reads as follows:-

As per the flight plan, the aircraft had 7,900 kgs of aviation
fuel though the requirement was of 7785 kgs which takes note of
APU fuel, alternate fuel, holding fuel, manoeuvre and taxi fuel.
From the actual trim sheet, it appears there was also in fact 7,900
kgs. of fuel on board the aircraft and as such it can safely be
concluded that the aircraft had sufficient fuel to operate the sector
Calcutta to Imphal as <i scheduled night No.IC-257.
5

The flight crew detailed to operate the flight consisted of
Capt. Sekhar flaldar as the Commander, Capt. 1).13. Roy Choud-
hury as the Co-pilot with four cabin crew members Mrs. Suriya
Seat; Mrs. Sipra Majumdar; Miss Minoti Ray and Miss Sonali Roy.
There were altogether 63 passengers inclusive of one child on
board of which 31 passengers with the child were booked for
Imphal and 31 for Dimapur.
The scheduled departure time of the flight from Calcutta was
1130 a.m. (IST) on 16th August, 1991 and the aircraft, iii tact,
taxied out at 11.50 a.m. and it was airborne at 11.54 a.m. from
runway 191, at Calcutta airport. The ATC tape-transcript depicts
that initially the aircraft was cleared to flight level 70 (7,000 feet)
on track and from flight level 70 to flight level 150 (15,000 feet)
under Radar and further from Dhaka Control. The materials on
record show that the aircraft was cleared to Imphal via route B-593
and W-54 with flight level 290 (29,000 feet) having total flying time
60 minutes for this particular sector (Calcutta-Imphal). The air-
craft in accordance with the usual flight plan did call at Comilla
and reported "approaching overhead Alpha-Alpha Tango". The
Cockpit Voice Recorder also depicts that the aircraft did contact
abeam Silchar and thereafter came in contact with Imphal at
12:34:45 hours (1ST). At this stage, the aircraft conununicated the
revised ETA to Imphal and asked for descent clearance, which was
granted. At 12:36:57 hours (1ST) the ATCO at Imphal cleared the
flight IC-257 to descend to 10,000 feet and asked to report over-
head VOR for ILS Runway 04. At 12:39:45 hours (1ST) the aircraft
(IC-257) intimated the Tower that the aircraft is now 12 miles
inbound at 10,000 feet and the Tower at Imphal asked the Pilot
(IC-257) to maintain and report overhead VOR. Immediately
thereafter, however, within two seconds the pilot asked the ATCO
as to whether they can set course directly outbound for let down
and the ATCO at Imphal did permit the smile. AT 12:41:29 hrs.
(IST) the aircraft transmitted that they are approaching overhead
and three seconds thereafter the Tower transmitted a message
6

which reads; "understand you are proceeding on a radial 217. for
ILS" and four seconds thereafter the aircraft replied as affirmative?
The Tower however immediately asked to give a call commencing
the procedure turn.
At 12:42:13 hrs. (1ST), the aircraft was asked by Iniplial ATC
to proceed outbound for ILS approach for runway 04 descending to
5,000 feet. In the mean time, Imphal ATC allowed IC-890 to enter
runway 04 for take off to Guwahati. Proper separation was given
between IC-890 (departing aircraft) and IC-257 the arriving air-
craft. This aircraft was also informed about the traffic.
At 12:44:50 his. (1ST), the air craft (1C-257) reported com-
mencing procedure turn. however, after departure of IC-890,
Imphal ATC tried to contact [C-257 but there was no response.
After waiting for sonic time and giving several calls, Imphal ATC
started emergency procedure followed by search and rescue action.
At about 1700 hrs. (1ST) Implial ATC came to know through
police wireless that the aircraft (IC-257) was found to have crashed
on a hill (Thangjiiig) at a distance of approximately 20.5 NM on the
approach path of runway 04 of Imphal Aerodrome. The estimated
coordinates of the crash point are Lat. 24° 29' 54"N Long. 93° 40'
20"E. The aircraft crashed at 12:46:23 his. (1ST) under inclement
weather condition having low cloud, occasional rain.
After the impact with the hill the aircraft was completely
destroyed. All the 69 persons on board lost their lives. There was
post crash fire and as appears from the materials on record the
wreckage of the ill-fated plane with nose and front section disinte-
grated into pieces and were found South-West of Imphal aero-
drome at a distance of approximately 20.5 nautical miles and
about 300 feet below the highest point at that location in the form
roughly of an inverted 'L'. The long arm of inverted 'L' stretched to
approximately 300 to 400 metres and short arm stretched 50 to 75
metres as per visual estimate. There were burnt patches and the

area looked brown. The direction and spread of the wreckage
indicated a head-on-crash and a graze on the slope of the hill. The
vegetation and trees were either burnt due to sprinkling of aircraft
fuel and hot debris inunediately after the crash or were cut in the
direction of the hill at the time of the crash and was found limited
to the crash site. The factum of existence of unburnt material
including currency notes points to a definite direction that the fire
was after the crash. The damage to the aircraft was total by
reason of disintegration due to the impact with the hill.
Relevant extracts of the tape transmission as appears from
the Cockpit Voice Recorder of the ill-fated aircraft ought to be
noted at this Juncture and as such the same are reproduced below.
The details of the entire transmission, however, would appear from
a schedule annexed to this report and marked with Letters 'AA'.

3. POST-MORTEM EXAMINATION OF CRASH VICTIMS
1C-257 having taken olf from Calcutta on 16th August, 1991,
crashed near Imphal around 12:46 his (1ST) killing all 69 persons
on board the flight consisting of 63 passengers inclusive of one
infant passenger and 6 members of the crew. From the report of
Wg. Cdr. Dr. J.K. Gupta, Assistant Director General Medical Serv-
ices in the Office of the Director General of Civil Aviation, it ap-
pears that four bodies were brought down, identified and post
mortem work was conducted on the night of 17th August, 1991.
The next three days i.e. 18, 19 and 20th August, 1991, were spent
in conducting the post mortems of the victims as and when they
were brought down from the crash site. The post ittortei► ts were
conducted at the Regional Medical College, Mortuary 'withal by a
team of doctors of the Department of Forensic Medicines of the
college lead by Dr. L. Female, Associate Prof. of Forensic Medicine.
All the bodies were duly identified and forensic examinations were
had before the post mortem examinations of the bodies. The
evidence on record of Dr. Femate unmistakably suggests that there
was no chance, considering the injuries on the bodies, of life,
inunediately after the crash. Dr. Femate also stated that apparent-
ly whereas one or two bodies bore no sign of external injury, but by
reason of the intensity of the internal injuries, question of there
being any chance of life was not there and the death was instanta-
neous. According to Dr. Femate the burn injury may be simulta-
neous though burn injury alone is unlikely to cause death. The
traumatic injuries apart irom the burns were immediately fatal in
nature. On the issue of the cause of injury, Dr. Female's definite
evidence is that almost all the injuries have been caused by the
impact against the front seats and the back metal of the seats
would be capable enough to cause the same.
While it is true that no carbon monoxide deposit tests were
carried out at the imphal Mortuary, the samples of the lungs of the
victims particularly of the pilot and cabin crew were made over to
the appropriate authority for being tested at the Institute of Avia-
17

tion Medicine at Bangalore and Wg. Cdr. Gupta's report to this
Court expressly point out that samples of tissues from the bodies
of the pilot and co-pilot as well as one cabin crew member were
collected and sent to IAM Bangalore for examination. Wg. Cdr.
Gupta on the basis of the Toxology Report from IAM noted that,
there is no evidence of ante-mortem injury burns or carbon monox-
ide toxicity. For convenience sake the remarks column of the
report of IAM autopsy is quoted herein below:-
"All tissues show autolytic changes. The changes in
the lungs arc consistent with traumatic etiology. No
evidence of ante-mortem injury/burns or carbon
monoxide toxicity."
A copy of the report of Wg. Cdr. J.K. Gupta, however, is also
annexed hereto and marked with Letter '13'.
The observations of Wg. Cdr. Gupta who attended the post-
mortem examination along with two doctors of the operator (Indian
Airlines), namely, Dr. Das and Dr. Bhattacharya ought for conven-
ience sake be noted at this juncture in regard to the injury pattern
on the victims and the same are as follows :
Practically all the victims had a crash injury of
the head and face, hyperflexive injuries of the sternum
and dorsal vertebrae.
it) ifiLtssive decelerative injuries of the heart lungs,
diaphragm and abdominal viscera.
ill)(cid:9) Some distinguishable lap belt injuries of the
mesentry and the gut as well as pubic symphysis.
iv) The lower limbs had bilateral both bone frac-
tures mostly in the lower 1 /3.
v) Most victims also had fractures of one or both
ann bones.
vi) There was no evidence on gross examination of
carbon monoxide inhalation.
18

vii) There were no distinguishable ante-mortem
burns. Some sprinkle burns (possibly post mortem)
were noticed on the skin of some of the bodies. The
charring of the few bodies (4-5) appeared to be post
mortem as a result of limited post crash fire.
viii) There was no evidence of any penetrative or
missile like injuries.
ix) An interesting feature was the claw hands con-
figuration of both pilots with multiple fractures of
small bones of both hands.
x) More than GO% of the bodies which were re-
ceived more than 48 his. of the crash showed signs of
putrefaction and were defaced."
As regards the medical records of the night crew the saute is
dealt with under the heading "Crew Information" and as such need
not be dealt with at this juncture.

4. AIRCRAFT INFORMATION :
1)(cid:9) General:
The Boeing 737 Jet Transport is designed to operate over
short-to-medium ranges. Wing high-lift devices permit operations
from airports not formerly accessible to Jet transports. The 737-
200 is 100 feet long and has a 93 feet wing span. The maximum
operating air speed is approximately 350 knots EAS or 0.84 Macli.
maximum certified altitude is 35,000 feet.
11)(cid:9) Engine :
The airplane is powered by two Pratt• and Whitney JT8I)
turbo fan engines mounted under the wings. The engine is a
forward-fan-type engine with a twin-spool axial compressor. The
engine has nine can-annular burners in the combustion chamber,
and is provided with a multi-stage reaction-impulse turbine. The
multi-stage axial compressor consists of a low pressure unit, which
includes the fan stages, and a high pressure unit. The low pres-
sure unit is connected by a through-shaft to the turbine wheels for
the low pressure compressor, and the high pressure unit is con-
nected independently by a hollow shaft to the turbine wheel for the
high pressure compressor. The engine is equipped with a full
length annular fan-discharge duct. A hydromechanical fuel con-
trol governs the rotor speed of the high pressure com
► mpressor, and
schedules fuel flow to provide the thrust called for by the thrust
lever setting in the cockpit.
The wing mounted engines assures "eye-level maintenance."
The cowl panels hinge at the top of the engines or detach so that
most components are accessible without a stand. Engine accesso-
ries, plumbing, wiring, ducting, and fire wall attach points for the
two engines arc identical.

The engine inlets are forward of dirt, dust, and °Wier toieigu
material airborne in the wake of the main landing gent- and flaps.
The inlet environment of the wing mounted engines provides clean
bleed air for the airconditioning system. The engines are located
far enough outboard to clear water or slush spray pattern from the
nose gear. Reverse thrust is accomplished by two hydraulically
activated deflector doors which block engine exhaust gas slow and
deflect the exhaust stream forward.
Engine accessories arc easily reached from the ground by
opening hinge mounted engine cowlings. The oil tank, fuel/oil
heat exchanger, and supplementary lute! heaters are integral
engine parts. Each engine has a 40 KVA generator with a constant
speed drive. Pneumatic engine starters are operated by air sup-
plied through the pneumatic manifold from either the auxiliary
power unit, the other engine, or a pneumatic ground cart.
iii)(cid:9) Electrical:
Primary 115 Volt, 400 Hz. AC electrical power is supplied
from a 40 KVA geneiator located on each engine. The D.C. electri-
cal system is composed of three 50 ampere transformer-rectifier
(TR) units, a 22 ampere hour battery, and a battery charger. The
APU drives a single 40 KVA generator that may be used for main
generator back up power in Hight, and can provide power to all
airplane buses. on the ground.
Pilot electrical load management has been reduced to a
minimum. In the event of an engine or generator failure, loads
which are necessary to maintain all primary flight functions are
automatically transferred from the dead bus to the remaining
generator system. This continuous primary power capability
allows the pilot to continue existing flight operations until he can
review the electrical panel and take remedial action. Transferred
primary loads will not cause an overload sufficient to trip the
21

remaining generator. The APU may then be started to assume the
total load of the dead bus.
The DC power distribution system also has automatic trans-
fer to preclude any interruption of power to the primary radio,
flight instruments or flight controls. Ground operation electrical
requirements can be supplied either by the APU or from a ground
power supply. hi either case, all busses can be powered.
iv)(cid:9) Structures:
The structure of the aircraft is designed to provide maximum
strength with minimum weight. The materials most commonly
used are aluminitun, steel and magnesium alloys. Aluminium and
fibre glass honey comb material is used extensively. The fuselage
is a semimonocoque structure with the skin reinforced by frames
and stringers. The fuselage consists of four sections of which the
forward three contain the cockpit, passenger and cargo accommo-
dation whereas the fourth section provides the support to the
empennage. The doors are removable units which enclose various
compartments of the aeroplane and which permit entry to or exit
from those compartments by passengers, crew or maintenance
personnel. The doors are divided for their specific purpose into
several groups viz. passenger/crew doors; emergency exits; cargo
doors; service doors; fixed interior doors. An electrical door warn-
ing system is provided to indicate to 'the Ilight crew that all doors
are closed and properly latched before the flight. The structure of
wing consists of the left wing box, centre wing box and the right.
wing box. Throughout the wing, the skin panels are reinforced by
span-wise stringers and spars. The control surfaces along the
trailing edge of each wing consist of inboard and outboard flaps, an
aileron and a total of four spoilers. The fuel tanks are located in
the wings and are inter-connected. The empennage comprises a
dorsal fin, a vertical fin, an adjustable horizontal stabilizer, rudder
and elevators. The structure of the aeroplane is protected from
corrosion by application of various linishes.
2 2

v)(cid:9) Pneumatics
Pressurised air is bled from the engine compressor sections
for cabin airconditioning (heating, cooling, ventilation), cabin
pressurisation, engine starting, and thermal anti-icing. The
sources of bleed air are the eighth stage compressor and the thir-
teenth stage compressor. Bleed air from these sources is either
used separately or combined as necessary to ensure adequate air
under high demand conditions. Air front the eighth stage com-
pressor is used primarily for airconditioning, wing anti-icing, and
other systems connected into the airconditioning manifold. Air
1:10111 the thirteenth stage compressor Supplements eighth stage air
for airconditioning and supplies hot air for anti-icing the fuel
heater and nose cowl. High pressure air for hydraulic reservoir
pressurisation also comes from the 13th stage bleed.
Normally, bleed air is used from both engines, however,
bleed air from either engine is sufficient for operation of the
pneumatics systems. Airflow is also available from the compressor
section of the Al'U for engine starting and airconditioning on the
ground. The pneumatic system can also be supplied directly from
a ground air cart using pressurised air from the cart for engine
starting and for aireonditioning.
vi)(cid:9) 'hydraulics
The hydraulic system is divided into three functionally
Independent 3,000 psi systems designated 'A', 'B', and 'standby'. A
fire resistant fluid is used for maximum protection against fire.
System 'A' is powered by two engine driven pumps. It provides
hydraulic power for flight controls, ground spoilors, inboard flight
spoilors, landing gear extension and retraction, trailing and leading
edge flaps, slats, nose gear steering, brakes and thrust reversers.
System 'B' is powered by two electric motor driven pumps and
provides hydraulic power for the flight controls, brakes, outboard
23

I
flight spoilors. In the cargo configuration, system '13' also provides
hydraulic power for the cargo door. The standby system, powered
by a separate electric motor driven pump, provides backup power
to the rudder control system and is also used for alternate exten-
sion of the leading edge flaps and slats. Alternate operation of the
thrust reverser is provided by the standby system or by accumula-
tor pressure.
A hydraulic system control panel installed on the pilot's
overhead panel includes hydraulic pump switches, low pressure
warning, electric motor pump overheat warning, and a ground
inter-connect control switch. Flight controls hydraulic system
switching and warning are on the overhead panel within easy
reach of either pilot. The fluid quantity and pressure information
indicators are located on the First Officer's instrument panel.
vii) Landing Gear and Brakes
The landing gear is a conventional tricycle dual-wheel
system. Gear retraction and extension is accomplished with
hydraulic components. The main gear retracts inboard, while the
nose gear retracts forward. The wheels retract to from an effective
wheel-well closure, sealed by a blade type seal. Intlight brake
cooling is accomplished by wheel-well ventilation through vents in
the outboard wheel hubcaps.
A manual extension system allows the gear to free fall down
and locked by double spring bungecs when the uplocks arc re-
leased. A visual means for determining inillght that the landing
gear is down and locked is provided by the gear viewers on the
passenger airplanes. In the cargo configuration, only the nose gear
viewer is available. A redundant electrical system is provided for a
secondary indication that the main gears are in the down and
locked position 1)y lights located On the all overhead panel.

Nose wheel steering is provided for directional control during
taxiing using hydraulic power to turn front zero to 78° to either
side.
The brake system consists of main wheel multi-disc brakes
powered by the two independent hydraulic systems. A dual
hydraulic brake system is provided, with the inboard wheel brakes
powered separately from the outboard wheel brakes. Maximum
braking efficiency is provided with a modulating anti-skid system
which senses individual wheel activity during the landin a nd
g(cid:9) -
automatically controls brake pressure to each wheel. When
stalled, an automatic brake system provides automatic braiklle-
application on touch down. Braking gradually increases 10 a level
selected by the pilot.
viii) Navi ational Instruments
Flight instrumentation includes a flight director system that
provides roll and pitch axis conunand in
(cid:9)
This system is
suitable to permit manual control of the airplane during lower
weather minimum conditions. An appro
located adjacent to the ilight director indicatach progress displaY
or supplies computer
operating mode data. Independent compass and altitude systems
are installed with in-line monitoring of the directional and vertical
gyros. The low range radio altimeter system (when installed) facili-
tates low approach capability. Additional navigation Instrumenta-
tion includes: ADP' radios, VOR/localizer (with glide-slope
function), marker beacon, DME, ATC transponder (when installed),
and weather radar. Conventional air data instruments (Mach,
airspeed, vertical speed, and altimeter) read directly from the
separate pilot-static sources for the Captain an
d First Officer.
Electric air data instruments receive information

ix) Conununication Instruments
The conununicalions equipment aboard the airplane is inte-
grated into various systems utilised to convey audible information
between ground fact sties, the airplane's crew, and passengers.
The VHF radios provi e airport and airways communications. The
flight interphone pe nuts communication between flight crew
members and betwe ii the slight and ground crew. The service
interphone allows cm ununication between flight crew and mainte-
nance personnel. Tl e passenger address system provides voice
communication to ti e passengers or music reproduction (when
installed). Selcal is p -ovided for company-to-crew communications
(when his ailed).
(cid:9)
x) Auto Flight
The auto-pilot rovides stabilization in pitch and roll during
normal climb, cruise and approach conditions. Functions of the
auto-pilot include 11 ading and altitude control, VOR/ILS beam
coupler, glide-slope coupler, and turbulence penetration. The
basic mode of the auto-pilot operation permits the pilot to intro-
duce pitch and loll c nunands to the auto-pilot through movement
of the control column and control wheel. This feature is known as
control wheel steerin and is utilised hi place of the turn and pitch
controller.
xi)(cid:9) Flight Controls
The swept-bac high speed wing is equipped with control
surfaces and high lift devices that offer excellent flight character's-
tics and short-field p rformance. All 737 flight controls are fully
hydraulic powered w th simple manual reversion, except for the
rudder, which operat s a third hydraulic power source and sepa-
rate actuator to back l') the(cid:9) hydraulic dual-tandem actua-
tor power system.
26

Lateral control is provided by one aileron and two pro-
grammed flight spoiler panels on each wing. The iiIglil
spoiler
panels arc also efficient speed brakes that may be extended at airy
airspeed without affecting lateral control. In addition to the flight
spollors, additional ground spoiler panels are located on the wing
inboard and outboard of the engine nacelles to provide additional
"Lift dumping" and deceleration after touch down. Manual rever-
sion control forces are minimized by aileron balance tabs and
single hinged balance panels.
Longitudinal control is provided by the elevators which are
powered directly by two independent hydraulic power packages. In
Me event of complele hydraulic power loss, manual reversion will
permit manual control directly to the elevators. The horizontal
stabilizer trim control system provides longitudinal trim of the
airplane by varying the incidence through 17 units of travel of the
horizontal stabilizer. Directional control is provided through a
single conventional rudder, hydraulically powered through a
simple and reliable low friction cable system. In addition, a hy-
draulic powered standby system provides the necessary backup
and eliminates rudder tabs, balance panels, mid lockout mocha-
ilisms while maintaining safety and control reliability.
xii)(cid:9) Ice and Rain Pi otectIon
An electrical anti-icing system protecis the windshield and
pilot heads. -Thermal anti-icing guards the leading edge slats and
engine cowls.
The rain removal system consists of windshield wipers and
rain repellent dispensers. Each wiper is electrically operated by a
separate system to ensure that clear vision is maintained during
take off, approach and landing. The rain repellent system is used
in conjunction with the windshield wipers to improve visibility
during heavy rain. Each window is controlled independently by
separate switches.
27

xiii) Airconditioning and Pressurisation
The airconditioning system provides conditioned pressurised
air to the cockpit, passenger cabin, lower nose compartment, both
cargo compartments and the airconditioning distribution bay. Air
supply to the airconditioning system is furnished in flight by the
pneumatic system from either engine bleed air or the auxiliary
power unit (APU). During ground operation, air is supplied from
engine bleed air, the auxiliary power unit, a ground pneumatic
supply cart, or a ground conditioned air supply cart. Part of the
warm air supply from the engines or pneumatic cart is passed
through. the airconditioning packs to be cooled. The cold air is
then mixed with the remainder of the warm air as required to
obtain the temperature air called for by tlie•temperattire control
system. This conditioned air then passes into the cockpit and
passenger cabins through the distribution system.
The outflow valves are regulated to exhaust only that addi-
tional quantity of air required to maintain the desired pressure in
the cabin.
The pressurisation control system provides three independ-
ent modes of operation - automatic, standby and manual. The
system is electrically operated, and electrically controlled, and
meters the exhaust of ventilating air to provide controlled pressuri-
sation of the cockpit and passenger cabin, the electronic compart-
ment, both cargo compartments, and the lower nose compartment.
The system is completely automatic and under normal conditions
requires no adjustment by the flight crew throughout the night.
xiv) Fire Protection
Airplane fire protection is achieved by use of a fire detection
system and an overheat detection system, supported by the lire
extinguishing systems. The engine and APU fire detection systems
arc electrical heat sensing systems that respond to a general
(cid:9)
11
28

overhead condition or a localized fire condition by activating
warning lights and an alarm bell Or an outside horn in the ease of
the APU.
The extinguishing system has two separate freon applica-
tions for either engine. Associated amber discharge lights on the
fire warning control panel will illuminate when either the left or
right bottle has been discharged or the safety relief valve has
melted and bottle pressure is bled off. A separate fire extinguish-
ing bottle is located in the APU compartment for APU fire protec-
tion. An amber light on the fire control panel illuminates when
bottle pressure has fallen to approximately 250 psi. In addition,
two indicator disks, a red and a yellow, are installed in the airplane
skin on lower right side of the empennage to indicate thermal relief
or system discharge.
Emergency equipment includes fire extinguishers, first aid
kits, oxygen, megaphones, and lights for use in the event of an
inflight or landing emergency. Escape slides, escape ropes, and a
crash axe are installed to assist in abandoning the airplane, and to
aid in rescue operation.
xv) Oxygen
Separate high pressure systems supply oxygen to the crew
and passengers. Crew oxygen is a diluter-demand type. Passenger
oxygen is a continuous flow system with supplemental walkaround
bottles.
xvi) APU
The auxiliary power unit (APU) is installed in the aft end of
the airplane fuselage, behind the pressure bulkhead, and under
the horizontal stabilizer. A generator, identical to the engine
generators can furnish electrical power during ground operation or
can be used as a main generator backup power hullight. The APti
29

also provides pneumatic power for starting, airconditloning and
pressurisation. A safe, accessible installation is provided, with the
APU shock mounted in a sound-proofed compartment equipped
with a fire detection, warning, and extinguishing system.
xvii) Warning Systems
The aural and visual warnings alert the flight crew to condi-
tions that require action or caution in the operation of the airplane.
The character of the signals used varies, depending upon the
degree of urgency or hazards involved. A central switch is located
on the main panel, which tests all lights and can place the lights in
a bright or dim condition. In the dim position, the approach
progress display has an automatic intensity control feature which
will raise or lower the indicator light intensity proportionally to
ambient light conditions.
Aural, visual and tactile signals are used singally or in
combinations to provide simultaneously both warning and infor-
mation regarding the nature of the condition. Red warning lights
located in the area of the pilots' primary forward field of vision arc
used to indicate engine, wheel-well, APU, or cargo fire, auto-pilot
disconnect (flashing), and landing gear unsafe conditions. Blue
lights when bright indicate associated valves in transit or valves in
disagreement with appropriate control switch.
Audible warning for airspeed limits is given by a clacker,
cabin altitude by an intermittent horn, and a steady horn in flight
warns that the landing gear is not down. An intermittent horn on
the ground warns that the airplane is not in a take off configura-
tion.
Stall warning is provided by a control column shaker on the
captain's control column. Conditions which require caution of the
flight crew are indicated by means of amber caution lights.

xviii) Flight Recorders :
Flight Data Recorder:
This aircraft is fitted with 5 parameters engraved foil record-
er Flight Data Recorded (FDR) manufactured by Lockheed Aircraft
Services as Model 109D. FDR is installed above the ceiling panel
at station 947, left of the airplane centerline. But the accelerome-
ter is installed on the forward side of the left main wheel well
forward bulkhead. FDR recorder spool is capable of recording
permanently following 5 parameters for a duration of minimum
200 hours :-
1. Airplane altitude;
2. Air Speed;
3. Magnetic heading;
4. Vertical acceleration; and
5. Elapsed time.
The power supply required for FDR is 28V DC, 1 15V AC and
26V AC.
The Flight Recorder may be turned ON and OFF manually by
the toggle switch on the flight recorder test module. If it has not
been turned manually, it will be turned on automatically by the oil
pressure switch when one engine is started and turned OFF when
the engine is stopped. The parallel circuit through the ground
sensing squat to the relay turns the recorder ON when the airplane
lift the ground.
Flight Recorder test module and the monitor panel are locat-
ed on P-5 panel. The monitor circuit monitors application of power
and tape movement. It also furnishes 400 Hz signal (beep) to the
monitor unit when the flight recorder is operating. On the FDR
unit indication is available of the number of recording hours
remaining on the tape installed in the unit. Also under-water
Locator Beacon is installed on the MR Unit.

413. UTILISATION OF NAVIGATION AND COMMUNICATION AIDS :
Navigational information is derived from the following sys-
tems :-
(a) ADF System - There are two ADF systems on this aircraft.
ADF-1 and 2 are identical except for the pointer. No.1 ADF
is connected to single bar pointer and ;No.2 system is con-
nected to double bar pointer in RMI on Pilot and Co-pilot's
side. Control boxes arc located on the pedestal. The ADF
when tuned to a particular station gives bearing of that
station which is read on the RMI.
(b) VOR System - There are two VOR systems on this aircraft.
Two VOR Nay. Receivers of No.1 and 2 systems are located in
the Electric and Electronic (E&E) compartment. The VOR
indications are available on RMI one on each side. These
RMI are common for ADF also with the transfer possible with
selector. The VOR information is also available on the
Course Deviation Indicator (CDI) one on each side. The VOR
station frequency is selected in the control box & audio can
be monitored either from pilot or copilot station.
(c) instrument Landing System (I LS) of 13737 aircraft -
VHF/NAV. receiver No.1 used for VOR No.1, is same for
Localizer No. 1. Similarly Nay. Receiver No. 2 is common to
Localizer No.2. The Localizer frequency is selected in the
control boxes of No.1 and 2.
Glide Slope signal is also processed in the same VHF Nay.
Receiver unit. Thus Nay. Receivers (Systems No.1 & 2)
process signals for VOR, Localizer, and Glide Slope. If Local-
izer frequency is selected in No. 1 control box and when
signal strength is sufficient enough, the Hag of pliot's side
CDI will disappear and the vertical bar will deflect 'OFF'
centre depending upon the position with respect to the
35

centre fine of the runway, vertical bar will be at the centre.
In FDI (Flight Director Indicator) Runway Symbol also moves
laterally against an index mark according to position of
aircraft with reference to the centre line of the runway.
When the ILS frequency is selected either on No.1 or No.2
control boxes, the Glide Slope receivers will be automatically
'ON' (paired frequency) and with the capture of glide path
beam the flag on FDI and CDI (on both pilot and copilot side)
will disappear. The horizontal pointer (both on pilot and
copilot side) will deflect off the centre. Pilot follows the bar
and pointer to align the aircraft to the centre line of the
runway and glide path. If either the ground equipment or
the aircraft equipment is faulty the flag will appear on the
CDI (Course Director Indicator) and FDI (Flight Director
Indicator).
The Marker Beacon Receiver (one only) is installed in the
E&E compartment. There are two sets of Marker light indi-
cators consisting of three lights on each side installed on
pilot and copilot's instrument panel. 'Blue' light is for Outer
Marker, 'Amber' for Middle Marker; when the aircraft passes
over the Markers, lights will illuminate on both pilot and
copilot's side. Simultaneously audio signals will be heard in
loud speaker/Head set.
(d) Weather Radar A weather radar system consisting of an
antenna, transreceiver, control module, and Plan Position
Indicator (PPI) is installed on the airplane. The received
signals are converted to a visual picture on the PPI. The PPI
presentation, of ground and weather returns enables the
pilot to navigate utilizing ground returns, or to detect weath-
er and make a decision to penetrate or circumnavigate the
storm cells.

(e)(cid:9) Low Range Radio Altimeter (LRRA) :- Two low range radio
altimeters provide signals to the autopilot. flight director
computers and NUM light. Two indicators, one on cacti pi-
lot's panel, read absolute altitude.
Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) The DME receiver
provides the necessary signals to the DME computer, which
converts the signals to read range to the station.
(g)(cid:9) Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) : Ground Proxim-
ity Warning System (GPWS) provides the pilot with aural and
visual warning of potential dangers of flight path related to
the ground. GPWS processes radio alt it.talc information from
No.1 low range radio altimeter (LRRA), altitude rate informa-
tion from Central Air Data Computer (CADC), Glide Slope
deviation information is derived from VOR/ILS system and
landing gear and landing flap position signal to provide
warning of the following -
1. Excessive rate of descent.
2. Excessive terrain closure rate.
3. Altitude loss alter take oil.
4. Unsafe terrain clearance.
5. Excessive deviation below glide slope.
Note :- The GPWS will not provide a warning if an airplane is
flying directly towards a vertical cliff. •
GPWS consists of ground proximity computer, two warning
lights labelled 'PULL UP', a warning speaker, two glide slope
warning indicators with inhibit facilities labelled 'BELOW
G/S'.
The red warning light labelled 'PULL UP' is installed on each
pilots instrument panel which conies 'ON' to provide visual
indication. GPWS generates warning of the unsafe light
path.
37

Rectangular shape amber Glide Slope advisory light labelled
'BELOW G/S'. is installed on each pilots instrument. panel.
0/S warning light when pressed inhibits the G/S deviation
working. The warning speaker provides an aural warning of
the unsafe flight path.

4C. MAINTENANCE RECORDS :
Scrutiny of the maintenance records of the aircraft reveal the
following :-
(a) No Mandatory Modifications/Inspections were outstanding
at the time of the accident.
(b) Life limited components of the aircraft and engines were
within the prescribed/approved limit.
(c) Repetitive defects of last. 3 months pertaining to Communica-
tion, Aircraft Controls, Radio Navigation Systems and En-
gines were scrutinised. It was observed that -
(1)(cid:9) Flaps not extending to 40 position/getting stuck up
between 3Q-40 units repeated between 22.5.91 to
4.6.91 (13 days). This was filially rectified on 4.6.91
by replacement of screw Jack assemblies 1 & 8 which
were found worn.
(ii)(cid:9) On Radio Navigation System "Weather Radar unreli-
able" repeated between 5.8.91 and 9.8.91. It was _final-
ly rectified by replacement of radar Tx.Rx.
WO No. 1 engine N2 fluctuation snag repeated between
21.7.91 to 29.7.91. This was finally rectified by re-
placement of N2 Tacho Generator. It may be men-
tioned that on 24.7.91 also N2 Tacho Generator was
replaced.
(cid:9)
(iv) Oil temperature fluctuation snag on No.2 engine
repeated between 4.7.91 and 14.7.91. II was tinallv
rectified by replacement of oil temperature bulb.

(d)(cid:9) Further, while scrutinising the defects of last six months on
engine of this aircraft following were observed :-
(cid:9)
(I) On 6.4.91 EGT gauge fluctuation between 300 to
450°C. This was rectified by cleaning the EGT gauge
plug.
(11)(cid:9) No.2 engine all parameters shooting up while starting
on 10.4.91. This was rectified by replacement of Fuel
Control Unit (FCU).
(iii) R.H. engine cowl valve light 'conies ON and OFF' on
23.4.91. Engine cowl valve was replaced.
(iv) No.1 EPR gauge sluggish during change of power on
21.6.91. No.1 EPR transmitter was replaced.
(v) On 14.7.91 No.2 engine start up was slow. No.2
engine Ni indicator replaced and No.2 bleed valve
clamp tightened.
(vi) On 7.8.91 No light up during No. 1 engine starting,
Igniter box replaced.
(e)(cid:9) Engine Trend Monitoring :
The Engine Trend Monitoring System for P&WJT8D-17A
engines comprises monitoring of following parameters-
EGT, Ni, N2 and Fuel Flow.
With regard to .EGT, the shift was +5°C for both engines
against the limit of 20°C. Also for Ni the shift was 0% against the
limit of 1.7%. Regarding N2, it was 0% for No.1 engine and 0.4%
for No.2 engine against the limit of 1.3% and for fuel flow the
deviation was 0% for No.1 engine and 2% for No.2 engine against
the limit of 5%.
40

The above trend monitoring covers the period from 3.8.1991
to 12.8.1991 for No.1 engine and 23.5.1991 to 12.8.1991 for No.2
engine.
In view of above, the trend monitoring data reveal that
engine performance during the above period showed no abnormali-
ty.
(1)(cid:9) Check-B Schedule :
Check-B was carried out on this aircraft on the night of
15/16.8.1991. During this inspection, Electrical AME carried
forward the APU generator defect as per MEL as suitable spares
were not available. The snag pertains to APU generator not coming
on line, recorded after the operation of Service No.IC-277 of
15.8.91.
Airframe AME who carried out Check-B Schedule attended
two minor defects - (i) forward attendant seat not secured; (ii) aft
toilet flushing cable was snapped.
For (i) temporary repair was carried out and the snag was
carried forward for necessary permanent repair. With regard to (ii)
toilet servicing was done al Calcutta. This snag was further car-
ried forward due to non-availability of spares.

5 FUR CVR READ-OUTS:
The report of the Inspector of Accidents as also the evidence
on record disclosed that the Lockheed Flight Data Recorder
(Sl.No.555) was retrieved though in a slightly damaged condition at
its rear portion and a missing front main seal from the crash site
but the engravings on the aluminium foil were otherwise readable
so as to appreciate the necessary flight path and other incidental
details in regard to the entire flight from Calcutta to Imphal. It is
true that the static connector on front face was found broken and
the pilot mating connector of the aircraft had sheared off from
tubing but the recorder could be opened as per the statement of
Slrri Satendra Singh, Director Air Safety at DGCA Ilcadquarters
without any difficulty.
The Flight Data Recorder of the 111-fated flight was decoded
and subsequently reviewed in my presence at the Technical Cen-
tre, DGCA Headquarters, New Delhi as also in the presence of the
assessors appointed by the Central Government. It was viewed on
the Nikon Profile Projector and all the engravings on the alumini-
um foil could be clearly seen. Incidentally it is to be noted that
this particular Lockheed Flight Data Recorder has basically only
five different parameters, namely, (i) Altitude; (ii) Heading: (iii) Air-
speed; (iv) Vertical Acceleration; (v) Time. This particular FDR
seems to be a very old type of FDR since all modern aircraft have
fitted with a Digital Flight Data Recorder having around 300 sever-
al parameters - obviously making the investigation of any air crash
easier, precise and exhaustive. The lack of other parameters
creates some sort of inconvenience and difficulties in the matter of
investigation though, however, it cannot be said to be of an impos-
sibility since the difficulties are not insurmountable in nature. It is
always better to avail of the latest scientific achievement rather
than depending upon an obsolete method in order to arrive at a
correct 1111(1111g.

Incidentally, however, it is to be noted that out of the live
parameters available on an MR of the like nature, this particular
FDR however recorded only four during the entire course of Hight
and the vertical acceleration parameter was available only for short
interval during the take oft phase from Calcutta. Therefore, this
particular parameter, namely, the vertical acceleration for all prac-
tical purposes is not available to this Court of Inquiry for the
Inquiry. The non-availability of this part imtlar parameter may be
due to two reasons (i) The recording stylus of the unit got adrift as
a result it was well neigh impossible to have the engravings on the
aluminium ibil and (ii) Loss of vertical acceleration data signal due
to mat-functioning of some systems. It is to be noted, however, in
the event of the happening as at (ii) above, It will however, leave a
straight line engraving on the aluminium foil -which was, however,
not seen on the foil. In the absence of which one can safely con-
clude that there was no real-functioning of any system of the FDR
unit but the stylus recording the vertical acceleration got adrift
inunediately after the take off from Calcutta Airport. This deficien-
cy of the stylus getting adrift cannot, however, by any stretch be
said to be a mal-functioning of a unit neither it can be ascribed to
be a defective FDR unit at the time of commencement of journey
from Calcutta.
This Court of inquiry thus is slightly handicapped by reason
of non-availability of the vertical acceleration of the aircraft.
The decoding of the FDR foil was taken using a lens of 50 X
magnification and the values of the parameters obtained were
checked for their validity and found to be accurate. The details of
the parameters would appear from a schedule Annexed hereto and
marked with letter "C".
Cockpit Voice Recorder:
On the available evidence it appears that this particular
aircraft VT-EFL was titled with a (Fairchild Cockpit Voice Recorder
43

Serial No.65 1 9) and was recovered from the crash site though after
some efforts. The evidence further disclosed that the dust cover
had to be cut for the purpose of opening out this recorder and all
the electronic cards in the rear portion were found severely dam-
aged due to the impact. The stainless steel crash proof casing was
taken out by cutting the inner casing of the CVR. The stainless
steel box could be opened, however, without any difficulty and the
megnetic tape was iound intact. Alter slight adjustment,t he tape
could be played and it was noticed that all the recordings were
available. The transcription was prepared at the Technical Centre,
DUCA Ileadquartcrs, New Delhi by Sim V.K. Chandna, Capt. S.S.
Panesar and Shri L.N. Lal all belonging to the DGCA Headquarters,
New Delhi, and holding responsible positions. The tape transcript
was heard by me along with the assessors and copy thereof was
made over to all the parties. To be definite about the correctness
of the transcription, I directed that the tape be replayed in the
presence of all the parties, but since some confusion arose during
the course of hearing, there was a further re-checking at the DGCA
Headquarters at New Delhi in the presence of the ICPA officials as
it was stated that the colleagues of the pilots operating the ill-fated
alight could be in a better position to identify the voices and the
exact transmission. It is to be recorded, however, that slight
modification of the transcript was affected after having the tape
played for a number of occasions. It will not also be out of place to
mention that during one of the Court hearings Shri K.I3. Roy
Choudinify being the father of Capt. D.I3. Roy Choudhury, (lie Co-
pilot of the ill-fated aircraft was also requested to identify the voice
of his son - whereas one of the transmissions could be identified,
but sonic difficulties was experienced by him in regard to the iden-
tification of other transmissions and hence the second exercise as
above had to be undergone in order to obviate ally doubt in the
matter of correctness of the transcription. Extracts of the CVR
recordings have already been noted above.

5.1 FDR AND CVR CO-RELATION:
At this stage, however, it would be convenient to note the co-
relation between the FDR readings and the CVR transcript for the
purpose of ascertainment of the correctness of the call-outs front
the aircraft. This in the normal course of events may not be of any
consequence since the FDR reading should match with the corre-
sponding tape transcript but in this particular unfortunate inci-
dent it appears that there are certain major discrepancies between
the call-outs and the MR data.

From the above co-relation, it appears that IC-257 after
reporting approaching overhead Charlie Mike Lima and level 290
changed the heading from 076° to 053° instead of 007° as per the
flight plan provided by the operator, in this case, the Indian Air-
lines. Subsequent transmission at 06:51:44 from the aircraft to
Agartala Tower to the elect 'Roger India 257 approaching overhead
Alpha Alpha Tango' cannot be said to be a correct transmission by
reason of the heading, namely, 053 as noted above. On the head-
ing of 053 the aircraft could not possibly have gone overhead Alpha
Alpha Tango. This, therefore, seems to be a wrong call-out and
according to Capt. Mehta, the then Operations Manager of Indian
Airlines at Calcutta, the aircraft was nowhere near Agartala over-
head and it was a wrong reporting. Capt. Mehta also agreed that
this wrong reporting cannot but be ascribed to be lack of discipline
so far as the pilot was concerned (Capt. Mehta Q. 238 - 241). In
this context the evidence of Capt. Rahut is of some significance: At
first there was an attempt on the part of Capt. Rahut to avoid
answering the question directly as to the factum of the aircraft
being overhead Alpha Alpha Tango by saying that it would be
otherwise impossible to be overhead Alpha Alpha Tango since the
obtuse angle cannot be availed of by the aircraft and hence there is
a likelihood of violating the Bangladesh air-space. (Capt. Rahut
Q.19) Subsequently, however, on a pointed question that lie being
an experienced flyer, does he also avoid the flight plan with a
heading of 007 and cut short overhead Agartala by taking 053
direct route to Imphal and the answer of Capt. Rahut in no tweet
--
47

.taro terms suggest that lie being an experienced flyer would invar-
iably report overhead Alpha Alpha Tango and there should be no
problem in regard thereto (vide Q. 239). Shortly thereafter, howev-
er, Capt. Rahut has also stated that even though the other pilot
may not be as experienced as him, he should be able to negotiate
the turn from a heading of 007 without any difficulty (vide Q. 248 -
249). Incidentally, it is to be noted that the flight plan itself pro-
vides that after reporting VGCM i.e. Comilla with a heading of 073'
the aircraft is supposed to proceed at a heading of 007 and should
report overhead VEAT i.e. Alpha Alpha Tango (Agartala). This flight
chart has been prepared by the operator itself.
and there is ample
evidence on record that the chart should be adhered to in its
observance rather than in its deviations. Flight charts are pre-
pared having due consideration of all the relevant and necessary
particulars with one object in mind namely the safety of the air-
craft and when the flight chart specifically provides for reporting
overhead VEAT that should imply that this route prescribed is
otherwise safe and in accordance with law without any violation of
any foreign air-space. As such Capt. Rahut's evidence in regard to
violation of Bangladesh air-space cannot in my view be accepted
and properly appreciated. Obviously Capt. Rahut's evidence In
regard thereto namely the violation of Bangladesh air-space was
under misconception of the entire situation to say the least about
it. On the subject, still, the evidence of Capt. M.V.V. Rao also
ought to be noted - unfortunately, with Capt. Rao also there was
an attempt to avoid the issue in regard to the adherence of the
flight chart as prepared by the operator - Capt. Rao has stated that
as a matter of fact in the normal circumstances though there
ought not to be any deviation from the chart but deviations can be
had in regard to the altitude. I have not been able to follow this
particular evidence of Capt. Rao. Flight charts as noted above are
to be observed. Question of deviation therefrom does not and
cannot arise. This laxity ought not to be allowed otherwise the
sanctity of the flight chart. Is completely obliterated. I should have
thought that the head of the training institute of the operator
should be more fair and frank in regard to the failure if any on (lie
48

part of the pilot to follow the flight chart. But unfortunately, there
was au attempt to avoid answering the question in a fashion as is
expected of a trainer. There cannot be any manner of doubt that
under certain exceptional circumstances one may deviate from the
flight chart with the permission of the ATCO, but that can only be
termed to be an exception rather than a regular feature which in
this case as detailed more fully below has happened. I was sur-
prised that, the evidence of Capt. Rao when he stated before this
Court that as a matter of fact on a plain reading of the CVIZ he was
extremely happy as to how a pilot has conducted himself during
the course of flight even though he had the FDR reading with hint
which negates such an appreciation. The training master ought
not to be quite content with what lie has done apparently but he
must go deep into the matter - compare the actual with the CVIZ
transcript and see for himself whether in fact lie has followed the
procedure or not. There ought not to be a sense of complacency in
a trainer that my pupil has done everything correctly. On the
contrary, the first attempt should be to make out as to whether
there is any failure on his part so that the lives of the passengers
are not in any way put into any jeopardy. Human lives are pre-
cious. It ought not to be lost by the whim or caprice of a particular
individual and this ought to be the subjective training to be im-
parted on to the trainee. Iii this context, reference can be had to
9.
No.344 - 347. On a pointed question, however, Capt. Rao had
to eventually admit that if he was doing the route check and if the
pilot-in-command was following the same pattern lie will not pass
the pilot-in-cortunand to get his command licence (vide Q. No.349).
It is pertinent to point out, however, that Capt. Melita the
erstwhile Operations Manager of Indian Airlines has been extreme-
ly fair and this Court records its appreciation on this score.
Coining back once again on to the co-relation of the FI)IZ
chart and CVIZ transcript, it appears that al (17:14:0I the aircraft
categorically made a transmission to the effect "We are now 6500",
but in fact, from the FDR it is apparent that the aircraft was at a
49

height of 7600 feet and not at 6500 feet. This transmission also
goes to show an incorrect call-out being given by the aircraft.
Capt. Mehta in no uncertain terms admitted that the call-out is
wrong since there is difference of about 1,000 feet. Similar is the
transmission at 07:14:42 wherein the altitude call-out has been to
the effect 5000; 5900 and on a question from ATCO as to confirma-
tion of 5000 the call-out from the aircraft was "affirmative". But in
fact, the aircraft was about 6880 feet - why this wrong call-out,
can it be that the Altimeter at the front panel have gone wrong.
this possibility according to me prior to the evidence could not be
ruled out, but Capt. Mehla in no uncertain terms stated that it is a
wrong call-out and the possibility of the Altimeter going wrong does
not and cannot arise. Capt. Mehta stated with conviction that
there are two Altimeters and two systems are independent and
both the systems cannot go wrong simultaneously (vide Q. 421). I
accept the evidence of Capt. Mehta on this score that no snag can
be said to have occurred so as to render both the Altimeters un-
serviceable during the course of flight. This factual of acceptance
of Capt. Mehta's evidence is based on subsequent scrutiny of the
FDR reading and the call-out when both the recordings did in fact
match with each other : To wit,
i)
At 06:48:28 aircraft transmitted Flight Level 290 and corre-
sponding FDIZ data shows 28933 feet.
ii)
At 06:52:15 the aircraft reported maintaining level 290 FDR
recorded 28933 feet. Same is the position at 06:54:22
ill)(cid:9)
At 06:58:34 aircraft transmitted descending front level 290 and
FDR shows steady descent from 28933 feet.
iv)(cid:9)
At 07:05:00 aircraft transmitted approaching 135, FL)It. shows
at 07:05:08 14610 feet and continues to descend.
At 07:09:45 aircraft communicated altitude at 10,000 and
FDIZ also records 10,000.
50

vi)(cid:9)
Finally, the aircraft crashed at 5209 feet as per FDR, which in
fact, has been the correct altitude at the crash point.
It, therefore, appears that there was no snag so far as the
Altimeters are concerned, rather the discrepancies can be stated to
be by reason of wrong call-outs. The other observations in regard
to the flight path and the adherence to the let down chart and the
timing therefor as appears from the co-relation of the FDR and
CVR recordings will appear under the heading "Flight Path followed
by the ill-fated Aircraft" as more fully detailed hereinafter in this
report. For convenience sake, however, the flight data plot as
appears from the FDR and the corresponding transmissions co-
related on the plot would appear from a schedule annexed hereto
and marked with letter 'D'.

a)(cid:9) Capt.Sekhar Haider, Commander :
Capt. Sekhar Haldar was born on 10 November 1953. He
was issued with ALTP Licence No. 1415 on 11.3.1988. He was
appointed by Indian Airlines on 22 May 1985 and was deputed to
C.T.E., Hyderabad for initial training and subsequent training on
13oeing 737 aircraft.
His total flying experience was 3783 lu-s. out of which flying
experience on Boeing 737 aircraft was 2369 lu-s. and 1414 lu-s in
other types of aircraft including F-27 aircraft.
After having flown on Boeing 737 as Co-Pilot, he was given
pilot-in-command endorsement on 27.11.1989 and was having
flying experience as PIC on Boeing 737 for 1115 lu-s. The details of
his recent flying experience are given below -
Experience in last 6 months 254:55 his.
Experience in last 30 days 62:35 lu-s.
Experience in last 7 days 18:35 hrs.
Experience in last 24 lu-s. 1:50 hrs.

upto 9.11.1991. Date of last Route Check was 14.5.1991 and valid
upto 13.11.1991. FRTO Licence No. 2742 was valid upto
21.1.1992.
Capt. Sekhar Haldar was based at Calcutta.
(b)(cid:9) Capt. D.B.Roy Choudhury, Co-Pilot
Capt. D.B.Roy Choudhury was born on 30 September 1964,
He was issued with CPL licence No. 1592 valid upto 1.9.1991 by
DGCA. He was appointed by Indian Airlines on 24 February 1989
52

and was deputed to C.T.E.,Hyderabad for training. After endorse-
ment. On Boeing 737 he was cleared as Co-pilot (P2) on the type. He
has got following flying experience :-
Total flying experience 1647 hrs.
Total experience on B737 as P2 1397 Ins.
Total experience in last 6 months 298:20 lirs.
Total experience in last 30 days 51:25 lirs.
Total experience in last 7 days 11:30 hrs.
Total experience in last 24 hrs. 1:50 Ins.
His last Route Check was done on 5.5.1991 and valid upto
4.11.1991. Last Instrument Rating Check was done on 21.11.1990
and valid upto 20.11.1991. Last licence renewal was 8.6.1991 and
valid upto 20.11.1991. FRTO Licence No. 3077 valid upto
1.9.1991. He was required to wear corrective glasses.
Capt. D.B. Roy Choudhury was based at Calcutta.
It is to be noted that both Capt. Haldar and Capt. Roy
Choudhury have had the required pre-flight medical examination
for alcohol and was cleared without any remarks by the concerned
Doctor with a certification "N.A.D" i.e. 'No Abnormality Detected'.
It is to be noted, however, that there is no clinical examination as
such but the check is in regard to pre-flight alcohol test. The
proforina for such a certification also contains a column to that
effect. The remark 'No abnormality detected' (NAD) in my view
cannot be termed to be a sufficient certification more so when in
fact there exists a breath analyser equipment at the Calcutta
airport. Question of there being an abnormality in a pilot when he
is to report for duty does not and cannot arise. The test is not for
the purpose of detection of any abnormality but for an alcohol
check so as to assure that the pilot has the necessary mental equi-
librium during the flight. The certification, therefore, ought to be
in consonance with the object for which such a test is asked to be
had before the flight.
53

It is also noted at this juncture, however, that. Wg.Cdr.
Gupta, Asstt. Director Medical Services(Air) of DGCA has examined
the report of the samples of tissues collected from the bodies of the
pilot and co-pilot along with the cabin crew and also scrutinised
above medical reports of both the pilots and upon such scrutiny
came to a definite finding that both the pilots have been medically
fit through their flying career and there is nothing to indicate
presence of alcohol at the time of the accident.

7. METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION
The ill-fated aircraft 1C-257 took off from Calcutta Airport at
0624 UTC(1154 IST). In accordance with the usual practice the
pre-flight briefing did take place at Flight Despatch of the operator
at Calcutta Airport including weather condition at Iniphal prevail-
ing at 0430 UTC (1000 IST). The briefed weather as per the Flight
Briefing is to the following effect :-
VEIM 0430; 230/06 Kis; Vis 2000M RA; 4/8 800; 4/8 1800;
6/8 9000 ft; 1/8 CB 25000 ft.; '1' 21; DP 20; 1008; Ts overhead.
Pre-flight briefing also records weather at 0500 UTC as also
0530 UTC to the following effect :-
VEIM 0500: 270/03 kts: 6 Km: RA: 3/8 1500 ft: 4/8 1800:
6/8 10000: T 27; DP 22; 1009 HP.
VEIM 0530: wind calm: 8 kin: 3/8 1000 ft: 4/8 1800: 6/8
10000: T 23: DP 22: 1009 HP.
Incidentally it is to be noted that the alternate aerodrome of
the flight being Guwahati (VEGT) and the weather for VEGT was
also included in the pre-flight briefing.
The aircraft also obtained the Calcutta meteorological condi-
tions at the time of take off and the Tower cleared the aircraft for
take off with surface wind calm.
The ill-fated aircraft came in contact with Imphal ATC at
0653.42 UTC and shortly thereafter Imphal weather was given to
the following effect :- wind 270/03 kts; vis. 7 kin; cloud 3/8 800;
5/8 1800; 8/8 10000; T 26; DP 24; QNI-I 29.80;
Incidentally it is to be noted that the weather passed was of
0630 UTC. Detailed weather report of 16th August 1991 at differ-
55

mt. points of time would appear frOm a Schedule annexed hereto
and marked with letter 'E'.
It is to be noted in the context of the crash taking place at
0716 UTC, the Tower ought to have transmitted even in the normal
circumstances the weather conditions at Imphal shortly after 0700
UTC, more so when the Meteorological Office as a matter of fact
has made available the 0700 weather conditions to the Tower
being inclement having 1/8 CB to the following effect:-
"290/04 kts; vis 7 Kin; 3/8 800 (240M); 5/8 1800 It.; 1/8 CB
30001t(900M); 8/8 10000 ft.(3000M) T 26; DP 23 QNI I 1009 HPA;
29.80 INS QFF, 919 HPA 27.14 INS; CB NE".
This weather, however, was above the operator's weather
minima for an ILS approach at Imphal.
It is pertinent to note here, however, that 0430 UTC meteoro-
logical report as was available with the Flight Despatch of the
operator, categorically recorded that the CB was existing over
Imphal airport. Subsequent meteorological report at 0700 UTC
however, records the movement of CB in the north-easterly direc-
tion and as such it can safely be concluded that the existence of
CB would not in any way affect the flight path of the aircraft, as per
the flight plan which is from the South-West direction. In the
premises the affectation of the flight path by reason of existence of
CB does not and cannot arise. In any event, however, the ATCO in
my view ought to have transmitted the weather conditions immedi-
ately on receipt of the same from the Meteorological office irrespec-
tive of the fact that the same would not affect the flight path of the
aircraft. It is the duty and an obligation on the part of the ATCO to
intimate all necessary informations to the pilots and non-conunu-
nication cannot but be termed to be a lapse on the part of the
ATCO though, however, it has no material bearing into the cause of
the crash.

The CVR transcript, however, at 07:16:04 UTC records a
transmission from the Tower to the aircraft that. the rain was ap-
proaching from the East and part of the airfield was under rain.
The factum of such communication has also been noted by the
aircraft.
During the course of hearing, strenuous submissions have
been made by the operator mainly as also the Indian Commercial
Pilots' Association in regard to the existence of very severe upper
wind. The upper wind data, however, as obtained from the Mete-
orological Office negates such a contention. The record shows for
the month of August, 1991 an upper wind in the region of 2 to 12
knots at 5,000 feet level and between 1 to 8 knots at 10,000 feet
level. The Meteorological Office in no uncertain terms stated that
this wind-measurement was effected by putting up balloons and
the measurements were taken with a theodolite equipment. As
regards the upper wind data for 16th August, 1991, it has been
stated to be at 03 knots at 5,000 feet level at about 12:30 hrs. So
far as 10,000 feet level is concerned, no data is available, but
considering the ground wind being at 4 knots at that time and 3
knots at 5,000 feet level it cannot vary to an enormous extent and
it is obviously in the region of less than 10 knots - though, howev-
er, it is a presumption only.
Considering the above, in my view, however, that the upper
wind cannot possibly render any significant change in the flight
path of the aircraft during the let down procedure. In this context
the evidence of Mr. James Kerrigan, being an Aeronautical Engi-
neer of the Boeing Company, Seattle Washington, ought to be
noted. Mr. Kerrigan has categorically stated that in spite of a
variable wind between 5 to 20 knots, there shall not be much of a
difference in the flight path of the aircraft. Mr. Kerrigan has had
simulator exercises on the basis of this variable wind and pro-
duced the graph before the Court which as a matter of fact corrob-
orates the statement as above. For convenience sake, the graph
produced by Mr. Kerrigan is annexed hereto and marked with
letter 'F'.

8. AERODROME INFORMATION :
The coordinates of the Iniphal aerodrome are 24° 45' 49"
North, 930 54' 11" East. It's general elevation is 2536 feet but the
elevation of runway 04 is 2532 feet above mean sea level. It has
one runway 04/22, and the runway 04 is, however, equipped with
Instrument Landing System (ILS). This runway 04 was intended
ibr landing and has ilie following declared distances :-
(a) Take off run available is 9010 feet.
(b) Take off distance available is 10378 feet.
(c) Landing distance available is 9010 feet.
(d) Accelerate stop distance available is 9210 feet.
(e) Runway 04 has cement concrete surface and Pavement
Classification Number (PCN) is 28.
Unfortunately, this particular airport does not have any
recording devices so far as the transmission from the ground as
also from the aircraft are concerned. On the factual score a very
sorry state of affairs appears to be existing even this day. One ATC
multi-channel tape recorder supplied by Stencil lloffman of USA
was received at the Imphal Airport in early 1983. For a period of
four years no step whatsoever has been taken to have the seven
channel ATC tape-recorder conunissioned. As a matter of fact as
appears from the letter dated 10th September, 1991 from National
Airports Authority to the Director General of Civil Aviation that the
recorder was installed in June 1987 but it could not, however, be
commissioned for want of certain vital components. I fail to appre-
ciate as to how a new equipment could not be commissioned for
want of certain vital components. The equipment supplied ought
to have been checked up by the appropriate authority at the initial
stages that some vital parts are missing. Question of importation
of fm-ther required spares for the purpose of conunissioning a new
equipment, in my view, does not arise. This is contrary to all
norms of a conunercial transaction and •the supplier ought to have
been intimated in regard thereto immediately after the supply. For
58

four long years nobody seems to have taken any notice of a costly
equipment. Admittedly it is a sophisticated electronic unit which
cannot possibly be performing well in the event not put to use for a
period of four years. Even after the detection that certain other
components are required, all concerned seem to be taking things
very easily on the plea that DGTD is not giving any required clear-
ance and subsequent queries to the Indian agent as also foreign
supplier did not evoke any response - I mu, however, not prepared
to accept such a Justification as has been given to the Director
General of Civil Aviation by the National Airports Authority in
terms of their letter noted above. When a Governmental agency
enters into a conunercial transaction with a foreign supplier, it
must act in a manner a commercial organisation is supposed to
act. The price has been paid and the equipment has been deliv-
ered, but no benefit has accrued to anyone - why this attitude - is
it because it is a Governmental property - if this be the case, then
it is high time that somebody should be told how commercial
transactions should be effected and the concerned department
should be properly oriented to meet such a situation. In fine I
have no other alternative but to record a totally sad state of affairs
in regard to [lie dealings of a GovernmeMal agency. The altitude
seems to be totally indifferent which an organisation connected
with Civil Aviation cannot afford to have: human lives are involved
and the Governmental agency is quite satisfied by simply writing a
letter that steps are being taken to improve the whole situation. I
record my total dissatisfaction on to the whole situation in so far
as this aspect of the matter under investigation is concerned.
The Aeronautical. Information Circular (A.I.C.) 14 of 1984
dated 18 September 1984 issued by the Director General of Civil
Aviation, R.K.Puram, New Delhi records that the aerodrome is
surrounded by a number of hills awl t he height and direction of
different hills have not yet been determined. Subsequently howev-
er, upon the formation of the National Airports Authority, this
particular airport has been provided with Instrument Landing
System (ILS). Though in 1984, the details of obstructions had not.
59

(cid:9)
been determined, obviously the National Airports Authority prior to
the introduction of the ILS let down procedure have been able to
detail out these hills and other obstructions in the area in ques-
tion. It is to be noted that after preparation of ILS let down chart,
the same was sent to the operator, being Indian Airlines, for their
comments and the operator duly accepted the same as being
otherwise safe. Needless to record here that the operator has been
operating on the Instrument Landing System since 1987 at Imphal
Airport and at no point of time any objection has been raised by
the operator. As a matter of fact, during the course of hearing no
submission even has been made by the operator in regard to any
deficiency in the Instrument Landing System as per the let. down
chart at the Imphal Airport. The ICPA (Indian Commercial Pilot's
Association) however before this Court of Inquiry raised a doubt as
regards to the primary and secondary areas which according to
ICPA can not be termed to be safe operational areas as stipulated
by ICAO. It is to be noted here, that Shri S.A.Ram, Deputy Director
of N.A.A. and incharge of the preparation of the Instrument Let
Down Chart, in question, stated that there, in fact, exists a pri-
mary and a secondary area and the distance from VOR to the outer
limit of the primary area would be about 19 nautical miles and the
limit of the secondary area would be an additional 2.5 nautical
miles. Shri Ram has stated that.secondary area would extend
upto 21.5 nautical miles Irom the VOR. While it is true that the
pilots are never given any primary or secondary area chart, but
while preparing the let down chart some safety zone shall have to
be provided to cater for the error on the part of the pilots so that
the same may provide a cushion or a buffer. It is pertinent to note
that primary area provides for a clearance of 984 feet above the
highest obstruction within the area and if one proceeds thereafter
towards the outer boundary of the secondary area, this clearance
of 984 feet is progressively reduced to zero at the outer extremity of
(cid:9)
VIP
the secondary area. -
From the ILS let down chart it appears that the aircraft after
reporting overhead VOR at 10,000 feet should descend to 8,000
60
INF

feet on the holding pattern itself and then proceed on to the out-
bound leg for 2 minutes 30 seconds from VOR upon a further
descent from 8,000 feet to 5,000 feet at the commencement of the
procedure turn with a speed not exceeding 170 nautical miles per
hour. The aircraft whilst on the procedure turn is supposed to
further reduce its height to 4,200 feet and upon capturing the
localiser to proceed inbound. Height of the aircraft shall have to be
at 4,020 feet at the outer marker inbound and then land with the
assistance of the other landing aids available at the airport. It is
significant to.note here that the Pilot-in-Command of the aircraft is
not aware of any primary or secondary area but a strong adher-
ence to the let down chart is expected from the pilot. It is in evi-
dence that deviation from the lel down chart is not permitted in
IFR flight. Safety of the aircraft on the basis of the let down chart
cannot be doubted in any manner whatsoever. Capt. Rahut in his
evidence categorically stated that the let down chart cannot be said
to be unsafe from any point of view. Though it is true that the
chart is not unsafe by any stretch but that does not, however,
mean and imply that the buffer or the cushion though intended at
the time of preparation of the let down chart shall not be existing
as a practical reality. The primary and the secondary area ought,
therefore, to be free of any obstruction or any material obstruction
considering the altitude, the aircraft is supposed to be in that area.
In the ILS let down chart it has been shown that there exists
an obstruction immediately before the outer marker inbound at a
level of 3094 feet above sea level and considering the elevation of
the Imphal airport the obstruction height is to the extent of about
600 feet. The ILS let down chart provides the outer marker in-
bound level at 4,020 feet and considering the ICAO regulation of
obstruction free distance being 984 feet the let down chart can not
be described to be unsafe in any manner. The importance of
obstruction free primary and secondary area however, can not be
decried in any way but since a doubt has been expressed in regard
to the same it would be better for all concerned to review the entire
situation specially pertaining to the North Eastern Region Airports
61

and also the hilly terrain airports in the country so as to provide
the necessary buffer to the aircraft in reality rather than in tem-
plates only. I wish to make it quite clear that the let down chart is
quite safe and this is also the considered view of my Assessors, one
being an experienced flier and other being a reputed engineer. The
view as above has also been corroborated by senior officials of the
operator as well.
It is to be noted that C.T.E. of Indian Airlines as early as in
1989 did inform N.A.A. that the let down procedure Is of lierwise
satisfactory for normal ILS. Though however, in the meantime
they have suggested slight variation of the altitude at the outer
marker inbound level from 4,020 to 4,200 feet by reason of activa-
tion of G.P.W.S. on account of hill near outer-marker. But no posi-
tive objection has been taken in regard thereto. The suggestion is
merely on the basis of GPWS system and not otherwise a safety
requirement.
Considering, however, the importance and urgency of the
situation, this Court directed the DGCA and the National Airports
Authority to review the whole situation even during the pendency
of this investigation.
For convenience sake the ILS let down chart is detailed
hereunder :-

The ILS let down chart as noted above categorically points
out that upon obtaining the glide slope at 4,020 feet, the pilot
should follow 035° heading and then land provided, however, the
runway is visible at 224 feet above the runway level. In the event.,
however, the runway is not visible at the height mentioned above,
the aircraft is supposed to do a missed approach procedure and
climb straight ahead to 4,200 feet and then turn left to join the
VOR. holding pattern at 8,000 feet. Similar provision has been
made in the chart in the event of the glide slope or the middle
marker being not available, the aircraft in that event., however,
cannot land unless the runway is visible from an height of 317 feet
and the aircraft is to carry a missed approach procedure as noted
above. The procedure laid down is elaborate and if followed clues-
tion of the let down chart being unsafe does not and cannot arise.
The distance between VOR and the outer marker is around 6
nautical miles. From outer marker to the farthest point on proce-
dure turn the distance would be around another 5 nautical miles
and calculating the total distance, therefore, it comes to around 11
nautical miles from VOR. Obstruction if any admittedly is at 17.3
nautical miles at an altitude of 4,265 feet. There is, therefore, a
cushioning area of 6 nautical miles for the aircraft to obtain ILS
assistance and land at Imphal Airport presently.
Mr. Rain has stated that at an indicated speed of 170 knots
and having taken into account statistical wind of 15 knots together
with an additional 10 knots the aircraft can fly otherwise very
safely for 166 seconds outbound from VOR. In accordance with
the chart, the aircraft is not supposed to fly more than 150 sec-
onds. Therefore, total cushioning flying area is to the:, extent of 16
seconds, whkh cannot. by any stretch be termed to be low for safe
distance. As a matter of fact, this cannot be said to be unsafe at
all. Thus, from whichever point of view the chart is looked upon,
namely, either from distance•-wise or frost► Hying time-wise thew is
sufficient cushioning even at this stage in so far as the let down
chart is concerned.
64

Turning back on to the evidence tendered before the Court, it
is seen that Capt. Rahut himself has submitted that 60 nautical
miles tail wind will drift the aircraft forward maximum to the
extent of 2.5 miles beyond the farthest point of procedure turn and
in the event of farthest point of procedure turn is treated as 11
nautical miles then in that event at best it can come upto 13.5 •
nautical miles and not beyond that. Assuming a further cushion-
ing zone of 2.5 nautical miles is added thereon, the distance there-
fore comes upto 16 nautical miles. It, therefore, appears that there
ought not to be any difficulty experienced by the pilot even if there
exists a tail wind speed of 60 nautical miles provided there is due
adherence to the let down procedure. It is, however, placed on
record that the tail wind of 60 nautical miles does not have any
corroborative documentary evidence since the Meteorological
report leas recorded maximum upper wind at 5,000 feet as 3 knots
on 16th August, 1991. It is however, placed on record that accord-
ing to the Director Aviation Services, Mr. L.K. Murthy "The esti-
mated 06Q0 UTC wind on 16.8.1991 at Imphal at 3.1 Kms. is
120/10 kts."
In that view of the matter the question of existence of ob-
struction in the primary area being the cause of the accident does
not arise. The answer to the inquiry namely can this aircraft by
reason of 60 nautical miles tail wind drift to the crash site cannot,
therefore, but be in the negative.

9. NAVIGATIONAL AIDS AT IMPIIAL AIRPORT :
The Inspector of Accidents reports that there exists following
Navigation and landing facilities at Imphal airport :
"(a) Instrument Landing System (1LS) comprising of Local-
izer, Glide Path, Middle Marker & Outer Marker.
(b) Very High Frequency Omni-Directional Radio Range
(VOR).
(c)(cid:9) Non-Directional Beacon (NDI3).
It may be mentioned that no Locator Beacon is in-
stalled either at Middle Marker or Outer Marker.
Also no DMF, is installed with the VOR at this aero-
drome. It is understood from National Airports Au-
thority (NAA) that DME equipment was received at
Imphal in July, 1991. Its installation is likely to be
taken up in early October (1991) and is assessed to be
completed towards the end of November 1991. Subse-
quently, however, the Inspector of Accident reported to
this court by way of a letter dated 5th December,
1991, that the DME has already been installed and
has become operational on and since 29th November,
1991.
Instrument Landing System:
The Instrument Landing.
System enables the pilot of an
aircraft to make a safe approach and landing on a
runway even under adverse weather and visibility
condition. The system provides azimuth guidance,
elevation guidance and distance from threshold infor-
mation.
Function of components of 1LS :
(a) Localizer :
The Localizer provides lateral guidance or azimuth
guidance and enables the pilot to align the aircraft
with the centre line of the runway. Localizer coverage
is provided up to a distance of 25 NM within 10
0 on
either side of extended centre line of the runway and a
distance of 17 NM within 350.
(b)(cid:9) Glide Path :
The Glide Path provides elevation guidance, due to
4 which aircraft is able to descend along pre-determined
66

path during landing. The normal glide angle is 2° to
4°. It provides coverage upto 10 NM within a sector of
8° in the direction of approach.
(c) Outer & Middle Marker :
The Outer and Middle Markers, located at specified
distance front the runway along with the approach
path, provide information to the pilot regarding posi-
tion of the aircraft with reference to runway threshold.
(d) Monitors :
These components of ILS are provided with their asso-
ciated monitoring remote control and status indication
system. Monitoring system keeps under check the
performance of the equipment and in case of malfunc-
tioning, switches over to standby equipment. In case,
standby equipment also does not perform within speci-
fied tolerance the facility is automatically shut down.
Remote control and status indicator system facilitates
in switching ON/OFF from a remote location as well as
to know the status of serviceability of the facilities.
As per ICAO requirement, routine flight checks on ILS
should be carried out once in 90+ 15 days.
(ii)(cid:9)
Imphal ILS Equipment & Installation :
ILS system at Implial comprises of Localizer, Glide
Path, Middle and Outer Markers. These facilities were
eonimissloned In February, 1987 and were last flight
tested on 5.6.1991 and operational status of all the
components of ILS was declared unrestricted.
(a)(cid:9) Localizer :
Localizer G.C.L. 721 was manufactured by Gujrat
Communication and Electronics Ltd. The Localizer
equipment consist of main and standby channels
installed in all equipment room at the airport. The
Localizer is installed at time end of runway 04 at
Imphal. These Transmitters function on electrical
energy supplied by battery on trickle charge. In case
of power supply failure, standby generators supply
power. If generator fails, the batteries continue to feed
transmitter tor approx. lour hours. The transmitters
are installed in air-conditioned room located in opera-
tional area at the airport. One transmitter works at a
thne and other is standby. The signals from equip-
ment is radiated by aerial assembly installed at the
stop end of runway 04.
The transmitted beam covers 35° on either side of
centre line of runway 04. Localizer range is 25 NM
67

within ± 10°
Iron' the beginning of the runway. Fur-
ther clearance signal is also generated which gives
pilots indication
of the vicinity of the aircraft from the
extended
centre line of the runway when aircraft
comes within 35°
. The range of this clearance signal is
about 75% of the course
signal. The vertical coverage
of the Localizer Beam signal is 7.5
0. The radiated
signal is constantly monitored and its accuracy is
automatically checked through monitors installed in
the equipment cabinet.
(b)(cid:9)
Glide Path :
The Glide Path equipment, type GCL 741, manufac-
tured by Gujrat Communication & Electronics Ltd.,
comprises of two transmitters installed in an air-condi-
tioned
equipment room. Like Localizer, one transmit-
ter is the main and other is standby. Power supply to
Glide Path Transmitters is similar to the already stated
'earlier in case of Localizer Transmit tors. One trans-
mitter works at a time. The Glide
Path facility provides
elevation information to the aircraft at
distance an assured
of 10 NM. The normal Glide Path angle at
Imphal is 3°
it . The radiation pattern is so adjusted that
gives a sector width from -0.30to + 1.750111 vertical
direction where Ois the prescribed descend angle.
This signal is available within + 8
°
with respect to
extended centre line in horizontal plane while the
aircraft descends to glide angle and maintain the
correct position on Localizer.
The radiated signal from Glide Path system is continu-
ously monitored by near field monitors. In case of out
of tolerance signal radiated main transmitter
automatically shut down and standby start will
ing. function-
In case of radiation of out of tolerance signal
by
standby transmitter, the monitors will shut down
standby transmitter also.
As per pre-
determined and published approach proce-
dure for ILS at Imphal, the aircraft is expected to
report over VOR (Airport at a height of 10,000 ft.) and
then in a holding pattern descend to 8000 ft. and then
go outbound parallel to the extended centre line of the
runway at a bearing of 217
°
170 Kts. (VOR) upto 2.5 nits. at
in a descending
phase (8000 ft. to 5000 ft.).
'filen the aircraft initiates the procedure turn, turning
left to 172° and then
right to 352°
. In this process, the
pilot descends from 5000 ft. to 4200 ft. above mean
sea level (AMSL). While turning inbound, he is expect-
ed to get We Localizer beam and I011ow the same until
lie is "on Localizer". The pilot. 'then captures glide path
and
starts descending and gels glide path signal. The
pilot will cross the Outer Marker at 4020 it AMSL.
68

The arrangement of monitors and remote control for
Glide Path is identical with the Localizer described
above.
(c) Outer Marker :
This facility is located at a distance of 4.5 NM from the
threshold of runway 04. This facility is used as check
point while aircraft makes ILS approach.
Audio-visual signals will be received by the aircraft.
while over the Outer Marker, the duration of which,
when exactly aligned to the centre line of the runway,
varies between 6 to 13 seconds. The height of the
aircraft overhead Outer Marker should be 4020 ft.
AMSL at 'withal.
(d) Middle Marker :
This facility identical to Outer Marker except it is
located at a distance of 0.7 NM from the threshold of
runway 04 and the expected height of the aircraft over
Middle Marker is 2815 ft. AMSL.
(e) Remote/Status Indication :
Remote indication/control is available in the equip-
ment room on the ground floor of the Control Tower
Building. The indications are in the form of red and
reen lights. It: shows the particular transmit ter of
g
ocalizer/Glide Palh (swilling at any moment. Similar
indications arc available for monitors.
As per ICAO Annex-10, aerodrome Control Tower and
Units providing approach control service should be
provided without delay with information on the opera-
tional status of Radio Navigation Aids -essential for
approach, landing and take off at the aerodrome(s)
with which they are concerned.
However, soon after the accident status indication
lights in the Control Tower at Imphal were found
unserviceable".
ILS at (cid:9)
Inspector of Accident further reports that on the day of
accident, all Navigational Aids at Imphal aerodrome were service-
able. As per recommendation by ICAO, ilight inspection of 11,S is
required at 90 clays ± 15 days interval. As per records, last period-
ic calibration check of ILS was carried out on 5.6.1991.
69

After the accident a special Hight check of ILS was carried
out on 18.8.1991 to ascertain its operational status. Except for
course line alignment of Localizer all other parameters of Localizer
and Glide Path were within limits.
In case of Markers except for higher duration of Markers
indication, all other parameters were also within limits.
FLIGHT UNDERTAKEN TO LOCATE CRASH SITE WITH RE-
SPECT TO IMPHAL VOR
The Inspector of accident reported that a Hight was carried
out on 19.8.1991 by Dornier aircraft of National Airports Authority,
normally used for calibration flight. During this Iliglit, the average
time worked out from the Outer Marker to crash site and back at
an altitude of 8000 ft. at a nominal IAS of 170 Kis. was 4 mis. 40
seconds. The crash site was found to be at a distance of 20.5 NM
from VOR on radial 220°.
While it is true that the Inspector of Accidents reported that
the distance between crash site and the VOR Imphal to be 20.5
NM, some doubt was expressed as to the correctness of the same-
by reason wherefor I had to undertake a special joureny to
Guwahati for the impose of ascertainment of correct distance, but
by reason of bad weather conditions prevailing at Imphal, no
success could be achived as more fully detailed under the chapter
on 'General Outline of Investigation by the Court of Inquiry'. It
would however be convienient to note at this juncture that a fur-
ther attempt was made by the Court to ascertain the same by
directing the Director General of Civil Aviation to obtain the neces-
sary coordinates of Thangjing Hill and the distance from the top of
the hill to the VOR Imphal to be certified by the Surveyor General
of India in pursuance whereof the Deputy Director Tech. for the
Director Survey (AIR) in the Directorate of Survey intimated the
70

Director General of Civil Aviation the coordinates of top of Thangj-
ing Hill to be as follows :-
THANGJING (1915 M)
Latitude 24° 3()' 12" N
Longitude 93° 40' 35" E
The VOR Imphal coordinates being
Latitude 24° 46' 01" N
Longitude 93° 54' 28" E
and on the basis of the above the distance- between the above
noted two points was certified to be 20.19 NM approximately. It is
also to be noted that subsequent to the receipt of the above infor-
mation, the Court also had it confirmed by a letter dated 27th
March, 1992.
VOR at Imphal:
VOR facilities at Imphal is being provided by utilising the
equipment WILCOX 476A, which was commissioned in September
1977. The facility was flight tested on 4.6.1991 and its operational
status was declared unrestricted. The VOR at Imphal operates on
frequency 116.9 MHz with identification code IIM.
Perusal of records indicated that VOR maintenance person-
nel at Imphal were taking meter readings of the equipment. periodi-
cally and also was carrying monthly ground checks. It has been
seen from the equipment log book that on 16.8.1991 VOR at
Imphal was working satisfactorily at the time of accident of Indian
Airlines Boeing 737 aircraft.
This VOR facility was flight inspected after the accident on
18.8.1991 to ascertain its status. During this flight check all
71

parameters of Transmitter-1 and II were within specified limits
expect 30 Hz. Reference level of Transmitter-1 was high (actual
reading 17.6 against the limit of 15 to 17). During the time of
accident Transmitter-II of VOR was in operation on 16.8.1991.
Regarding flight inspection of VOR and ILS at Imphal under-
taken by Flight Inspection Unit of NAA on 18.8.1991 (after the
accident) it was confirmed by NAA that "VOR - all parameters have
been found to be within defined limits. VOR Tx.2 which was in
operation of 16.8.1991 VOR let down procedure checked and fly-
able.
ILS - Tx.1 of localizer and Tx.1 of glide path were in opera-
tion on 16.8.1991. Except for the course line• alignment of localiz-
er, all other parameters of localizer and glide path were within
limits. Localizer course line was out by 21.9 UA against ICAO
specification of 15 UA for the same". DGCA representative was on
board for these flights.
Distance Measuring Equipment (DME)
:
One of the most debated issues before the Court of Inquiry is
in regard to the non-availability of Distance Measuring Equipment
(DME) at Imphal Airport. Whereas the operator along with the
ICPA submitted that in the event of there being a DME, this par-
ticular accident would not have taken place as the equipment is
the only instrument from which the pilot is in a position to know
his distance from a particular fix at any airport.
Admittedly and there is no manner of doubt that DME is a
very useful navigational aid and is of very great assistance to the
pilot in measuring his distance from VOR or ILS as the case may
be. But the issue arises whether non-availability of DME can be
ascribed to be the cause of the accident or even contributed to the
accident. Before recording my own finding in regard thereto the
evidence tendered before the Court ought to be considered.
72

Mr. S.K. Rastogi, Senior Aerodrome Officer, Incharge Imphal
Airport, has stated that a DME is useful both for the pilots as well
as for the Control Tower for the purpose of finding distance from
the aircraft to the runway. Incidentally it is to be noted that all
Boeing aircraft are fitted with a DME to correspond with a match-
ing ground equipment. Mr. Rastogi, however, stated that in the
absence of a DME there ought not to be any difficulty in the matter
of measurement of a distance though by an indirect method. Mr.
Rastogi explained the method being based on the ground speed
and the distance from stations 'A' to 'B' in comparison with time.
Though however, he has clearly admitted that this measurement
would be by estimation only and which may differ by one or two
nautical miles at best, it is the definite statement of Mr. Rastogi
that apart from this estimation the pilot is getting certain other
navigational aids enroute like VOR from where lie can take his
position and be more accurate as to how much time lie should
take therefrom. It is on evidence that by comparing the previous
reporting position and the time one can easily make out the dis-
tance lie shall have to cover. In general Mr. Rastogi's evidence is to
the effect that there ought not to be any difficulty in the matter of
safe arrival of the aircraft at a particular airfield even without
having a Distance Measuring Equipment though it is very much
desirable to have such an equipment at the station since it can
give the distance without any further calculation. Mr. Rastogi
further stated that in the event of disorientation of the pilot, the
DME would be of very great assistance.
Capt. Mehta when asked specifically about the importance
and usefulness of this particular equipment, categorically stated
that DME does not form part of the standard ILS procedure but if
it is available it will definitely help. According to him DME can be
termed to be an additional assistance to the pilot. Capt. Mehta
agreed with the view that there arc other ground aids available at
the Iniphal airport and the pilot can very easily navigate the air-
craft provided of course he follows and adheres to the laid down
73

procedures. Capt. A. Raliut also has stated that DME is a helpful
guide.
Mr. Satendra Singh has also stated that DME would be an
extremely helpful guide though cannot be termed to be a very
essential requirement.
The evidence so far disclosed before the Court, therefore,
leaves no manner of doubt that the DME is a helpful navigational
aid, but cannot be termed to be an essential navigational aid since
in the event of there being no DME, the pilot can co-relate his
distance from the earlier reporting point as also from overhead
VOR by calculation on tunings. Incidentally, it is to be noted that.
the pilot has been given the let down chart of ILS on the basis of
timings and speed and not on the basis of a distance. It is a time-
oriented chart and not a distance-oriented one. The factum of
time-orientation is fully within the knowledge of the pilots who fly
into Imphal. It is to be noted further that there arc approximately
on an average two flights a day to Imphal and the pilots have been
operating there without DME for the last several years.
This observation of mine ought not to be interpreted as
undermining the importance and the assistance rendered by DME.
I wish to clarify that absence of DME cannot be termed to be the
cause of the accident since even without DME safe landing is
otherwise possible with the assistance of other navigational and
landing aids at hnphal Airport.
Let us now consider the converse situation also: this particu-
lar pilot Capt. Sekhar Haider immediately after crossing overhead
Comilla has been giving wrong call-outs both in regard to alti-
tude and distance as more fully appear from the CVR/FDR co-
relation note above. The front panel instrument would definitely
give an indication as to whether he was overhead VOR or not. The
pilot unfortunately did not even bother to proceed on the basis of
the panel instruments - had he followed the same, question of this
1
74

inquiry would not have arisen. There is not only non-adherence to
the ILS let down chart but a total disregard of the front pallet
instruments - where is the guarantee, though may be a presump-
tion, that the pilot would have adhered to the DME even if that was
available. I have no hesitation to record that the entire course of
conduct of the pilot after the aircraft has left overhead Comilla is
rather slip shod and a total disregard for all normal procedures
which a pilot is supposed to follow. It is to be further recorded that
the CVR transcript does not show any emergency of any nature
being experienced by the pilots at the cockpit. The attitude is as
appears from the CVR transcript one of total cool and as stated by
Capt. M.V.V. Rao as a copy-book transmission which when co-
related with FDR depicts otherwise. As a matter of fact Capt. Rao
himself has stated that he would not have given him the conunand
licence if this FDR was made available to him after his command
check. I am indeed sorry to record the same but unfortunately I
am rather helpless considering the facts of the matter under inves-
tigation. Obviously, a sense of complacency has developed which
has prompted the pilot to proceed in a manner as he has done
while operating the flight from Calcutta to Imphal on the fateful
day.
The other aspect of the matter ought not also to be lost sight
of since a Distance Measuring Equipment was received admittedly
at Imphal in July, 1991. In the normal course of events, one
would expect that an equipment costing about rupees one crore
would be immediately commissioned but this particular equipment
has been allowed to remain at the airport in an unpacked condi-
tion at least till after the accident - a situation which cannot by
any stretch be said to be warranted.
Automatic Direction Finder (ADF) - AD 200
:
During the course of hearing, both Capt. Bagchi appearing
for the Indian Air Passengers Association and Capt. Mulherkar
appearing for Indian Commercial Pilots' Association, in no uncer-
tain terms suggested that if AD 200 was available with the Imphal
75

Air Traffic Control, the Controller would have known the direction
of the aircraft and thereby could have saved the accident.
AD-200 is a VDF equipment and its usefulness cannot in
any way be decried, but with the advancement of technological and
scientific instrumentation of navigational aids, the absence of AD-
200s is not felt in the same way as it used to be about a decade
ago. The installation of VOR at the Indian airports has done away
with the use of the AD-200s in this country. Admittedly, flying in
these days has become totally pilot-oriented. AD-200 would tiot
any way assist the pilot on board the aircraft but it is a ground
equipment through which the Controller can identify the direction
of the aircraft and considering therefore the recent pilot-oriented
approach, the National Airports Authority thought it fit to replace
the AD-200s by installation of VORs.
It is placed on record that I had the painful duty of investi-
gating another air accident involving an F-27 aircraft (VT -DMC)
belonging to Vayudoot on 19th October, 1988 near Guwahati,
Assam. In course of that investigation also the issue was raised
and when asked the then Coordinating Director Mr. Tekchandani
submitted a brief note which was quoted at page 80 of the Report.
For convenience sake the same is also quoted hereinbelow
"The AD-200 model of VDF equipment was available at
many aerodromes in this country till around
1978/1980. The equipment in use had been serving
at these airfields for over three decades and it had
become increasingly difficult to maintain these equip-
ments in serviceable condition because of the ageing of
the equipment and non-availability of spare parts due
to obsolescence. After careful consideration of various
aspects including maintainability of the equipment
upto prescribed standards, their necessity vis-a-vis the
availability of more advanced Nav aids like VOR, the
then DGCA decided to withdraw these equipment
gradually from service. AD-200C, a later version of
AD-200 was the last to be withdrawn from service in
this Region at Bhubaneswar some time in 1988 when
it was no longer possible to maintain the facility to
desired standards.
76

On the question of its replacement by latest version, I
would like to submit that the same was not considered
necessary because. the VOR, considered an advanced
pilot interpreted and more versatile aid has been
provided at most of the airports and the NAA is in the
process of providing more VOR coverage of the Indian
air space. Obvious advantage of the VOR over the AD-
200 as a direction finder lies in the fact that the pilot
can have its bearing with reference to the VOR tuned
by him from the appropriate instrument in the cockpit
continuously, whereas in the case of AD-200 the bear-
ing of the aircraft derived at the ground had to be
communicated by the Air Traffic Control to the aircraft
whenever desired or•necessary. The only advantage of
AD-200 over VOR, if it can be so termed, lies in the
fact that the ATC would know the direction of the
aircraft in the case of AD-200 and not in the case of
VOR which is a pilot interpreted aid.
I may also add that the latest generation of VDF
equipment of the type in use at four international
airports (imported from USA manufactured by Servo
Corporation) is not indigenously available and that it is
a costly equipment.
Considering the huge cost involved in providing the
VDF equipment at all the airports in the country par-
ticularly in hard foreign currency, it would be appreci-
ated by His Lordship and the Learned Assessors that
NAA can go for this only at the cost of its present plans
to improve and modernise the communication and
Navigational aids in more crucial areas."
The findings on this particular issue so far as the earlier
investigation is concerned ought also to be noted. At page 81 of
the earlier report my observations to the following effect were
recorded :-
"While it is true that AD-200 is an out-dated machin-
ery, but its importance and usefulness cannot be
decried. But considering the improved phenomenon of
the ground aids, in my view, it would not be fair to put
any `b lame on to the National Airports Authority as was
sought to have been done by various parties appearing
before the Court of Inquiry. With the AD-200, the
ground control is in a position to know the location of
the aircraft and in the earlier days used to communi-
cate the same to the aircraft, but with the introduction
of VOR, the same being now considered to be a pilot
interpreted instrument and a more effective aid so that
the pilot-in-command himself is in a position to locate
his locations rather than depending upon the ground
77

A
control to inform him. In that view of the matter,
installation of further AD-200s on the threshold of the
21st century, in my view, does not warrant further
consideration and I accept the submissions made by
Mr. Tekchandani on behalf of the National Airports
Authority."
In the present context also since there is no new material on
record or any additional evidence being adduced before the Court
justifying a different view, I do not intend to retract from the earlier
observations, but reiterate the same and note that with the ad-
vancement of technology question of introduction of AD-200 at this
stage does not arise. It is not a replacement for a radar though a
definite land aid which has lost its importance in the present day
coil! ext
Locator Beacons :
As narrated above the Instrument Landing System caters for
the existence of an outer marker signal - it may be through a fan
marker and a locator beacon or only a fan marker. Whereas the
fan marker has a limited vertical range with a cone over which it
provides audio and visual indications, the locator beacon is a non-
directional beacon having a much wider range and would thus be a
more positive assistance to the pilot in the matter of locating his
position vis-a-vis the outer marker. The locator beacon will indi-
cate as to the direction of the outer marker so as to allow the pilot
to take corrective measures if there be any. Locator beacon is an
additional assistance but cannot as such be termed to be an
essential navigational equipment in an 1LS procedure. Needless to
say, however, that existence of a fan marker will suffice in so far as
the safety aspect is concerned, more so by reason of the fact that
the pilot is supposed to follow the procedure in its observance
rather than in its deviations. At the Imphal Airport, there is a fan
marker which gives both audio and the light blip and that by itself,
in my view, would be a sufficient protection to the pilot for a sale
landing. As noted above, locator beacon is an additional assist-
ance and it is always better to have a further assistance if that is
78

available. Locator beacon is nothing but a low powered NDB
through which the pilots arc in a position to locate the outer
marker with exactitude. It cannot thus, therefore, be regarded as a
mandatory essential navigational aid but an additional assistance.
It is on record that on the fateful day tile fan markers at the outer
marker and the middle marker locations duly emitted both audio
and visual signals even Just before the unfortunate crash as re-
ported by Capt. L.P. Mishra being the Pilot-in-Command of flight
IC-889 on 16th August, 1991. For convenience sake relevant
extract of his statement is quoted hereinbelow
"While operating flight IC-889 (Guwahati-Imphal) we
approached Imphal on radial 282 (102° inbound) we
were cleared to FL 100 and we checked overhead and
proceeded outbound on 217 directly as it was not
possible to Join the hold as there was a cell. We did a
normal L/D VOR and ILS landed normally. Naviga-
tional Aids at that time were functioning normal.
Outer Marker (fan marker) we received both Audio and
Visual signals besides we also monitored the L/D
down on our ND/(Navigation Display)."
Capt. K. Patel, Commander of Hight IC-255/256
on 16th
August, 1991, landed at Imphal at about. 1205 hrs. approximately,
did not also report the non-availability of the outer marker signals.
For convenience sake, the relevant extract from the statement of
Capt. Patel is noted hereinbelow :-
"I operated IC-255 Calcutta-Silchar-Imphal ill morning
departure was about 0615 hrs. in morning. When we
approach overhead Silchar visibility at Silchar dropped
to 1000M with rain and low clouds. As, weather was
below our minima, I diverted to Imphal which reported
7 kills. visibility and light drizzle. I carried out VOR
ILS procedure and landed at Imphal. Weather was low
clouds and visibility 7 kips. We sighted runway at
about Outer Marker. Navigation aids at this time was
working normal. After approximately 1 hour 45
minutes when Silcher improved we continued our
flight to Silchar and Imphal. Second time when we
landed at Imphal weather given was 5000 mfrs. and
sky was overcast. I carried out VOR ILS and again
sighted runway on Outer Marker. All navigational aids
were working normally. For both the ILS approaches
at Imphal I have reported overhead VOR at 10000 feet
and Join the hold to descend to 8000 feet and proceed
79

to outbound descending to 5000 feet and then descend
to 4200 feet in procedure turn.
Even if the conditions arc WIZ, I will carry out VOR
ILS procedure, keeping in view the terrain in the vicini-
ty of the airport (cid:9)
While on ILS we cross check our height over outer
marker 4,020 feet by audio and visual signal of marker
(inbound)."
Incidentally, it is to be noted that immediately after the
crash the particular chamiel of the ILS was sealed and the system
was calibrated in the morning of 18th August, 1991 by the Nation-
al Airports Authority with a representative of Director General of
Civil Aviation on board the calibration aircraft. The calibration re
sults depict that "on that day the transmitter (1) of the localizer
and transmitter (1) of the glide path were in operation. Post acci-
dent calibration was carried out on 18th Aug. 1991. Except for the
course line alignment of the localizer, all other parameters of the
localizer and glide path were within limits."
From the report of the Shri K.V.N. Murthy, Executive Direc-
tor, National Airports Authority, it appears that though there is
slight deviation in the course line aligmnent of the localizer but the
deviation is not to such an extent so as to alter the flight path of
the aircraft since the deviation is to the extent of about 50 feet
only. The glide path as noted above in the report, is in operation
and there is no other infirmity in the equipments. In order to
appreciate, however, the slight deviation in the course line align-
ment of localizer, I have had a discussion with Mr. K.V.N. Murthy,
Executive Director (IP), the National Airports Authority and I did
ask him to submit a report in regard thereto. For convenience
sake, the same is set out hereinbelow
"The Flight Inspection Reports Nos. 1660 & 1660A
indicate a course alignment of 21.9 micro amp. for
both Transim► itter 1 and Transmit to 2 of the Localiser
at Imphal. This indicates that the course line informa-
tion observed at the landing threshold would be dis-
placed by 51.1 feet i.e. if the pilot follows the Localiser
centre-line information, lie would find himself 51.5 feet
80

away from the actual centre line of the licaliser at the
threshold. As per ICAO, the permissible limit for such
a displacement is 35 tee t for Cat. I systems. This
displacement was corrected by subsequent mainte-
nance and correct adjustment confirmed by Flight
Inspection Report No.1662.
The Flight Inspection Reports mentioned above,
however, indicate that the structure of the localiser
course to be well within tolerance i.e. there were no
bends in the localiser beam."
The calibration report of the National Airports Authority is
also annexed hereto and marked with letter 'G'.

10. SEARCH AND RESCUE :
The Inspector of Accidents Mr. R.K. Paul, who visited the
crash site, in his report has stated as follows :-
"After duty ATCO Mr. Sen Gupta failed to establish
contact with IC-257, he informed Shri S.K. Rastogi,
Senior Aerodrome Officer (SAO) incharge of the aero-
drome who immediately came and took over control
and initiated different phases of emergency procedure.
Several calls were given to IC-257. Also IC-890 and
IC-256 (on ground at Imphal) called IC-257 but there
was no response.
At 1248 hrs. IST Fire Station was alerted to keep a
look out for IC-257. Indian Airlines was also informed
and advised to contact IC-257 on their company
channel.
IC-890 which was just airborne, was requested to
proceed about 10/12 miles soul► -west of 11111 at
10,000 feet to find out IC-257. But. due to cloud it was
not possible to look out for IC-257 and this aircraft
then set course for Guwahati. In the meantime, blind
calls were given to IC-257 stating that it was cleared to
land on runway 04 (considering communication fail-
ure).
It was determined from Indian Airlines that there were
62+1 passengers on board. At 1255 hrs. IST full
emergency was-declared. Fire station was advised
accordingly with instructions to position their crash
fire tender etc. to handle IC-257. City Fire
Brigade/S.P. Fire, Imphal were contacted and request-
ed to keep their crash tender ready for assistance.
Deputy Commissioner & Supdt. of Police, Imphal were
then informed about the missing aircraft. On the final
approach and requested to intimate D.C./S.P., 131sh-
nupur District which falls on the final approach path
since the aircraft is likely to be found in that area.
Guwahati and Calcutta were informed through
HF/R.T. Regional Medical College and Ambulance
Services and S.P. (CID) were informed. By 1305 IST all
these agencies had been informed.
D.C. Imphal contacted to know the position of the
aircraft and he was advised to organise search and
rescue within or exceeding 5-15 miles south-West of
tine airport.

1C-256 which was cleared for departure at 1310 MT,
was advised to search for IC-257, but due to cloud, he
flew for about 5/6 minutes without. any success and
then set course for Si'char.
By 1330 hrs. IST Senior Aerodrome Officer (SAO)
constituted Search and Rescue party. In the mean-
time, SAO also instructed aerodrome office to inform
Delhi Hqrs., Chief Secretary, Joint Secretary (Home),
Manipur regarding the situation.
I.G. Police and S.P. Imphal came to airport at 1335
hrs. IST and were briefed about the situation and also
informed that the aerodrome search and rescue party
was leaving for probable crash site towards Moirang.
Search and Rescue Party started from airport at 1350
hrs. 1ST and reached the Office of the d.C. Bisimupur
around 1600 hrs. On reaching the office of the d.C.
Bislinupur, it was learnt that D.C. /S.P. have left
towards Moirang along with rescue team. The aero-
drome search add rescue party came back to airport at
1650 hrs. IST. At 1658 hrs. 1ST it was learnt from
State Authority that sonic villagers had informed that
the aircraft had crashed at Thangling hill just about
22 NM from the aerodrome. The message was relayed
to Guwahati and Calcutta. However, SAO contacted
D:C: Imphal about this message but was told that. the
authenticity of the message could be verified only after
the rescue team reaches the site which would take
about 5/6 hours due to very difficult terrain.
While search and rescue was being organised, S.P.,
Churachandpur, Mr. K.H. Netra received information
around 1430 hrs. IST regarding the crash of I.A.
Boeing aircraft through police radio control. He was
asked to organise search party for locating the missing
aircraft.
Mr. Netra got information around 1720 lirs. from
S.D.P.O., Churachandpur that one villager reported to
Moirang Police Station about one aircraft crashed at
Thanging hill range. He along with his men, theretbre,
proceeded to the crash site. It was heavily raining and
almost dark at. that time. They could reach to Than
gJ
ing hill around 22:30 hrs. IST which is under t he
jurisdiction of Churachandpur. They saw one dead
body and also experienced smell of burning oil. While
proceeding further, they found more dead bodies and
finally located the site. He found the aircraft was
broken to pieces with dead bodies around it. There
was no fire but smoke was emitting. He ascertained
that there was no survivors.
Due to difficult terrain, heavy rain and dark night, lie
along with police force waited till dawn.
83

S.P. Churachandpur stated that 12 bodies were
evacuated on 17.8.1991, 40 bodies on 18.8.1991 and
remaining 17 bodies on 19.8.1991. On completion of
the rescue work, all the bodies were brought down to
the base camp at the foot hill by road with the help of
police, B.S.F and other para-military forces and volun-
tary organisations. Finally, on completion of the
rescue work, S.P. left the crash site after arranging to
guard the place. The rescue work was also assisted by
Manipur Rifle, B.S.F. and S.R.P.F.
Regional Controller of Air Safety, Calcutta and Senior
Air Safety Officer (Ops.) were informed by Deputy
Director Aerodrome, Shri G. Sarkar about this missing
aircraft at around 1315 hrs. IST on 16.8.1991. Both
of them immediately arrived at the search and rescue
centre of Calcutta Airport. Information about locating
the aircraft on Thangjing hill was received at Calcutta
at around 17:00 hrs 1ST.
Honourable Minister for Civil Aviation, Secretary - Civil
Aviation, Director General of Civil Aviation, Deputy
Director General and Director of Air Safety arrived
Calcutta at night and on next morning they all left in a
special aircraft for Imphal. RCAS and SASO (Ops.)
also arrived Imphal by the same aircraft. By the time
the rescue operation was in full swing. As per the
information received from the Police Control at around
1700 hrs. on 17.8.1991, 52 bodies were recovered out
of which 12 were identified. By 19.8.1991, all bodies
were recovered and identified.
Crash site was on difficult hilly terrain about 6700 feet
ASL. Also due to inclement weather and difficult ter-
rain rescue operation became very difficult task."
This Court, however, is not in a position to appreciate the
role of the National Airports Authority in the matter of Search. and
Rescue. Mr. Rastogi, Senior Aerodrome Officer, and an official of
National Airports Authority in no uncertain terms has stated that
in the event of there being an air crash in the vicinity of the airport
only the National Airports Authority is expected to take steps for
search and rescue but not otherwise since that would be the
responsibility of the State Government. I am to record here my
total disagreement with this practice of the National Airports
Authority. The National Airports Authority is one of the principle
wings of the entire Civil Aviation industry in this country and it is
true that their functions are specified but that, however, does not
84

mean and imply that there shall not be any obligation on their part
to be a party in the matter of search and rescue in an air crash,
even if the crash takes place at a place which cannot. be said to be
within the vicinity of the airport. Mr. Rastogi has been frank
enough to state before the Court that on the first information of the
crash near Loktak Lake in the afternoon of 16th August, 1991, he
went along with the police officials but when nothing was found in
and around the area of Loktak Lake, he came back without any
further attempt to locate the wreckage. He is quite content in
informing the Deputy Commissioner of Police to look for the air-
craft. I did not find in him even at the witness box any anxiety in
locating the crash site. As a matter of fact, according to his own
statement, he got the information about the crash site next day
morning when all the newspapers in the country reported the
accident including its location. Is it expected of a Civil Aviation
industry man to know of the crash site on the next. morning, in city
view, the answer cannot be in the affirmative. Safety of the people
ought to be the foremost consideration for a Civil Aviation industry
man in the country. Assuming there were some survivors, what
would have happened to them if no medical attention was made
available within shortest possible time - one does not know. Mr.
Rastogi is the man on-the-spot, if he takes this attitude and sticks
to his duty chart, it would be deemed to be a very sad day for the
Civil Aviation industry in.the country. The obligation to render
assistance under any circumstances should be a prime considera-
tion to an Aerodrome Officer. As a matter of fact, Mr. Rastogi's
entire conduct does not seem to be in consonance with a sense of
public safety and when the aircraft is to land, lie is quite content. to
be "in his chamber and talking to the clients." That is the attitude
which has been exhibited even in Court and which by no stretch
according to me is proper. I am conscious of the fact that the
Senior Aerodrome Officer has had some administrative work to do
but that does not, however, mean and imply that when there were
only three flights and all restricted by about mid afternoon, the
Senior Aerodrome Officer will be in his Chamber talking to his
clients at the time of the flight. There must be an anxiety in the
85

mind of the Senior Aerodrome Officer as to how things are proceed-
ing at the Control Tower - there ought to be a sense of belonging to
an Officer and lie must be sincere for the purpose for which lie has
been asked to be there to cater for safety of the aircraft including
the passengers. Does the conduct of the Senior Aerodrome Officer
show such an anxiety or sincerity - I am afraid the answer cannot
but be in the negative. It is true that Mr. Rastogi is a trained and
experienced Officer, but the country has not been able to obtain
the benefit of his training or his experience - a state of affairs
which cannot by any stretch be said to be very encouraging. It is
for the National Airports Authority to inculcate a sense of belong-
ing on to its Officers so that public safety in not in any way im-
paired or there is any compromise iii regard thereto.
Merely by sending an intimation to the police authorities, in
my view, will not do - further steps arc required to be taken which
Mr. Rastogi, according to me, has failed.
On the basis of available materials on record, it appears that
immediately on coming to know of the factum of the missing air-
craft, the officials of the National Airports Authority, Calcutta,
telephonically informed Mr. R.K. Paul, Regional Controller of Air
Safety, Calcutta, who was later appointed as the Inspector of
Accidents in this investigation and Shri Paul, on his part, also
informed Shri Satendra Singh, Director Air Safety, in the DGCA
Headquarters at New Delhi. According to Mr. Paul, it was almost
certain that the aircraft had crashed. Subsequent crash informa-
tion, however, was updated as and when further information was
received from Imphal through the National Airports Authority,
Calcutta. Finally, however, the information was received that the
crash site has been located around 1700 hours on 16.8.1991 by a
villager, which is at a distance of about 20.5 nautical miles from
the hnphal Airport. The relief aircraft was made ready by the
Indian Airlines, but the flight did not leave by reason of night
landing restrictions at Imphal. As a matter of fact, the Minister of
Civil Aviation Shri Madhav Rao Scindia arrived at Calcutta at night
86

itself so as to reach Imphal at the first available opportunity next
day morning. It is to be noted that the Civil Aviation Minister
proceeded to Imphal along with the Secretary, Civil Aviation De-
partment; Director General of Civil Aviation; Deputy Director
General of Civil Aviation; Director Air Safety, Hqrs. DGCA at New
Delhi; Chairman Indian Airlines; Member Operations, National
Airports Authority and the other local DGCA and Indian Airlines
officials together with the relatives of the passengers on that 111-
fated flight.
I have been informed that inunediately on arrival at Imphal,
the site was surveyed by the Minister-in-Charge of Civil Aviation in
a helicopter provided by the Indian Air force. The Indian Airlines
engineers and DGCA representatives had trekked to the site. It is
not out of place to mention that the hill which was a mute specta-
tor to the accident, was above 5,500 feet hi height and the passage
to the crash site was for all practical purposes out of bound to all
and sundry, more so by reason of the fact of the heavy rain and
slushy and steep terrain.
It appears from the report of the Inspector of Accidents that
one Shri Thongram Birjit Singh brought the Cockpit Voice Record-
er from the crash site and deposited with Bishenpur Police Station.
The Inspector of Accident's Report also shows that one Shri Zamlet
Haokip was the first person who knew that the aircraft accident
had taken place at Thangjing Hill and one Shri Shanikhalien
Haokip, was the first person who informed the Police Station about
the aircraft accident. The report further disclosed that Slid K.H.
Netra, Supdt. of Police, Churachandpur, received information
around 1430 hours on 16.8.1991 regarding a missing Indian Air-
lines Boeing aircraft through a Police radio with the instructions to
organise a search party for locating the missing aircraft. Initially
Mr. Netra proceeded to Loktak Lake but subsequently around 1700
hours came to know that the aircraft, in fact, had crashed at
Thangjing Hill range under Moirang Police Station. The Report of
Mr. Netra records that after reaching the crash site, he found that
87

the aircraft was broken into pieces with dead bodies around it.
Though there was no fire but smoke was still emitting rciicl it was
clear to them that, there would be no survivors. Mr. Netra submit-
ted that since it was pitch dark and no torches were even available
excepting, however, the improvised fire which could be ignited,
they had no other alternative but to wait till dawn as it was diffi-
cult on that hour to start the salvage work in darkness and in
heavy rain.. The report of Shri Netra along with the report of Mr.
Priyokumar Singh being the Sub-Divisional Police Officer, Chura-
chandpur are annexed hereto and collectively marked with letter
'H'.
I would fail in my duty as a Chairman of this Court of In-
quiry if I do not mention the role and the effort of Manipur Adven-
ture and Allied Sports Institute, Implial (MAASI). The leader of the
rescue team Shri N.J.K. Singh along with about 20 other young
boys has not only rendered services but what I hear from other
sources the rescue operation would have been extremely difficult
without their active participation in such operation. I place on
record my deep sense of gratitude and my appreciation to the
leader Mr. N.J.K. Singh and his young friends for rendering such
invaluable services for the cause of humanity.
The services rendered by Manipur Rifles, Central Reserve
Police Force and Border Security Force also need special mention
and reference. MAASI volunteers together with Manipur Rifles,
Central Reserve Police Force and Border Security Force personnel
have made it possible for the bodies being brought down to the
base camp with extreme difficulty by improvised stretchers which
should command praise from every quarter, since no mode of
transportation could be made available from the crash site by
reason of the terrain and the slushy condition on the slopes of the
hill. The bodies had to be carried down personally on shoulders of
the volunteers and other pares-military force personnel. I was
informed that the path was so slushy and was having such a steep
slope that one person cannot even stand without a proper support
88

and even then MAASI volunteers and other para-military force
personnel did not hesitate to render all possible assistance under
the circumstances so that the bodies could be made over to the
relatives as quickly as it is practicable.
Incidentally, it is also to be noted that from the base station
upto the crash site, it has taken the search party about four hours
of very steep climb - nothing was available, even a glass of drinking
water and it Is the villagers of the nearby villages who -came for-
ward with all their might and provided the drinking water and even
some fruits-to the volunteers enroute to the crash point. The
gesture admittedly is admirable and I hereby record my sincere
appreciation and thanks to those villagers who have spared no
pains to be at different points enroute to the crash point to provide
these facilities to the volunteers as otherwise it would have been
extremely difficult if not impossible to bring down the bodies so
quickly on to the base camp.
On the basis of the evidence on record, the first batch of
bodies arrived at the base camp on 18th early morning and by
about 19th all the bodies arrived at the base camp and subse-
quently transferred to the mortuary for the post mortem examina-
tion and immediately thereafter the bodies were made available to
their relatives for the last rites. I also put on record my apprecia-
tion to Indian Airlines for allowing the relatives of the passengers of
the ill-fated flight to proceed on to Imphal by air and to return to
their respective destinations along with the bodies in wooden boxes
free of charge - an indeed laudable gesture. Special mention
should be had for Mr. Ramdas being the Chairman of Indian Air-
lines and Mr. Deb Burman, Deputy Director Commercial of Indian
Airlines along with some other Indian Airlines officials by reason of
their ardent effort to give solace and pacifying the relatives Mune-
diately after the crash. All the loved ones were there to have a last
glimpse and it is an extremely difficult situation to manage. I have
been told that both the above named officials of Indian Airlines
have conducted themselves in such a way which cannot but be
89

termed praise-worthy. I record my appreciation and sincere thanks
to them for their humane conduct and behaviour inside the
mortuary at Imphal.
In fine, considering the location of the crash site and consid-
ering the slushy terrain, I am of the opinion that the search and
rescue operation proceeded in a manner as is expected in such
circumstances and no further, better or quicker arrangement could
have been made.

11. WRECKAGE INFORMATION :
Details of wreckage information would appear from the
report of the Inspector of Accidents and for convenience sake, the
same is quoted hereinbelow
"This aircraft impacted on the hill at a point approxi-
mately 200 feet from the top of Thangjing hill which is
located 20.5 NM South-West of Imphal Aerodrome with
a bearing of 220° from VOR. Although the aircraft had
broken to pieces, wreckage was limited to a small area
(400M X 100M) and could be viewed from the top of
the hill. The inclination of the slope at the point of
impact is about 60° to 70°. The major parts of the
airplane were strewn with the empennage of the air-
craft at the lower most point of the crash site. One
wing was found to the left and another similar struc-
ture to the right. These were almost half-way of the
crash site (longitudinally). Just above the right hand
side wing, was one undercarriage identified as 1,11
undercarriage. The nose wheel was almost on lime lop
of the crash site. Due to massive destruction and
parts disturbed by the local inhabitants, it was not
possible to co-relate many positions during this
wreckage examination. Also, there was post-accident
fire which destroyed parts.
However, it could be determined that the landing gear
was in UP position as found from the landing gear
operating actuator. Fore, mid and aft flaps were seen
along with right hand wing separated from the fuse-
lage. The flaps were out which corresponds to ap-
proach position. The horizontal stabilizer was cut off
about 30" from extreme outboard end and right hand
horizontal stabilizer was in one piece. Rear pressure
bulkhead was separated from the fuselage. The fin,
which separated out was clearly visible with 1.A.
monogram while engine was traced on the L.H. side,
another engine casing was lying on the L.H. side of
crash site."
Mr. D.K. Roy, the Deputy Engineering Manager of Indian
Airlines at Calcutta, being one of the persons who also reached the
crash site has stated that there was practically no road and it was
the very tough journey. Mr. Roy stated that while he was going up,
he found quite a lot of people coming down from the crash site with
small articles belonging to the aircraft. At the crash site, the CVR
was found out by one of the technicians of Indian Airlines being
91

carried by one person on his back. There was also a photographer
and the latter was asked to take the photograph of the man carry-
ing the CVR. The matter was reported thereafter to the police and
the man was traced out and the CVR was recovered without there
being any damage and with proper seals. The FDR also was locat-
ed somewhere else around 30 kms away from the crash point in a
village and was hidden in a banana bush. This FDR would not
have been recovered but by reason of a generous taxi driver who
came and reported the factum of the removal of the FDR from the
crash site to a village and hiding it under a banana bush by a
villager. It is to be placed on record that the FDR was recovered
without also there being any further damage to the recorder ex-
cepting the impact damage. A wreckage distribution chart for
convenience sake, is also annexed hereto and marked with letter
T.

12. GENERAL OUTLINE OF INVESTIGATION BY THE COURT
OF INQUIRY :
Government of India vide Notification No.AV.15013 /5/91-
SSV dated 26th September, 1991 constituted the Court of Inquiry
under Rule 75 of the Aircraft Rules, 1937, wherein I was appointed
for the formal investigation of the crash of the Indian Airlines flight
being No. IC-257 (the route being Calcutta-Imphal-Dimapur) On
16th August, 1991, near Thangjing Hill at Imphal, Manipur, to lie
assisted by Mr. B.P. Baliga, a former Director of Engineering, Air
India and Wing Cdr. P. Ashoka, Executive Director, Hindustan
Aeronautics Limited, as Assessors. Mr. A.K. Sinha, Senior Air
Safety Officer, in the Directorate of Director General of Civil Avia-
tion, Calcutta, was appointed as the Secretary to the Court of
Inquiry. The Court was requested to submit its report by 31st
December, 1991, but subsequently, however, the time was extend-
ed till 30th April, 1992.
It is to be noted that Mr. R.K. Paul, Regional Controller of Air
Safety in the Directorate of Director General of Civil Aviation,
Calcutta, was appointed as the Inspector of Accidents by the Direc-
tor General of Civil Aviation immediately after the unfortunate
crash on 16th August, 1991.
On the constitution of the Court, Mr. Paul did call on me and
apprised me of the work which has already been done by him
including examination of sonic witnesses. I requested Mr. Paul to
continue and complete his investigation in the matter with utmost
expedition.
On 8th October, 1991, I along with the Assessors named
above, together with the Director General of Civil Aviation Mr. M.R.
Sivaraman, Deputy Director General of Civil Aviation Mr. H.S.
Khola, Director Air Safety in the Directorate of the Director General
of Civil Aviation Headquarters Mr. Satendra Singh, the Inspector of
Accident Mr. R.K. Paul and the Secretary to the Court of Inquiry
Mr. A.K. Sinha reached Imphal for the purpose of an on-the-spot
93

survey of the crash site and obtaining necessary details in regard
to the crash of the aircraft (VT-EFL). The Indian Air Force authori-
ties did provide a helicopter for the purpose of a survey of the
crash site, but in spite of our best efforts by hovering over the area.
in question in the helicopter, the survey was not possible by reason
of the inclement weather conditions and the Thangjing Hill being
overcast with clouds.
I, however, did have detailed discussions with the State
Police and the aerodrome officials as also the doctors who per-
formed the post mortem examinations of the bodies of the passen-
gers and that of the crew members of the ill-fated aircraft. Next
day morning also there was an attempt to have an on-the-spot
survey but continuance of inclement weather prevented us from
being at the crash site.
On return to Calcutta, however, I along with the officials of
the DGCA and my Assessors inspected the engineering division at
the hangars of Indian Airlines at Calcutta and ascertained the
mode and method of doing the overnight checks. The Chief Engi-
neering Manager Mr. S. R. Chakravarty and the Deputy Engineer-
ing Manager Mr. D.K. Roy, along with other engineering personnel
of Indian Airlines assisted us whilst at the hangars. The Regional
Director of Indian Airlines, Calcutta Region, Mr. U.P. Singh, was
also present at the discussions. There were further discussions
with the Executive Director, Calcutta, NAA Mr. S.C. Goswami and
the Director of Aerodromes, NAA Mr. H.S. Roy.
On 1 lth October, 1991, I proceeded to Delhi for an assess-
ment of the CVR transcript and FDR read-out which had already
been effected by Mr. Satendra Singh, Director Air Safety at DGCA
Headquarters. The two assessors were also present at the time of
such an assessment of the CVR transcript and FDR read-out. At
Delhi I met the Joint Secretary, Ministry of Civil Aviation, Mr.
Ravindra Gupta, as also the Director General of Civil Aviation and
the other top officials in the Directorate. At Delhi I had detailed
94

discussions with the then Chairman-cum-Managing Director of the
Indian Airlines Air Marshal S.S. Ramdas. the Chairman of the
National Airports Authority Air Marshal C.K.S. Raje, the Member
Operations National Airports Authority AVM. H.M. Shahul, the
Director of Operations Indian Airlines Capt. R.K. Kakkar and the
Director of Flight Safety Capt. P.M. Jog. I also had a meeting with
the Boeing Company's representative in India together with the
representatives of Pratt & Whitney, the manufacturers of Boeing-
737 engines in regard to the issue of engine failure as also the
Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS). The shearing of
engines was also discussed at the meeting. There was a further
meeting with the Pratt & Whitney representative at my residence at
Calcutta on 14th October, 1991, wherein the issues as regards age
of the engines and the engine failure were discussed at length.
In order to be certain about the structural stability of the
aircraft on 20th October, 1991, I visited Bangalore and had dis-
cussions about the same including information on stress and
strain analysis of the aircraft components with Prof. R. Narasimha,
Director, National Aeronautical Laboratory (NAL), along with other
officials of NAL in the presence of the Assessors. It is indeed not
out of place to record that having detailed discussions in regard to
the structural stability of the aircraft (VT-EFL), it came to light that
question of there being a structural failure does not arise.
While the preliminary investigations were being carried out, I
directed my Secretary to cause necessary advertisement to be
published in all leading newspapers of the country so that any
person having any knowledge and who desires to make a represen-
tation concerning the circumstances or the cause of the accident
may do so in writing in the form of an affidavit sworn before a
notary public or a Magistrate first class or any Metropolitan Magis-
trate and address the same to the Secretary, Court of Inquiry as
constituted by the Govermnent Notification noted above for investi-
gation of the cause of the accident to the Indian Airlines Boeing
737 aircraft VT-EFL near Imphal. The advertisement was duly
95

published in all leading dailies of the country including the local
newspapers at Manipur and Nagaland on oraboul 27th October,
1991.
To ascertain the flight path followed by the aircraft which
ultimately resulted in the crash, I visited Bombay on 9th Novem-
ber, 1991 to have a simulator flight at the Air India A-310 simula-
tor, on the basis of the FDR read-outs. Incidentally, it is to be
noted that the A-310 simulator is one of the most modern and
sophisticated simulator available presently throughout the globe
and the effort was to obtain the flight path on the computer in
order to avoid ally misconception about the path followed by the
aircraft. I record my sincere appreciation to Air India and in par-
ticular its Director of Operations Capt. D:S. Mathur and the
Deputy Director Capt. J.R. Trilokekar and the other instructors of
Air India who have assisted in such a simulation flight and obtain-
ing a computer print out of the flight path on the basis thereof.
On 13th November, 1991, I visited the Civil Aviation Training
College of National Airports Authority at Allahabad in order to
obtain a first-hand information about the training system of the Air
Traffic Control Officers. At the training institute, detailed discus-
sions were had in the presence of my Assessors with the Member
Operations AVM H.M. Shahul and other NAA officials. The entire
syllabi was made available to us as also the methods of teaching
and practical training aspects were noted.
On 16th November, 1991, 1 did visit the training institute of
Indian Airlines at Hyderabad for the purposes of ascertaining the
training course of Pilots as also to note the practical training
aspect. Whilst at Hyderabad I took the opportunity of having a
further simulation flight on 13-737 simulator in order to ascertain
the flight path of the aircraft.
In order to have the public hearings of the Court of Inquiry, I
personally requested the Speaker of the West Bengal Legislative
96

Assembly Mr. Hasim. Abdul Halim to provide me the Counsel
Chamber (Syed Nausliar All Hall) and Mr. Halim was gracious
enough to acconunodate me and permitted this Court of Inquiry to
hold its sittings at the above Hall. I hereby record my sincere
thanks to Mr. Haliin for this accommodation. Needless to say that
the Court hadn't had to pay any charge therefor.
Further advertisements were published in the newspapers
for open sittings of the Court of Inquiry on and from 30th Novem-
ber, 1991. The Court did, in fact, commenced its proceedings on
and since the above noted date.
During the course of hearing, I felt that the flight path of
some of the earlier flights to Imphal undertaken by Capt. Shekhar
Halder as Pilot-in-Command ought also to be examined so as to
ascertain the mode and method of flying so far as Capt. Haldar is
concerned. In pursuance whereof, I directed the Indian Airlines to
make available to the Court at least four earlier flight data recorder
foils for the purpose of examination. The Indian Airlines did
comply with such a direction and made over four flight data re-
corder foils identifying the flights as that of Capt. Sekhar Haider on
Calcutta-Imphal route.
After the foils were made over to the Court, the same were
brought to Delhi by my Secretary and I personally supervised the
readings on the foils and obtained necessary details therefrom_ It
is to be noted that the foils were decoded by Mr. Satendra Singh,
Director Air Safety, DGCA Headquarters, and the FDR read-out for
all the four foils were made available to the Court. Subsequently I
directed the copies of the four FDRs to be circulated to all the
parties so that necessary submissions may be made in regard
thereto by the concerned parties.
Upon obtaining the four FDR read-outs, I directed Mr.
Satendra Singh to go to Hyderabad along with Capt. Willa, the
then Operations Manager, Indian Airlines, Calcutta Region, to
obtain a simulation path of the above noted four flights on the
97

Boeing 737 simulator and in accordance therewith within a short
while therefrom, the four several flight paths on the route Caleutta-
Imphal as plotted on a computer graph were made available to the
Court by Mr. Satendra Singh.
For further confirmation on to the flight path, I did visit
Bombay on 17th January, 1992 and had the simulator exercise
and also obtained the four flight paths of the aircraft in regard to
the above noted four FDRs.
Some confusion arose as the exact location of the crash site
during the hearing by reason of which I directed the Deputy Direc-
tor General of Civil Aviation to arrange for a further visit to Imphal
for an on-the-spot inquiry. To facilitate the issue necessary ar-
rangements were made to position an Emergency Locator Trans-
mitter (ELT) at the crash site so that while Hying on an A-320
aircraft necessary signals may be obtained in order to determine
the correct distance of the crash site from the VOR point. Indian
Space Research Organisation, Bangalore, was also requested to
pick up the signal through satellite and indicate the coordinates of
the source of signal. Though the ELT was placed at the crash site,
but unfortunately due to bad weather conditions as also non-avail-
ability of the VOR at Imphal airport the flight to Imphal via
Guwahati could not be operated on that day. The Bangalore Space
Research Centre, however, obtained the signals and submitted the
approximate coordinates of the crash site, but in order to confirm
the exact location, the Surveyor General of India was requested to
provide this Court with necessary coordinates which was made to
this Court by way of a certification as stated above, suffice however
to record here that the distance between the VOR Imphal and the
top of the Thangjing hill has been certified to be 20.19 NM.
At the hearing, the issue of clearance of the hill on pilot's
immediate reaction, upon the sounding of the GPWS came up for
consideration and in order to appreciate it better, I went to Hyd-
erabad on 1st March, 1992, and with the assistance of Capt.
Thargaonkar and Capt. DeCosta, I did have a simulation exercise
in regard thereto.

Altogether 25 Court sittings were held out of which 24 were
at Calcutta and one sitting was at Imphal. The Indian Airlines, the
National Airports Authority, the ATC Guild, the ICPA, the Air
Passengers Association, the Aircraft Maintenance Engineers Asso-
ciation along with one Mr. Kapat being a social worker did partici-
pate at the hearing. In toll 27 witnesses were examined in detail
on various aspects including the training of pilots, co-pilots and
the ATCOs. The last of such hearing did take place on 7th March,
1992. It is to be noted that the sitting at Imphal was necessitated
by reason of the fact that the local people would have an opportu-
nity to express their views in the matter as otherwise it would not
have been possible for them to do so at the Headquarters of the
Court at Calcutta. As a matter of fact, one Mr. Irengbam Boyai-
singh came up before the Court and stated that from the news-
paper report he came to know that the pilot of the ill-fated aircraft
wanted to have an emergency landing but the ATCO did not permit
111111 to land and asked him to wait for ten or fifteen minutes. This
confusion, however, had to be cleared since there was no permis-
sion sought for by the aircraft, neither any emergency existed and
in that view of the matter, this Court made over a copy of the CVR
transcript to him and asked him to appear before the Court after
the luncheon recess. Apparently he was satisfied that there was
no such emergency existed since he did not come back after the
recess. It is also to be noted that on his prayer that the belongings
of his father, being a victim of the crash, which were lying at the
Police Station and the Deputy Commissioner of the Police of the
area was directed to release the same within 24 hours from the
date of the order.
Subsequently, however, at the request of the Government, I
did visit Sydney in Australia and Singapore for the purpose of
undertaking a study as regards the training standards in these two
countries with a view to upgrade the training in India, if it is so
required. It is to be noted that I left the country in the evening of
10th April, 1992 by Air India flight from Calcutta and upon
completion of the study as requested, arrived at Calcutta in the
afternoon of 19th April, 1992, instead of 22nd April, 1992, as
scheduled earlier.

13. ANALYSIS OF EVIDENCE TENDERED BEFORE THE
COURT OF INQUIRY:
The evidence tendered before the Court of Inquiry for the
purpose of correct appreciation may be sub-divided, under the
following heads : -
i) Possibility of sabotage;
ii) Airworthiness of the aircraft;
ill)(cid:9) Calearance to direct outbound approach;
iv)(cid:9)
Flight path followed by the ill-fated aircraft vis-a-vis
the operational flight plan and the ILS let down chart;
v) Role of co-pilot during the flight.
vi) Possibility of wrong indication by yOR;
vii) GPWS warning and crew response.
It will be convenient to deal with the above seriatim:
i)(cid:9) Possibility of Sabotage:
The Indian Airlines Boeing-737 (VT-EFL) while on a sched-
uled flight on route Calcutta-Imphal-Dimapur being flight No.IC-
257 crashed near Imphal Airport into the hill slopes of Thangjing
Hill with its nose hitting a place approximately 300 feet below the
summit of the hill. Major C.B. Lal, Controller of Explosives,
Bureau of Civil Aviation Security, Calcutta Airport, visited the
crash site for an on-the-spot visual inspection and examination of
the wreckage on 17th and 18th August, 1991 for the purpose of
ascertainment of the factum of there being any sabotage. It is the
definite evidence of Major Lal that he has not seen any positive
signature of explosives or explosion in the aircraft on the wreckage
examination. Major Lal pointed out that if there was a bomb
planted on the aircraft and an explosion resulting therefrom, there
would have been definite signatures on the metal as well as in the
various wreckages of the aircraft and on the dead bodies. In his
evidence he has explained the positive signatures as (a) the forma-
tion of distinctive surface effects such as pitting or very small
100

craters formed in metal surface caused by extremely high velocity
input from small particles of explosives and such craters would
have raised or have rolled over edges and often have explosive
residue in the bottom of the craters; (b) the surface effects would
have shown metal fragments produced by explosives and would
have caused deformation mechanism which are peculiar to high
rate of strain at normal temperature together with a dislocation
movement: because the process in an explosion is thermally acti-
vated at a very high rate of strain. Major Lal explained that in
some metals such as copper, iron and steel deformation in the
crystal of the metals takes place by twinning, that is to say, the
parallel lines or cracks cutting across the crystal. He went on to
say I hat such phenomenon can only Occur if the specimen or the
subject has been subjected to extreme shock wave leading at veloc-
ity in the order of 8,000 metres per second.
On a pointed question from the Court as to whether the
wreckage, as it is in the. matter under investigation, can have the
same affectation in the event of an object hitting the aircraft from
ground, to wit, a missile, the answer of Major LW, however, was in
the negative, since it will create a perforation and then as usual
the explosive blast would be there. Major Lal observed that in that
event, there are also chances of pieces of missile overhead portion
being available at the wreckage site and as such an external object
being thrown and hitting the aircraft cannot but be ruled out and
so is the sabotage by means of a bomb being planted oft board the
aircraft. The report of Major Lal depicts that on examination of
wreckage, centre of explosion and explosion pressure profile could
not be determined as damage to the aircraft's one wing, nose,
cockpit and passenger cabin was total and similar as in the case of
resultant impact of high speed aircraft. The phenomenon of
fragmentation, curling/ringlet effects and spike tooth fractures in
metal surface were also not observed on visual examination. The
phenomenon of cupping dishing of Metal surface, high velocity
penetration of fragments in interior furniture, cushion and plastic
fitments due to explosion were not observed. Major Lal reported
101

that in the light of visual inspection of the crash site and examina-
tion of wreckage in-situ, the theory of mid-air bomb explosion imd
sabotage is rejected. • For convenience sake, however, the report of
Major Lal on the issue of sabotage is annexed hereto and marked
with letter 'J' (the photographs and charts though enclosed with
the report and exhibited before the Court of Inquiry are, however,
not included in annexure *X to avoid the bulk).
ii)(cid:9)
Airworthiness of the Aircraft :
As noted above under the head Aircraft Information, this
particular aircraft VT-EFL was delivered to Indian Airlines on 3rd
December, 1977. The Certificate of Airworthiness was last re-
newed on 26th November, 1990 and was valid upto 27th Novem-
ber, 1991. The aircraft as per the available evidence on record,
both documentary and oral, Was maintained on (lie basis of ap-
proved maintenance schedules and all mandatory modifications
and inspections stipulated by the Directorate General of Civil Avia-
tion have duly been carried out. Mr. D.K. Roy being the Deputy
Engineering Manager, Indian Airlines, Calcutta, has stated that
this particular aircraft was duly checked by the Engineering
Department in all its schedules and he was personally involved in
regard thereto. The Check 'B' Inspection Schedule was carried out
on the night of 15th August, 1991, ending in the morning hours of
16th August, 1991. The document pertaining to the Check 'B'
schedule has duly been signed by five different persons in the
Engineering Division of Indian Airlines. Mr. Roy has further stated
that as a matter of fact the aircraft had come on the day before
from Delhi to Calcutta via Lucknow, Patna and Ranchi and then it
had done the flight in the route Calcutta to Hyderabad via Bhuba-
neswar and back before the Check 'B' Schedule was carried out. It
is not out of place to record that the Check 'B' schedule includes
inspection of electrical and other navigational aids of the aircraft.
Mr. Roy has further stated that usual pre
-
departure check was
also carried out prior to the departure of this aircraft from Calcutta
for Imphal and Dimapur. No snag was reported on the earlier day
102

when the aircraft was in Hight either from Delhi to Calcutta as
above or from Calcutta to Ilyderabad and back excepling I (cid:9) the
ANJ (Auxiliary Power Unit) generator was nonitinelioning. The
APU snag, however, was allowed to continue even after the Check
'B' inspection as by reason of the non-availability of spares at
Calcutta, the unit could not be rectified, but the aircraft was certi-
fied to be fit to undertake the flight by reason of the fact that APU
is one of the MEL items which permits the operator to carry for-
ward the snag upto a period of 72 hours.
While it is true and as appears from the evidence that there
will be no compromise with the safety of the aircraft in the event of
the APU generator being unserviceable, but 11 does not bespeak of
proper administration on the part of the operator, more so when
Calcutta is a major air base for I3ocing 737 airerafts Willi all Ihe
major inspections upto Check-I level arc being carried out at
Calcutta. It is to be noted further ill this context that all checks
upto 1,500 hours of the Boeing 737 aircraft are done at Calcutta
and beyond that the checks are always being carried out at Delhi
and as such spares ought to be made available at Calcutta as
otherwise there is likelihood of such snags being carried forward
probably upto its last limit, namely, 72 hours which cannot by any
stretch be said to be an encouraging state of affairs.
From the available records, it appears that this particular
aircraft VT-EFL was not involved in any major incident necessitat-
ing any major structural repair.
Needless to record here however, that during the Ilight no
emergency was transmitted by the ilight crew at any point of time
prior to the crash. The CVIZ recordings also show that there was
no antra-cockpit conversation indicating any aircraft snag during
the flight. The report of the Controller of Explosives, Calcutta
Airport, indicates that the entire wreckage of the aircraft was locat-
ed within a small area thereby depicting that there was no inflight
structural failure as otherwise it would have resulted in a much
103

wider scatter of the wreckage. It is also pertinent to note that the
FDR data does not show any abrupt change in aircraft flight
parameters and the data indicates that it was a fully controlled
flight till the time of impact.
On the basis of the above discussions, it can thus be safely
concluded that the aircraft (VT-EFL) operating flight IC-257 (Cal-
cutta-hnphal route) was fully airworthy prior to its departure from
Calcutta and during the course of entire flight until the time of
impact.
While it is true that the aircraft was otherwise safe and
secure for undertaking the flight, but I will be failing in my duty if I
do not record certain observations of mine in regard to the mainte-
nance facility at the Calcutta Airport as also in regard to the MEL
items.
The existing facility at Calcutta Airport for undertaking
maintenance work though cannot be said to be lacking in any way
amenity-wise but discussions with the engineers and technicians
reveal that slightly better facility may be made available specially
during the night time. The availability of spares at Calcutta air-
port, however, need also to be augmented.
Coming back on to the MEL item in slightly more greater
detail, it is seen that the manufacturers of the aircraft has itself
provided for carrying forward of certain snags, the list of which
appears from the manufacturers Masters Minimum Equipment
List. The Director General of Civil Aviation, however, upon consid-
eration of the Indian situation modified the list by providing lesser
number of items in the MEL so as to conform to the Indian condi-
tions, considering the total safety aspects of the flight.
Another redeeming feature came to light during the course of
investigation to the effect that while it is true that no snag is al-
lowed to continue from the major base after the night halt, but if
104

the snag is detected one hour prior to the departure and the snag
being one of the MEL items, the aircraft. can be cleared with the
snag carried Ibrward. The operator seems to be quite content with
this sort of practice but in my view the sooner it is dispensed with
the better for safety sake since there is likelihood or at least the
possibility cannot be ruled out. that this detection at the late stage
may be a deliberate one.
ill)(cid:9) Clearance to Direct Outbound Approach :
The most controversial issue in this inquiry is in regard to
grant of permission by Air Traffic Control to go directly outbound
on the basis of a request from the pilot for setting course directly
outbound for let down.
In order to appreciate and to deal with the matter in its
proper perspective, the approach briefing by Pilot-in-Command to
the Co-pilot for convenience sake ought to be noted. The CVR
transcript for approach briefing reads as follows :-
07:01:59 P1(cid:9) P2(cid:9) Visual - - or otherwise we will go
overhead 10,000 feet then on the
hold cleared to 8,000 feet and 070
this will be tear drop entry inbound
217 after that leaving VOR 217 8000
to 5000 feel check !kilo Iwo and half
minute and then in descending turn
to 4200 and then further descend
On interception glide slope only
correction 5,000 feet then a proce-
dure turn after that further inter-
ception with glide slope descending
to decision height 224. Then in case
of missed approach climb straight
ahead to 4200 feet then turn left to
join VOR holding climbing 8,000
feet.
105

Before proceeding further, however, it is to be noted that as
per the flight plan and the let down chart, the aircraft is to come
overhead VOR from South-Westerly direction at a heading of 070"
and after reaching overhead VOR and upon completion of the
holding pattern there itself should follow a radial of 217° for
outbound leg.
Coming back to the CVR transcription as recorded above
under the head 'Approach Briefing' being an antra-cockpit conver-
sation between the Pilot-in-command and the Co-pilot, it appears
that while descending to flight level 135 and as a matter of fact
much before even the aircraft was abeam Khumbigram, the
Pilot-in-Command decided to make a tear drop entry after coming
overhead VOR at 10,000 feet and the permission sought. and the
subsequent approval granted by the ATCO shall have to be consid-
ered On this background that at no point of time time pilot wanted
to complete the holding pattern overhead VOR but some such
turning which would permit him to avail of radial 217° from 070°.
Four transmissions as appear from the CVR transcript between
07:09:45 to 07:09:59 (UTC) ought to be noted at this juncture
being the basic transmissions in regard to the issue in question.
The transmissions read as follows:-
07.09.45 IC-257 Imphal Now, we are one two miles
inbound at ten thousand
1009.
07.09.53 Imphal IC-257 O.K. maintain report overhead
VOR.
07.09.55 IC-257 Implial Roger Overhead, can we set
course directly outbound for
let down.
07.09.59 Imphal IC-257 Roger, you are cleared.
106

The transmissions above, depict that when the aircraft
reported 12 nautical miles away, the tower told the aircraft to
maintain and report overhead VOR. There cannot be any manner
of doubt that the controller at the tower required the aircraft to
report as and when aircraft reaches overhead VOR. The next
transmission is recorded at 07:09:55 i.e. barely two seconds after
the tower's requirement to report overhead VOR, through which
the Pilot-in-Command sought permission to set course directly
outbound for let down and the tower shortly thereafter granted
such a permission by transmitting "Roger, you are cleared".
Two very senior and experienced pilots of the operator were
examined and both of them in no uncertain terms stated that there
cannot possibly be any scope for avoiding overhead VOR while
landing at hnphal Airport. As a matter of fact, the intra-cockpit
conversation corroborates such statements.
Capt. Mehta in answer to Question No.215 has stated that
the pilot has to go overhead and by direct outbound what lie meant
was, he shall not join the holding pattern and turn right by 30° so
that he can pick up 217° and proceed. Further in answer to Ques-
tion No.216 Capt. Mehta categorically stated that when people ask
for direct outbound, it is just on coining overhead and proceeding
outbound directly but after coining overhead VOR. Incidentally it
is to be noted that on a pointed question from the Court, Capt.
Mehta stated that with 8 octa cloud lie would never ask for a
permission for a direct outbound without joining the holding pat-
tern of overhead VOR.
Capt. Rahut, another very experienced pilot of the operator
also in no uncertain terms stated that even if one wants to come
direct outbound, there is no escape but to come overhead VOR and
then go on radial 217 and direct outbound does not mean that he
will not go overhead VOR (vide Q. 130 to 134).

On a plain reading of the statements, it is, therefore, clear
and apparent that the permission to set course directly outbot►►► cl
obviously mean and in► ply, when overhead and not to set coarse
directly outbound for let down from that point itself. Both Capt.
Mehta and Capt. Rahut have in no uncertain terms stated that
pilot shall have to come overhead VOR in any event. The ATCO
also if under that belief, cannot thus be said to be wrong more so
by reason of the fact that a distance of 12 miles calmot be covered
in Just two seconds. It is an inconceivable idea that a pilot would
commence a let down without getting a ground fix ,namely, over-
head VOR. Further, it is to be noted that the pilot,.in fact, at
07:11:26 UTC transmitted on an enquiry from the Tower about the
position of the aircraft as "We are approaching overhead". It is in
evidence that setting course directly outbound can be affected by
making a loop or a tear drop entry and it is as per (he choice of the
Pilot-in-Command. The Senior Aerodrome Officer Mr. Rastogi has
stated such a tear drop entry is permissible and.as a matter of fact
the pilot among themselves have decided to make a tear drop entry
overhead VOR. Incidentally it is to be noted that at the approach
briefing the pilot has in no uncertain terms stated that visual or
otherwise he will come overhead VOR at 10,000 feet and obtain
radial 217 after a tear drop entry.
Can it thus be stated that the transmission from the Tower
to the pilot in approval .of the request of the pilot to go direct
outbound has really mislead the pilot - in► r► ry view the answer
cannot but be in the negative. The pilot is responsible for safe
landing at the airport - he has to decide what approach he will
make; the ATCO does not have any say in the matter, though
however, some amount of extra care on the part of the ATCO would
undoubtedly have been better. It is the standard procedure that
the pilot shall have to report overhead VOR, as a matter of fact the
ATCO did ask the pilot to report when overhead VOR and the pilot
in turn has acknowledged it by using the expression 'Roger'.
Subsequent transmission approaching overhead from the pilot and
"understand proceeding on a radial 217" ought also to be consid-
108

ered. Radial 217 is the correct flight path which a pilot should
follow - reminding the pilot of his radial even if the pilot. is proceed-
ing direct outbound - in my view ought to have given the pilot
sufficient indication so far as safety is concerned from the ATCO's
point of view. It is for the pilot to manoeuvre the aircraft and
obtain the radial 217 and not for the ATCO to bring him 011 to
radial 217 from overhead VOR - afterall the pilot is incharge of the
aircraft and not the ATCO. Considering the matter from the other
point of view, even one cannot but come to an inescapable conclu-
sion that the pilot understood by such transmission from the
Tower that he shall have to come overhead VOR as otherwise he
would not have transmitted at a subsequent point of time that he
is approaching overhead VOR. This factum of subsequent trans-
mission negates the theory of the pilot being•lnislead by the grant
of permission for direct outbound. It is needless to say that it is a
pilot who has sought permission to go direct outbound and not the
ATCO on his own required the aircraft to go direct outbound. The
ATCO only approved the approach of the pilot which under the
normal circumstances the ATCO permits. Assuming, the pilot
asks for a visual approach since the runway is in sight - would the
ATCO negative such an approach - in the normal circumstances
the answer is in the negative - the reason being the pilot ought to
know what approach to make for safe landing of the aircraft and
this is a standard procedure to grant permission to a visual ap-
proach for landing when such a permission is sought for. The
transmission under consideration is also one such approval on the
pilot's seeking such a permission - moreso, by reason of the fact
that the approach is a pilot-oriented approach and not a radar-
vectored approach wherein the ATCO is the person responsible for
safe vectoring of the aircraft upto final approach for landing.
Turning now on to the other aspect of the matter as to
whether this particular call-out can be termed to be a justifiable
call-out - Capt. Mehta in no uncertain terms stated it to be an
absolutely wrong call-out. Let us now try to analyse the situation
in a slightly more greater detail. The flight plan available to the
109

pilot depicts that he should approach overhead VOR with 070'
heading which mean and imply that the aircraft should be ap-
proaching the VOR from the South-West direction. Having the
heading in mind, it would be a near impossibility to obtain out-
bound radial 217 before outer marker unless, hOwever, the pilot
comes overhead VOR and follows a tear drop turn or joins the VOR
hold for proceeding outbound since the angle of turn would other-
wise be extremely difficult to manoeuvre.
On the basis of the above, it can therefore be safely conclud-
ed that this particular call-out seeking permission to go direct
outbound cannot be termed to be a proper call-out but a wrong
call-out as Capt. Mehta described it. As a matter of tact, (he pilot
wanted to cut short his timings, which has unfortunately placed
him much beyond the safety zone. The details of the pilot's action,
however, would be dealt with hereinbelow.
iv)(cid:9)
Flight Path followed by the ill-fated aircraft vis-a-vis the
Flight Plan and ILS Let Down Chart
:
The operator for all its routes evolved various operational
flight plans detailing out the headings at different points of time for
the entire route and hnphal is no exception. The flight plan for
Calcutta-Irnphal sector categorically states the MORA - 10,000
feet. In ordinary common English parlance MORA - 10,000 feet
mean and imply safe altitude upto 10,000 feet. The elevation of
the airport has also been given at 2,536 feet. The details of flight
plan for Calcutta-Imphal sector would appear from page 5 of this
report; Chapter 2 "The Unfortunate Flight". The flight plan depicts
a total flight time from Calcutta to overhead VOR Imphal to be 52
minutes and a further eight minutes thne has been added to facili-
tate landing at the airport on ILS let down chart from overhead
VOR. Considering the flight plan as above, the entire flight timings
from Calcutta to Imphal is to the extent of 60 minutes. The flight
plan takes care upto overhead VOR Imphal and the let down chart
thereafter guides the pilot to land safely on the airport upon follow-
110

ing the standard ILS procedure as per the let down chart and that
precisely is the reason why the let down chart commences from
overhead VOR at Imphal Airport. There is definite evidence that in
the event the pilot follows the flight plan and the let down chart,
question of there being any hazard or there being any compromise
with safety would not arise.
The FDR data as available from the FDR read-out, indicates
that the Pilot-in-Command of the ill-fated aircraft IC-257, in fact,
followed the flight plan in its entirely upto Comilla and there
exists no deviation whatsoever from the flight plan. The devia-
tions, however, started only after the aircraft crossed over Comil-
la. FDR data records that instead of 007 heading, the aircraft
followed 053, completely by-passing overhead Agartala. The CVR
transcript, however, records a transmission at 06:51:44 LITC as
approaching overhead Alpha Alpha Tango, but as noted above, the
FDR data tell a different story. The aircraft was nowhere near
Alpha Alpha Tango - why this call-out then - obviously to give an
impression that the flight plan is being obeyed in its entirety and
there is no departure therefrom. If the pilot does not give such a
call-out, the same obviously would be noted and he might be put
to books which no pilot desires. Capt. Mehta describes it as a total
indiscipline of the pilot and so does Capt. M.V.V. Rao. It is neither
fair nor reasonable on the part of the pilot of an aircraft to give a
wrong call-out. This is not the end of the story but just the begin-
ning. Question obviously crops up as to how a pilot having fol-
lowed the chart in totality upto a certain point has deviated there-
after - the answer is not very far to seek: From Calcutta to Comil-
la there Is every likelihood of (lie !light path being monitored by the
Radar Controller both. at Calcutta and at Dhaka but beyond that
question of there being any screening of the flight path would not
arise since there is no radar control at Agartala or at Khumbigram
or at Imphal. The pilot, therefore, innovates his own procedure
and a new flight plan cutting corners here and there. I hereby
record my concurrence with the observations of Capt. Mehta that
there is total indiscipline - why on earth a pilot would report
111

overhead Agartala when, in fact, he is nowhere near VOR Agartala
- a grossest possible indiscipline. The FDR data shows that in-
stead of having a heading of 007 the pilot-in-command in fact
proceeded to a heading 053 and continued to do so for a period of
about 12 minutes, when in fact, he was supposed to fly with a
heading of 007 for a period of four minutes and thereafter with a
heading of 070 till such time he conies overhead Imphal. It is to be
noted that after flying about 12 minutes, the pilot changed his
heading to around 81° and continue to fly on the same heading for
a period of about nine minutes and subsequently changed his
heading close to 70°
. But why this departure from the flight plan -
cutting corners with an aircraft is not only unsafe but connotes a
total lack of professional ethics for an airman. Two experienced
pilots and the senior trainer of the operator have deprecated such
an altitude of the pilot and ascribed it to be an act of indiscipline.
Cutting corners is not the only indiscipline noted in the pilot. As
noted above, wrong call-outs is another redeeming feature of this
Particular pilot operating the ill-fated flight. ATCO's enquiry as to
the altitude has also been the victim of such an indiscipline. The
FDR/CVR co-relation note as above, dealt with this aspect of the
matter in detail, suffice it however to record that this attitude of
transmitting wrong altitudes to the ATCO may even result to a
much worst catastrophe had this been happening in a major inter-
national airport where air traffic density is more.
Incidentally it is to be noted that Hight plan ought to be
observed in its observance rather than in its departure therefrom.
I am constrained, however, to record that there was an effort on
the part of the operator to give an impression to the Court that one
can deviate from the flight plan and no exceptiOn can be taken in
regard thereto. Though, however, subsequently on pointed ques-
tions from the Court, the evidence tend to show that it is a ques-
tion of 'must' as regards the observance of the flight plan and it
can only be varied or be deviated from upon special permission
from the Air Traffic Controller and that also is more or less re-
stricted to unusual situations and in the event of visual landing -
112

which is understandable. A pilot experiencing heavy turbulence
and a cb cloud, alien with the permission of the Air Traffic Control-
ler, he might deviate his course but come back to the required
track after avoiding the above eventualities - these are not in the
normal expectations but under unusual circumstances and
nobody can take any exception therefor, but in the normal circum-
stances it is now an admitted state of facts that the pilot should
adhere to the flight plan in its obedience.
The following tabulation indicating the action of the Pilot-in-
Command vis-a-vis the FDR and CVR data will corroborate the
above observations :

On the basis of the above noted tabulation, three main
deviations with respect to flight plan come to light and the same
are being noted hereinbelow for convenience sake :-
As mentioned earlier the total flight time from Calcutta to
overhead Imphal is 52 minutes as per the operational flight plan.
The ill-fated aircraft took-off from Calcutta at 06:24 UTC and
hence was estimated to come overhead Imphal VOR at 0716 UTC.
After the aircraft came in contact with Imphal, it reported at.
06:54:22 hours UTC that it was maintaining flight level 290 and
was estimating overhead Imphal at 07:16. After reaching over-
head Comilla, the aircraft instead of going overhead Agartala,
took almost a direct route to Imphal and it appears that as a result
of this short-cut, the flight crew reported to Imphal ATC at
07:04:48 that its revised estimated time of arrival overhead Imphal
was 07:12 hours UTC indicating thereby that it would reach
Imphal four minutes ahead of the earlier estimated time of arrival.
In accordance with the flight plan, the aircraft is expected to
commence descent about 45 minutes after take off from Calcutta
which in the present case would be 07:09 hours UTC. From the
co-relation of CVR and FDR data, it is observed that the aircraft
had actually commenced descent at 06:59 hours UTC i.e. 10
minutes prior to the expected time of commencement of descent.
Even if the revised ETA is considered, the descent should have
commenced around 0705 hours UTC. No valid reason could be
given under the prevailing circumstances as to why the conunand-
er commenced descent so early - it only reflects disregard to the
laid down operating procedures by the flight crew. It may be
mentioned that in such situation when the crew commences
descent much prior to the time indicated in the flight plan, the
estimated time for the flight would vary on account of change of
true air speed and the commander would not be in a position to
estimate his correct time of arrival at the destination. It is likely
that this may have been a factor that the crew were not knowing
exactly their position while approaching Imphal and gave incorrect
116

position reports. Since on account of early commencement of
descent, true air speed(cid:9) descent would be lower than t he
true air speed taken into account for estimating flight time given in
the flight plan, it is likely that when the crew estimated that they
would be approaching overhead VOR, they were actually much
away from the VOR which may have been a factor for early
commencement of right turn for ILS let down. It is, therefore,
needless to emphasise that such deviations from the flight plan
could cause serious problems during the flight. Incidentally, it is
to be noted that Capt. Bagchi representing the Air Passengers
Association also expressed more or less similar view in his argu-
ments. Capt. Bagchi submitted "The flight as per Operational
Flight. Plan should have commenced descent from F.L. 29() at 0709
or 0705 - revised; which is 1 nit. after abeam Ku. The descent.
permission was given at 06:58:51 approx. 6 nits. earlier, thereby
losing TAS and this actually delayed arrival over Imphal, which
was probably not considered. This miscalculation made the flight
to turn right for outbound earlier". It is, however, clarified that
descent clearance may be given by the ATCO at an earlier point of
time but actual commencement of the descent is dependent-upon
the pilot and the ATCO has no say in regard thereto. In any event
in the matter under consideration the descent clearance was given
to the aircraft by the ATCO at the request of the flight crew (NOTE
- Instead of Silchar it should be read as Imphal in the CVR tran-
script at 06:58:34).
Another deviation which was observed from the Cockpit
Voice Recorder transcript was that at 07:08:44 hours UTC, the
Pilot-in-Command had informed the Co-pilot that they were 25
miles from Imphal at that time, which was perhaps on the basis of
some ground features. At 07:09:45 hours UTC i.e. about one
minute and one second thereafter, the crew reported to ATC
Imphal that they were 12 miles inbound. The above information
tend to indicate as if the aircraft had covered a distance of 13 miles
in about one minute which is an impossibility. The position report
at 07:09:45 was perhaps given on the basis of revised ETA of 07:12
117

which got effected on account of early conuiiencement of descent
and which does not seem to have been taken into account by the
flight crew.
The above deviations in the actual flight path followed by the
aircraft from the laid down operational flight plan reflect scant
respect for laid down operating procedures by the flight crew and
evidently lead to unsafe situations during flight. It also shows that
the crew did not know exact position of the aircraft during ap-
proach to Imphal primarily on account of deviations from the flight
plan. This is evident from the fact that at 07:11:29 the flight crew
reported that they were approaching overhead Imphal VOR where-
as they were actually at that time about 15 nautical miles away
from the VOR. Based on their estimated time of arrival of 07:12,
which was very much at variance with actual position, the flight
crew commenced right turn for direct outbound at 07:11:42 when,
in fact, they were still about 14 nautical miles away from the VOR.
At 07:12:13 hours UTC,the flight crew reported that they were on
outbound leg for let down and were descending to 5,000 feet. At
that time, the aircraft was still about 10 nautical miles away from
the VOR. From the above it is abundantly clear that the crew had
no precise idea about their position and coupled with the fact that
they did not report overhead VOR, they went far away from the
normal ILS path during the let down.
The actual path followed by the aircraft during its approach
to Imphal vis-a-vis the ILS let down path may be seen in Annexure
'K'.
In accordance with the ILS let down chart of Imphal Airport,
the aircraft is required to descend from 10,000 feet to 8,000 feet in
the holding area and then proceed outbound on radial 217 for a
duration of two and half minutes from overhead VOR. The air-
craft's speed during the outbound leg is restricted to a maximum
of 170 knots. In the process of going outbound when the aircraft
flies over middle marker and outer marker, it gets audio and visual
118

signals in the cockpit. During the outbound leg the aircraft
should descend from 8,000 feet to 5,000 feet. As mentioned earlier
the aircraft did not report overhead VOR and, in fact, commenced
right turn when it was about 14 nautical miles away from the VOR
and at an altitude of 10,000 feet. While executing turn, the air-
craft started descent. On completion of the right turn at about
07:13:06 UTC, the aircraft flew in a direction of 196 to 210° for
about 1 minute 35 seconds i.e. upto 07:14:41 UTC and during this
period the aircraft descended to an altitude of about 6,880 feet.
Thereafter, the aircraft turned left in the form of procedure turn.
From the above it is seen that the outbound leg was totally
at variance from the normal outbound leg of an ILS procedure.
The aircraft was nowhere on radial of 217, it never came overhead
middle marker or outer marker which is apparent from the ground
path shown in Annexurc 'K' vis-a-vis the ILS path. This fact is also
borne out from the CVR transcript which shows that there was no
audio signal of middle marker or outer marker recorded on the
tape during the outbound leg. The ill-fated aircraft went on the
outbound leg for about one minute and thirty-five seconds as
against two and a half minutes normally required. The aircraft
speed during the outbound leg was between 175 to 180 knots,
which was higher than the maximum permissible speed of 170
knots. During the outbound leg the aircraft descended to Dui alti-
tude of 6,880 feet whereas as per the ILS let down chart it should
descend to an altitude of 5,000 feet prior to commencement of
procedure turn.
From the CVR tape transcript it is noted that at 07:14:38
UTC there is an antra-cockpit conversation "Two minutes up"
indicating as if the crew were timing the outbound leg mid at that
juncture it had flown for two minutes on the outbound leg though
in fact it had flown only one minute and 35 seconds as noted
above. Admittedly the aircraft did not come overhead VOR from
which the time calculation would have to be made as per the let
down chart for a period of two and a half minutes. There is no
119

evidence on record neither any one of the parties have tried to give
any explanation as to the fix from which the Hine calculation as
appears from the CVR transcript was effected. Obviously, the
pilots were proceeding on the basis of some fix and upon the expiry
of the two minutes have recorded the same as noted above. Capt.
Mehta has stated that a pilot in the event of malfunctioning of the
VOR instrument would always check through other cockpit panel
instruments and as such the possibility of wrong VOR instrument
indication having misled the pilot does not arise. The only pre-
sumption is that the pilots well knew that they are not following
the or adhering to the route chart and in that event probably with
some ground fix they have started calculating the time. It is,
however, to be noted here that the let down chart in fact, provides
for a flight. of two and a half minutes on the outbound leg but on
the basis of the MR read-out there is no manner of doubt that the
pilots were taking a turn immediately after the intra-cockpit con-
versation - two minutes up. This curtailment of time corroborates
the presumption that the pilot well knew that they are not follow-
ing the procedure in terms of the ILS let down chart and as such
there is no manner of doubt that turning short of VOR on to the
right hand side is a deliberate act on the part of the pilot and not
by reason of any misleading information as otherwise they would
not have even. curtailed the two and a half minutes leg to one
minute thirty five seconds only and they obviously came to the
conclusion that this curtailment of nearly a minute leg on the out-
bound would bring him exactly on the saute position where he is
supposed to take the procedure turn in terms of the let clown
procedure and be able to capture the localiser and glide slope and
other ground aids thereafter for landing. This particular attempt,
however, on the part of the pilot cannot said to be justified at all
since according to Capt. Mehta if a pilot goes directly outbound
without reporting overhead VOR, he cannot maintain the correct
reference of time from VOR.
It may also be mentioned that at 07:14:39 ATCO had asked
the aircraft to intimate its altitude at that time, to which the air-
120

craft first reported 5,000, 5,900 feet and then on a subsequent
query from the MVO confirmed 5,000 feet. This was evidently noi
the correct altitude of the aircraft at that time but the crew per-
haps reported this altitude as they were expected to be at 5,000
altitude at the end of the outbound leg. •
A question arises why the flight crew deviated so much from
the laid down ILS let down procedure. The only possible explana-
tion could be that since the aircraft did not come overhead VOR, it
had no reference with which it could measure the time of outbound
leg, fly on the outbound radial of 217 and getting the outer marker
and middle marker signals. Since he did not lose the required
2,000 feet over VOR and did not ily for two and a half minutes on
the outbound leg, he was unable to descend to an altitude of 5,000
feet at the end of the outbound leg.
It is also relevant to note that the ATCO had asked the air-
craft at 07:11:37 UTC and also at 07:12:19 UTC to give a call while
commencing procedure turn. When the ATCO again asked the
aircraft at 07:14:48 to give a call commencingprocedure turn, it
immediately reported that it was in the procedure turn. The FDR
data shows that they had just commenced the procedure turn at
that time though at a wrong position.
While carrying out ILS let down the aircraft is expected to go
to a
11laXi1411111 distance of about 13 nautical wiles front VOlt. The
Meteorological Department of India has inlbrined that on the day of
the accident, the upper wind at 10,000 feet altitude at Imphal was
about 10 knots in a direction from 120°
which is almost a cross
wind and would not alter the aircraft position with respect to VOR,
during the outbound leg or in the procedure turn. It is, however,
to be noted here that the aircraft when it cominenced its procedure
turn, was at a distance of about 17 nautical miles from VOR and
during the course of the procedure turn it went to a distance of
about 20.5 nautical miles from VOR where it impacted with the
hill. Obviously the aircraft was at a position where it should not
121

have been if the laid down ILS procedure was followed. The main
reason as to why the aircraft went out so much away from► VOR, is
that it did not go overhead VOR and commenced right turn for
direct outbound nearly 14 miles away from the VOR and thereafter
it could not adhere to the ILS procedure in any manner. As the
aircraft was executing procedure turn much away from its normal
position, the normal terrains clearance was not available in that
area resulting in direct impact with the hill. The weather prevail-
ing at that time in that region was cloudy and it is most likely that
the crew could not have seen the hill ahead prior to impact as
there is no antra-cockpit conversation indicating any anxiety or
emergency during the last phase of the flight. The GPWS warning
came 'ON' about six seconds prior to the impact. when the aircraft
came over the hilly terrain and one of the conditions for triggering
GPWS warning, namely, excessive terrain closer rate was met. The
CVR transcript and the FOR data do not indicate that (lie flight
crew reacted immediately to the GPWS warning though however,
there was a. gain of about 40 feet in the aircraft altitude hi the final
few seconds indicating that perhaps the crew had initiated go
around action. The terrain avoidance study carried out at Boeing
facilities and the simulator exercises carried out at CTE Hydera-
bad, however, showed that even if the crew had reacted immediate-
ly to the GPWS warning it was not possible for the aircraft to clear
the hill ahead. It is however to be noted that the GPWS is not
designed to provide a timely warning while approaching a steep
hill.
At. Imphal whilst the open Court hearing was taking place,
one Mr. Irengbam Boyaisingh being the son of one Irengbam
Tomboksingh, a passenger who unfortunately died in the crash
has stated before the Court that the Tower Control has not given
any permission to land to the ill-fated aircraft in spite of the fact
that the aircraft wanted such a permission for emergency landing
and as a matter of fact the Tower asked the ill-fated aircraft to wait
for 10 or 15 minutes. This bit of information Mr. Irengbam Boyai-
singh has obtained from the local newspapers and articles and as
122

such a, doubt has crept in as to whether, in fact, there was any
delayed clearance of the aircraft by the Control Tower at. Imphal
which has as a matter of fact extended the outbound leg while
carrying out ILS approach. From the CVR transcript it is very clear
that at no stage the Air Traffic Controller had asked the aircraft to
delay landing nor the commander had sought permission from ATC
for landing or any emergency landing. Therefore, the question of
ATC delaying the permission to land does not arise neither there
was any extension of the outbound leg of the aircraft by reason of
delayed permission.
In the premises it can thus safely be concluded that the Pilot
has not. only deviated from the flight plan but also not lbllowed the
ILS let down chart. In order, however, to ascertain as to whether,
in fact, this is a singular instance or a regular feature with this
particular pilot, this Court directed the Indian Airlines to provide
the FIR spools of four earlier flights undertaken by Capt. Haider
as the Pilot-in-Command for Calcutta/Imphal route. In pursuance
of the above direction, the Indian Airlines did, in fact, provide the
Court with the spools and on an examination of the same it ap-
pears that the pilot has, in fact, more or less followed the self-same
track as has been followed in the instant flight under investigation.
It was suggested by both the Indian Airlines as also by the ICPA
that on all four occasions the approach was VFR and not a IFR one
and as such question of following the same route in a weather
condition as of 16th August, 1991, does not arise. I am, however,
unable to accept such a contention since there is no evidence on
record that thee concerned pilot had sought. permission for a WIZ
approach. The four ilight paths indicate more or less the identical
situation viz. avoiding overhead Agartala and taking more or less a
direct route to Imphal with more or less again the same right turn
and then land without coming overhead VOR. It is in evidence by
two very experienced pilots as noted above that whether the flight
is VFR or IFR, the pilot shall have to come overhead VOR before
approaching the runway to land and as a matter of fact the CVR
transcript of the ill-fated flight also record at 07:01:59 "Visual or
123

otherwise we will go overhead 10,000 feet then on the hold clear to
8,000 feet and 070 this will be tear drop entry inbound 217 after
that leaving VOR 217 ....". In none of these four cases as also in
the instant flight under investigation, the pilot, in fact, has gone
overheadNOR Imphal. Capt. Mehta considering the four FDRs
and flight' data in question of the ill-fated aircraft on 16th August,
1991, has categorically stated that Capt. Haider had been deviat-
ing from the laid down procedure and his pattern is almost the
same and as a matter of fact he has not carried out the procedure
of getting into Imphal. Capt. Mehta further stated that as a pilot
they are supposed to follow the pattern which is laid down and for
which the pilots are briefed and the route charts are also with
them but unfortunately there is no system of knowing the route
followed by a particular pilot unless there is a report and without
an FDR scrutiny it is not possible to know or ascertain as to the
[light path followed by the pilot. It. is to be noted also in this
context that during the tenure of Capt. Mehta as the Operations
Manager, no report has come to him to the effect that the pilot has
not followed the route or there is any abnormality in the arrival
procedure or exit procedure.
While it is true that both. Capt. Mehta and Capt. Rahut in no
uncertain terms have stated that the pilot shall have to come
overhead VOR for Imphal airport but I am inclined to accept the
view of my assessor Shri P. Ashoka that direct visual approach can
be permitted in the event of there being favourable weather condi-
tion and the runway and the approach path can be sighted with
ease provided however, the pilot obtains prior clearance from ATC
by reporting runway in sight.
v)(cid:9) Role of Co-pilot during the flight :
With the advancement of aviation technology and introduc-
tion of fly-by-wire control system, the role of Co-pilots has become
increasingly important in the present age. Co-pilot is not sup-
posed to be a mere passive and mute spectator in the cockpit but
has a definite role to play in the matter of safe flying of the aircraft.
124

The training programme of the operator (Indian Airlines) also
recognises such importance and by reason whereior co-pilots are
trained in the same IIlallnet as the Pilot-hi-Command. C.!apt. M.V.V
Rao being the Operations Manager, Training, at CTE, Hyderabad,
in no uncertain terms stated that the co-pilot should be able to
meet all emergencies - the difference however being between the
Pilot andlthe Co-pilot is that while the former will be more profi-
cient the latter by reason of his lesser experience, may not be that
proficient.
Capt. M.V.V. RaO has also stated that it is one of the primary
duties o the Co-pilot to give corrective advice to his Pilot-in-
1'
Commani and in the event of his failure to give such corrective
advice, 11 r . efficiency cannot but be doubted. Capt. Rao has gone
on furth to state that if the Pilot-in-Command makes a mistake,
it should riot go unnoticed by his Co-pilot and as a matter of tact
both the .ilot and co-pilot should work as a team so that there is
no safety hazard. It is the definite evidence of Capt. Rao that in
the event of deviations by the Captain, the co-pilot should caution
him and ure to administer such caution can be termed to be an
act of indiscipline and if it comes to light, steps would be taken
1
against tie concerned Co-pilot. It is also the duty of the Co-pilot to
inform O.* management in the event of his experiencing any devia-
tions on the part of the Pilot-in-Command and as a matter of fact
there are some such instances, since Co-pilot is always aware of
the actions of the Pilot-in-Command during the course of the flight.
Incidentally it is to be noted that in the instant investigation,
a perusal. of Cockpit Voice Recorder transmission does not show
any word of caution or any correction to the deviations of the Pilot-
in-Conunimd by the Co-pilot. As a matter of fact, the Co-pilot was
as mucha party to the deviations as the Pilot-in-Command -
admittedly the flight crew were working as a team and both of
them were, therefore, deviating from the normal procedure as
depicted in the operational flight plan as also the ILS let clown
chart. Equal indiscipline and lack of professionalism, therefore,
can be ascribed so far as the Co-pilot is also concerned.
125

It is not out of place to record that the Operations Manual of
Indian Airlines provide that the Co-pilot should monitor the in-
strument approach and it is especially important that the Co-pilot
will automatically inform the Pilot-in-Conunand of any abnormal
deviations from the approach procedure, altitude, rate of descent,
speed and timings. As a matter of fact, the Operations Manual
provides that Co-pilot during the approach acts as a safety pilot
and ought not to hesitate to inform the Pilot-in-Command of any
abnormality or procedural discrepancy.
Considering the flight in question (IC-257), the deviations
right after Comilla continued till upto the crash point - not re-
porting overhead VOR Agartala and following an unspecified route
from overhead Comilla, starting of the descent too early contrary
to the operational flight plan; not reporting overhead VOR Imphal;
turning right much short of VOR at Imphal; wrong altitude call-
outs at different locations, have all been accepted by the Co-pilot
without any caution or even an advice. This indicates that the Co-
pilot did not perform his duty as was expected of him. in terms of
the Operations Manual of Indian Airlines.
vi)(cid:9) Possibility of wrong Indication by VOR
During the course of investigation of this accident and at the
open hearings the operator raised doubt in regard to the mal-
functioning of the VOR being one of the navigational aid at the
Imphal Airport. It was submitted that the Pilot-in-Command has
initiated a right turn before coining overhead VOR, may be by
reason of a false indication of (lie VOR. Capt. Willa, however, in
no uncertain terms has negatived that suggestion. In this context,
particular reference may be had to question No.194 and its answer
given by Capt. Mehta. The question as above together with the
answer is set out hereinbelow
"9.194 :(cid:9) So, if you get a false indication on your VOR that can
easily be checked with the help of other available
126

instrument on the cockpit itself? / Yes, cockpit has no
problem lo different late false signals".
Capt. Melita clarified that mal-functioning of VOR can easily
be checked in reference to other front panel instruments. He
stated that it is a standard procedure that as soon as the flag
comes in view on the instrument, the pilots check it with other
instruments. He stated that question of being misguided by
reason of false VOR indication does not and cannot arise. Fur-
thermore, in the normal course of events, in the event of any diffi-
culty being experienced by the pilot by reason of mal-functioning of
anyone of the cockpit instruments including VOR, there would
have been some discussions amongst the pilots and also a subse-
quent transmission in regard thereto to the Air Traffic controller.
On a perusal of the CVR transcript, no such inconvenience has
been discussed or transmitted to the ATCO. In line, therefore, it
can safely be concluded that question of there being any mal-func-
tioning of any panel instruments which could have mislead the
Pilot-in-Command does not and cannot arise.
Incidentally it is to be noted that on the fateful day two other
flights of Indian Airlines, namely, IC-890 from Delhi to Imphal was
operated by an Airbus A-320 aircraft and IC-255 from Calcutta to
Imphal operated by a Boeing 737 aircraft did, in fact, use all the
ground aids without any inconvenience whatsoever. The Com-
mander of IC-255 (Capt. K. Patel) in his statement dated 22nd
August, 1991, stated that all the navigational aids at Imphal were
serviceable and were working normally. Capt. L.P. Mislira, who
operated the flight IC-890 has also confirmed such a state of af-
fairs in regard to the navigational aids at Imphal Airport.
It is to be further noted that the VOR was calibrated by the
National Airports Authority aircraft by carrying out flight tests on
4th June, 1991 and its operational status was declared unrestrict-
ed. Immediately after the accident, the Director General of Civil
Aviation ordered special flight check of the VOR and other ground
127

aids, in pursuance whereof the ground aids at Imphal were cali-
brated on 18111 August, 1991, with a DG('A 1(1)1 esentat lye for I he
purpose of ascertaining as to whether the facilities at Imphal were
in normal working condition. The flight test ensured that all
parameters of VOR were within the specified limits. In this con-
text, reference may be made to Annexure 'G' to this report wherein
it has been stated - "All parameters have been found to be within
defined limits. VOR let down procedure checked and found that
the indications were satisfactory and flyable".
Scrutiny of the maintenance records of Imphal VOR indicat-
ed that maintenance personnel have been taking periodic meter
readings of the VOR equipment as well as undertaking monthly
ground checks. The last fault as recorded in the Fault Log Book of
the VOR occurred on 9th June, 1991, which was attended to and
rectified on the self same day. Thereafter, no fault has been re-
corded for this particular facility (VOR) at Imphal Airport.
In the premises, in my view, it can safely be concluded that
question of there being any false indication of VOR does not arise
neither there is any scope for the pilot being misled by reason of a
false indication.
vii) GPWS warning and Crew action :
CVR recordings have shown that GPWS warning had trig-
gered about six seconds prior to the impact of the 'aircraft with the
11111. The FDR Data indicates that the aircraft was descending till
the time GPWS warning had come ON and thereafter the aircraft
almost levelled off and it had started gaining height thereafter
indicating as if the Commander had initiated action to climb up.
The evidence available shows that the aircraft impacted the
hill at an altitude of about 5200 feet and the maximum height of
the hill at the point of impact is about 5500 feet indicating thereby
that the aircraft impacted about 300 feet below the peak of the hill.
128

A question arose whether the aircraft could have cleared the
hill if action was initiated by the Pilot to 'Go-around' immediately
when the GPWS warning had come 'ON'. In order to examine this
aspect, simulator flights were carried out on B-737 simulator of
Indian Airlines at CTE Hyderabad using the CVR and FDR Data.
During the simulator flights the aircraft speed was maintained
around 180 kts. which was the speed at which the aircraft had
impacted. Since the aircraft was turning at an average rate of
about 3 degrees per second during the period when GPWS warning
was 'ON', corresponding 30 degree aircraft bank was maintained
during the simulator flight. As per the CVR read out the crew had
taken the Flaps to position 1. During the procedure (turn► generally
Flaps are at position 5. The simulator flights were, therefore,
carried out for both Flap 1 and Flap 5 positions.
The simulator flights were carried out by Capt. DeCosta, a B-
737 Examiner along with Capt. R.I. Singh under the supervision of
Capt. Thergaonker. These flights were conducted in the presence
of the Court, DGCA, Dy. DGCA and Director of Air Safety. From
the simulator flights, it was observed that even if inunediate action
was taken to pull up the aircraft and engine throttles moved
forward immediately when the GPWS warning had come 'ON', the
aircraft could gain a height of 100 to 110 feet with Flaps 1 and
Flaps 5 respectively. It, therefore, indicates that even if the crew
had initiated immediate 'Go-around' when the warning came 'ON'
the aircraft could not have cleared the hill.
Since the issue pertain to the pilot's reaction and has thus a
serious effect on the training aspect, I directed the Deputy Director
General of Civil Aviation, Government of India, to have a simulator
exercise being done at the manufacturers end for terrain avoid-
ance. In accordance therewith, all necessary details were sent to
the manufacturers, and in fact, one Mr. James Kerrigen, an Aero-
nautical Engineer of the Boeing Company from Seattle, Washing-
ton D.C. appeared before the Court of Inquiry as a witness with all
129

necessary evidence including the computerised graph for the
simulator exercise in regard to terrain avoidance. Mr. kerrigen
stated that with a moderate human approach to the signal from
GPWS, the pilot could not have cleared the terrain. Since taking
the pilot's reaction into consideration, the climb rate would be
around 90 feet per second after obtaining full throttle power and to
achieve full throttle power, the aircraft takes about 3.5 seconds. In
answer to a pointed question as to whether the climb rate would be
greater after attainment of climb rate of first 90 feet per second,
Mr. Kerrigen stated that it would be again in the region, of 90 feet
per second though there might be slight variation by reason of flap
position being flap 1 and flap 5, though however, variation would
be extremely negligible. It is to be noted, however, that originally
the simulation at the manufacturers end was carried out on 'Nil
Wind' basis, but at the request of the Court special messages were
sent to the Boeing Company by Mr. Kerrigen for drawing out the
flight path on the basis of 10 and 20 knots of tail wind on the
outbound leg and Mr. kerrigen also produced the fax in regard
thereto, which however, does not show much of a difference in the
ground path by reason of the existence of the tail wind as above.
The study of the Boeing Company is already an annexure to this
report being Annexure 'F'.
Though the aforesaid study indicates that 'Go-round' action
by crew after the warning had come 'ON' would not have prevented
Ilse accident, importance of iminediate crew action whenever GPWS
warning conies 'ON' cannot be over-emphasised. • When the aircraft
is flying in IMC conditions, the crew is not in a position to deter-
mine how close they are with the terrain and hence, immediate
action when GPWS warning comes 'ON' could save collision of
aircraft with terrain. Even when the aircraft is flying in VMC
conditions and crew may see the terrain the warning should not be
ignored since the aircraft may not be in a safe configuration to land
i.e. the Landing Gear may not be extended, flaps may not be in
landing configuration or the deviation from the ILS Glide Path may
be excessive. Even if crew could visually see that there• is no
130

danger of collision with terrain, it is necessary to take immediate
action to check the aircraft configuration whenever (i1)Ws xvarning
conies 'ON'. While Indian Airlines have informed that their trai► ring
procedures require that GPWS warning should not be ignored and
immediate action should be taken, it is absolutely essential that
the drill of taking inunediate action to 'Go-around' in IMC condition
and to check the aircraft configuration in VMC condition should be
rigorously practiced during the training and subsequent refresher /
proficiency training and. checks. The Airline should monitor this
aspect very closely so that crew react to the warning without loss
of time which is very crucial in such situations.

While it is true that the method and mode of training seem
to be rather rigorous and according to Capt. M.V.V. Rao in accord-
ance with other global standard, but I have certain reservations in
regard to the career pattern of pilots in Indian Airlines. It is no-
ticed that young boys are recruited from open market and after
training they operate the flight as Co-pilot (P-2) in B-737 aircraft
from where, however, the same man progresses as Co-pilot on A-
320 aircraft and finally as Co-pilot on A-300 aircraft. Surprisingly,
however, in terms of career pattern followed by Indian Airlines as
regards command endorsement it is only P-2 in A-300 who gets a
command endorsement as P-1 In B-737 and progressively as Pilot-
in-Command in A-320 and thereafter on A-300. This particular
career pattern cannot in my view stand to any reason whatsoever
since from the conventional type (B-737) one is taken to fly-by-wire
glass cockpit as a Co-pilot and thereafter again transmitted to a
conventional aircraft (A-300) and finally transmitted back as Pilot-
in-Command in the conventional B-737 and thereafter from
conventional to glass cockpit and then again to conventional
aircraft. It seems before drawing out this career pattern there was
no strict application of mind so far as the operator (Indian Airlines)
is concerned otherwise there would not have been a shift from
conventional to glass cockpit and from glass cockpit to convention-
al aircraft on more than one occasion in the career of a particular
individual while acting as a Co-pilot and a Pilot-in-Command. In
my considered opinion this cannot be termed to be a very safe
career pattern and if this particular career pattern is continued I
have no hesitation to record that there will be nothing but a
compromise with the safety of air passengers. Time has now come
136

up, therefore, for the operator to restructure the whole career
paiiwi of the pilots so as to be in coniormity with tlw safety norms
as is prevalent throughout the globe. It is to be noted, however,
that A-320 pilots (P-1 or P-2) do not Hy any other aircraft in actu-
ality.
On the basis of available evidence, however, as regards Capt.
Halder's proficiency, I find that his Boeing 737 endorsement train-
ing was first taken up by Capt. M.S. Sharma, but after about 2
hours and 15 minutes of simulator sorties, Capt.. Sharma did not
find Capt. Haider to be suitable enough for undergoing the training
and he discontinued his training thereafter. Capt. M.V.V. Rao
upon proper scrutiny of the records maintained by the Indian
Airlines training institute, has stated that since Capt. Halder was
doing hard landings, Capt. Sharma discontinued his training.
According to Capt. Rao, this discontinuance may be due to
communication gap between the trainee and the instructor or
Capt. Halder's performance being not upto the expected standards,
though however, there is no evidence available on this score and
the statement as above admittedly was purely on guess work of
Capt. Rao. Incidentally it is to be noted that after Capt. Sharma
discontinued with the training, Capt. Rahut was entrusted for
training of Capt. Haider for Boeing endorsement wherein after 15
days Capt. Rahut found him fit for endorsement. It is not out of
context to note here, however, that Capt. Rahut also informed that
during Ills 15 days training, he found Capt. Haider coming high On
approach on turn which he corrected after bye or six landings
including the corrections of the deficiencies reported by Capt.
Sharma.
On the basis of above, it therefore, appears that both Capt.
Sharma and Capt. Rahut found him deficient at the first stages on
two specific counts and as such a•doubt creeps in my mind as to
whether Capt. Haider should have been cleared for Boeing 737
endorsement without being taken up for further training so as to
give him more experience or not. The trainer apparently felt that
137

there is no deficiency in Capt. Haider. It is on this count that I
wish to put oil record that training even as per the procedure
noted above ought to be in strict accordance therewith and there
ought not to be any laxity or any compromise with such a training
to a pilot. It is true that Capt. Sharma did not record that Capt.
Halder needs further experience before obtaining Boeing 737
endorsement, but omission to record the same ought not to be
taken note of as his assent to a new instructor to obtain Boeing
737 endorsement training.
In this perspective, therefore, I would like to record my
observations that in the event of any deficiency being noticed by
the trainer, instead of changing the trainer further experience
ought to be given to the pilot concerned so that when he takes up
the course for endorsement, there cannot be any deficiency in the
pilot concerned. Let it be clarified that I am not trying to impute
any deficiency in Capt. Halder, but the system ought to be such so
as to obviate such deficiencies during the endorsement training
course. This observation of mine is based mainly on the evidence
of Capt. Rao that in the normal course of events one instructor is
attached to one trainee unless the instructor is not available for
continuation of such training.
It is at this juncture that my visit to Australia and Singapoie
seems to be well-worth. The training standards set up by the
operator (Indian Airlines) and the Director General of Civil Aviation
cannot be termed to be different or deficient in any way from that
of the Qantas or Singapore Airlines training programme. As a
matter of fact, the training programme in our country is as rigor-
ous as that of the other two countries but the system of training is
the sphere where we need focus our attention. Qantas Airlines has
evolved a course intituled "Cockpit Resource Management Course"
(CRM). In the introduction to the CRM course, it is stated -
"perhaps the first, and most identifiable element in Cockpit Re-
source Management training is that of using the available re-
sources in decision making. One purpose of the CRM course is to
138

I
overcome a basic weakness that initial training has bred into pi-
lots. Pilots have been taught to Hy aircraft as sole crew members.
CRM will leach us to use all the resources at. our disposal to gather
information, review the information, analyse that information,
develop solutions, implement the decision and evaluate the per-
formance as an ongoing process of education.
Another part of CRM training is understanding conununica-
tion. We will learn how to conununicate with other people effective-
ly. We will learn how other people react to certain styles of
communication. We will learn which styles of communication
produce the best results in specific situations. We will learn about.
communication without speaking. We will learn to listen.
As part of the understanding of conummication, we will learn
about ourselves and how others relate to our style. We will learn
to analyse our own personalities and recognise our own strengths
and weaknesses. We will learn when to be assertive and when to
be supportive and we will learn to recognise and avoid using ag-
gessive behaviour and to see the fine line between the supportive
and the submissive.
We will learn how to properly assess the priorities and
channel the team effort toward eliective accomplishment of the
prime task."
According to Qantas it is not a training department plot to
impose another series of discussion items for licence renewal. The
course will have no examination or tests and the ongoing training
will not involve CRM test, the command prorogative will be main-
tained. The object is to assist the Captain to come to the best
decision and to train his crew to be useful to their captain in this
decision making process. The training is designed to teach them
when to speak, how to speak and if it is absolutely necessary
where not to take 'no' for an answer. The idea is to practice CRM
and then to discuss the collective performance at a debriefing at
139

which the instructor is little more than the master of ceremonies.
To aid in the debriefing, the simulators arc fitted with video cam-
eras and matters of interest will be played back to the crew by the
instructor in the briefing room. The debriefing will consist of the
instructor leading a discussion whereas the crew evaluate their
own performance aided by the video play-backs. This CRM course
consists of various factors, namely, (i) Decision process; (11) Situa-
tional factors affecting decision making; (iii) Behavioural deci-
sions; (iv) Communications attitude; (v) Leadership; (vi) The
team works. This CRM provides a better opportunity and an
understanding of the whole situation which would otherwise be not
available to a flight crew while operating a flight.
Unfortunately, not an iota of evidence is available on record
before this Court of Inquiry in regard to this particular course of
Cockpit Resource Management so far as the Indian Airlines is
concerned. I have, however, learnt that some time back this par-
ticular course was in fact introduced by Indian Airlines, but for
some reason or other the same was abandoned. Having experi-
enced the necessity of such a course in Australia, I have no
manlier of doubt its utility vis-a-vis the safety of air passengers.
The video play-back has a tremendous effect on human psychology
more so when the person viewing it, is a pilot. Nobody need tell
him about the draw-backs, if there be any, since one can realise
his own mistake through observation by himself and the operator
would be well-advised to introduce such a course for the purpose
of an effective cockpit management during the course of a flight.
As regards the Civil Aviation Authority, it is noticed in Aus-
tralia that there is no active participation of the regulatory authori-
ty, but its functions are restricted to supervisory nature since the
entire safety aspect of an air travel is dealt with in an elaborate
fashion by the operator itself and the examples are galore.
As regards the proficiency checks, the CAA Australia re-
quires the pilots to have the same checks twice a year but the
140

operator, namely, the Qantas Airways does the same checks them-
selves four times a year - this by itself depicts the sincerity of the
operator in the matter of sale flying.
As regards the check pilots, it is the operator (Qantas Air-
ways) who nominates the check pilots upon completion of the
check pilots course and the Civil Aviation Authority Australia
grants necessary certification in regard thereto after the nominated
check-pilot is checked by their examiner. The CAA also monitors
the actions of the check pilots and if the latter do not conform to
the flight standards, the check pilot's authority to act as such is
withdrawn forthwith.
As regards the initial training, it appears that the standard
of pilots proficiency is carefully controlled by proper selection at
the initial stage. Qantas early out psychological tests and aptitude
tests for proper coordination and reaction in a given situation. The
ab-initio pilots are selected at an age of 19 years and it is the
Qantas who send them for training to an approved training school
for which a substantial amount of money is to be paid to the train-
ing schools by the Qantas itself for carrying out ab-initio training,
though, however, the remaining cost would be borne by the trainee
himself. The flying training at the training school is completed in a
duration of about 16 months and on completion of which the
trainees acquire Commercial Pilots' Licence. Thereafter, the train-
ee undergoes 8 months training with Qantas on a particular type
of aircraft, thus, in about 2 years time from the start of ab-initio
training, the trainees become second officers. It takes about 5
years approximately to be a first officer from the rank of second
officer and thereafter on the basis of the seniority and on the usual
command training and checks the firSt officer obtains Pilot-in-
Command endorsement. The Flight Operation Standards pilots
about 5 in number, carry out surveillance checks of about one per
cent of the sectors which is about 25 sectors per month. The
surveillance and monitoring is now being gradually delegated by
the Civil Aviation Authority to the airline Flight Operations Stand-
141

ards. The Flight Operations Standards pilots monitor the standard
of individual pilots - they check the check pilots, inspect the
simulators and training institutes and maintain data base of pilots.
As noted above, though the CAA requires that proficiency
checks of pilots be carried out at least twice every year. Qantas
carries out such checks every three months and every pilot goes
through simulator exercise every three months. A report is pre-
pared every time and the assessment is kept in the computer and
retrieved for review whenever the pilot goes for promotional train-
ing or is appointed as a check captain. If during a simulator
check, a pilot fails, he is taken off flying immediately till he passes
the checks. The general trend of the proficiency of the pilots is
4
retrieved from the computer data which may show any deficiency
in the training system if it prevails. Such monitoring reduces the
failure rates and hence saves training costs. The nil accident rate
of Qantas has helped them in reducing the insurance cost and has
improved the passenger confidence as a result of which they get
higher share of passenger traffic. While appointing check pilots,
the computer data of the pilot is scrutinised by the Flight Stand-
ards branch and it is only thereafter a pilot is taken for training as
a check pilot. After successful completion of checks by the Flight
Standards pilots, the name of the pilot is recommended to CAA for
approval.
One of the most important feature of monitoring and surveil-
lance by Qantas is monitoring of Quick Access Recorder (QAR).
They monitor the data of every flight with the help of computer
system and analyse the 50 selected parameters to find out if there
exists any deviation from the limit values. If there is a general
trend of exceedence of any particular parameter the training
division is immediately informed to find out if there is any
deficiency in the training. On implementation of remedial
measures they have been able to drastically reduce the deviation
rates. The QAR analysis has been established with the
concurrence of pilots' Union on the condition that the name of the
142

crew will not be divulged and any deviation observed during the
analysis will be told to the Union for taking necessary measures to
eliminate the same. The Qantas do not take any direct action and
it is left to the Unions. They have found the system working
satisfactorily as according to them the Unions and the individual
pilots are made more responsible to ensure that no deviations from
the laid down procedures occur.
During the training of pilots in the simulator, they make the
video tapes which they show subsequently to the pilots so that
they become aware of any deficiencies during their simulator train-
ing.
Any personality traits of pilots are not allowed to affect air-
line operations. Even if a pilot passes every proficiency test but if
his personality can cause difficulty in airline operations, he is not
given command endorsement and he is kept only as a first officer.
In the introduction chapter of this report, I have already
delved into the role of Executive Pilots in Australia. It is not also
out of place to note that the Executive Pilots arc allowed to fly by
Qantas only about 1 /3rd of the flying done by the line pilots. In
order that these pilots do not suffer financially, they are kept on
fixed salary independent of the hours flown by them. In this way,
a proper balance is maintained. The nannimum flying required to
be done by the executive pilots so as to maintain surveillance and
to have a feel of the operations and also provides enough time to
them to devote on the aspects of planning and monitoring the
training and operational aspects. In this way, the executive pilots
maintain very close watch on day-to-day operations and can. devote
enough time in office to handle the operational matters.
Singapore Airlines is also one of the safest airlines in the
world. There has been no accident to Singapore Airlines during
the last 30 years. The training progranune of Singapore airline is
quite similar to the programmes in India and Australia. The opera-
143

tor prepares the training programme of pilots and submits the
same to CAA for approval. During the training oil simulator, the
aircraft flight path is plotted by computer and if a pilot is found not
reacting urgently in an emergency, the instructor would repeat the
exercise. On operators aircraft, the CAA flight inspectors check the
check-pilots and examiners of Singapore Airlines. The flight in-
spectors carry out checks of the examiners and the check pilots
once in about two months. The airline examiners check the profi-
ciency of pilots and the CAA ensures that the laid down system
works and they only do sample checks.
The airline decides on which type of aircraft a pilot will go for
training and there is no choice of a pilot to decide which aircraft he
would go for training. A CPL holder becomes first officer after
about eight months training with the airline. During the training
lie can go as a second officer and acts as a supernumary pilot.
Before a Co-pilot can become a Pilot-in-Command, he should get
ALTP and acquire about 5,000 hours experience as a Co-pilot.
Thus, a Co-pilot would become a Pilot-in-command after about 10
years.
A pilot can fly only one type of aircraft at a time. Pilots
holding command endorsements on basic B-747-200 or 300 air-
craft cannot fly B-747-400 aircraft. Only check pilots and examin-
ers can fly two types of aircraft. Even cabin crew can fly only on
two types of aircraft.
The simulator training is Imparted by instructors who are
current on the type. Only recurrent training can be given by re-
tired pilots who are appointed on ad hoc basis. Singapore Airlines
requires proficiency checks of pilots on simulator to be done at
every three months.
From the study of the training and proficiency monitoring of
pilots by Qantas and Singapore Airlines, it is noted that the airline
systems are well laid down, followed and monitored. It is the
144

airlines which takes responsibility to ensure compliance of the laid
down procedures. The CAA is there to carry out random checks.
The culture in the airline is so safety conscious that one cannot
think that there would be any deviation from the laid down proce-
dures. The pilots and the associations arc made responsible to
remove deficiencies observed during the monitoring. The airline,
let alone the CAA, does not have to resort to punitive actions to
enforce compliance of the operating procedures. Such a culture
needs to be developed, if we have to take a major step forward
towards the safety of aircraft operations. All concerned whether an
individual pilot, pilots associations, the executive pilots, the
management of the airlines and the regulatory authorities haNT to
re-orient and restructure their policies and programmes to culti-
vate a healthy atmosphere, the spirit of team work and collective
sharing of the responsibilities.
The other aspect of the training to pilots in the matter of
terrain avoidance in our.country ought also to be emphasised. It is
to be noted that the Aviation Research and Education Foundation
of the United States of America recommended to the Federal Avia-
tion Authority in the context of Delayed GPWS Response Syndrome
the following :
emphasize that the only acceptable procedure
for reacting to a GPWS pull-up warning of impending
impact with the ground is to immediately set maxi-
mum thrust and rotate to the pitch angle for maxi-
mum angle of climb;
specify that daylight visual observation is the
only acceptable means for contradicting such a GPWS
pull-up warning for terrain closure;
ensure that the airplane flight manuals and
training curricula of all GPWS equipped U.S airlines
prescribe the aforementioned procedures for dealing
with a terrain-closure GPWS pull-up warning;
require that GPWS equipped U.S. carriers in-
clude a terrain closure GPWS pull-up warning in all
initial and recurrent simulator training sessions;
145

- set a deadline for upgrading all first-generation
GPWS equipment to the current state of the art; and
- ensure that the minimum terrain clearance
standards used by GPWS are compatible with those
used in establishing minimum altitudes for radar
vectors and for approach charts."
Subsequently, however, National Transportation Safety
Board of USA also in the line as above recommended that "FAA
should instruct all air carriers to include in their flightcrew proce-
dures instructions which require an immediate response to the
ground proximity system's terrain closure "pull-up" warning when
proximity to the terrain cannot be verified instantly by visual
observation. The required response to this warning should be that
the maximum available thrust be applied and that. the aircraft be
rotated to achieve the best angle of climb without delay."
After considerable deliberation, the Federal Aviation Admin-
istration, USA, also responded to the need of the hour and imple-
mented the recommendations.
Both in Australia and in Singapore, the pilots are trained to
react immediately with the triggering of the Ground Proximity
Warning System. In Australia, during training of pilots for
command endorsements, random GPWS warning is injected on to
the computer at the simulator and the pilot's reaction is noted by
the computer. Such a reaction thereafter is scrutinised and if
thought fit, further training is imparted on to the pilot in regard
thereto. The importance of adhering to GPWS is made known to
the Pilot-in-Command. Similar is the situation in Singapore.
It is heartening to note also the Director General of Civil
Aviation in his anxiety in regard to this particular branch of Air
Safety issued an Air Safety Circular in January, 1992 to the follow-
ing effect :-
SUBJECT: GROUND PROXIMITY WARNING SYSTEM RESPONSE
In the last two decades, the world over, it has been
noticed that there is a tendency on the part of the pilots
to ignore Ground Proximity Warning resulting in avoid-
able accidents. It has been the cause of worry and
146

concern amongst the Civil Aviation Authorities the
world over. Circulars have been issued by FAA as early
as 1981 in regard to procedures to be followed when a
ground proximity warning is sounded in the cockpit of
the aircraft.
2. Pilots have a tendency to ignore ground proximity
warning, based on their experience of false triggering of
this alarm. When they had responded to the alarm in
other causes, it had been too late. In India also, it has
also been observed in a few cases, that pilots have
ignored Ground Proximity Warning with disastrous
consequences.
3. It is, therefore, hereby ordered that the following
procedures may be followed by all pilots :
i) In regard to terrain closure "pull up" alarm when
the pilot has no accurate visual observation as a
basis for contradicting it, the moment the alarm
is sounded, the pilot may execute corrective action
by immediate application of maximum available
thrust while simultaneously rotating the airplane
to achieve the best angle of climb. The rate of
rotation must be consistent with the existing
fight parameters of the aircraft concerned so as
not to exceed the critical angle of attack.
ii) Pilots should not inhibit GPWS warning system
unless there is positive contra indications by
accurate visual observation.
iii) Air carriers should review their operations
manuals to incorporate appropriate flight crew
training procedures to train pilots for action with
respect to GPWS signals. The airline carriers may
incorporate even in the training programmes
appropriate routines for training, to respond to
GPWS alarm. They should also test the pilots to
such GPWS response during checks, trainings and
other routine exercises which they are required to
carry out in the simulator from time to time.
iv) Airlines may immediately carry out a check of all
the GPWS equipment on the aircraft to ensure
their integrity and proper serviceability to elimi-
nate false alarm.
147

4.(cid:9) Action taken by the Airlines in compliance of this direc-
tive that :
(a) they have brought this circular to the notice of all
their flying crews;
(b) they have incorporated suitable provisions in their
operations manuals; and
(c) they have issued appropriate direction to the
Training Establishments for the training proce-
dures required in this regard.

2. CMD, Vayudoot (Capt. Treitan)
3. Chairman, Air India (Sltri Yogesh Deveshwar)
4. All Air Toxi Operators.
From the records produced before this Court, it appears that
the copy of the Circular was duly sent to all the Civil Aviation
Operators operating hi this country and the operators including
the Indian Airlines did in fact respond to the same confirming
having taken the action in terms therewith. As regards the confir-
mation of Indian Airlines is concerned, the same is quoted herein-
below:
"We confirm having taken the action as under :
(a) The circular has been brought to the notice of living
crew through our Regional Operations Manager.
(b) The circular is being incorporated as Appendix I to
para 8.5.0 page 8.26 of IA Operations Manual Vol.!.
148

(c) Director of Training, CTE, Hyderabad has been advised
for taking suitable action vide our letter No.110P/23-
7863/5232 dated 20th January, 1992."
I am, however, constrained to note here that even though the
Operations Manager (Training), was available in the witness box,
the implementation by the Director of Training in regard to the
circular issued by the Director General of Civil Aviation has not
been placed on record and as matter of fact on a pointed question
from the Court, the Operations Manager simply stated that their
training procedures require that GPWS warning should not be
ignored and immediate action should be taken. While theoretically
this may seem to be otherwise in accordance with the circular, but
there is some amount of difference between the theory and the
actual practical. training course. No evidence whatsoever is avail-
able on record to show the introduction of a curriculum in regard
to the pilot's action on the triggering of the GPWS, neither their
training manual or a syllabus in regard to has been produced
before the Court - this state of affairs cannot be stated to be very
encouraging.
In my view, it is high time that due importance be attached
to the triggering of GPWS. The drill of taking immediate action to
go round in IMC condition and to check the aircraft configuration
should be rigorously practiced during the training. Proper syllabus
be prepared in regard thereto and the instructors be directed to
treat this particular aspect as an independent subject of their
training and the proficiency checks should also take note of pilot's
reaction to the triggering of GPWS.
14.1 (b)(cid:9) Air Traffic Control Officers :
The personnel of the aerodrome discipline of National Air-
ports Authority arc being recruited from the colleges at two levels,
viz. those of Aerodrome Assistants and Aerodrome Officers. The
entry qualification of Aerodrome Assistants is degree in Science or
149

Diploma in Engineering and that for the Aerodrome Officers is
degree in Science or a graduation in engineering or a holder of
Commercial Pilot's Licence. I have been given to understand,
however, that many of the officers recruits are also Post Graduate
degree holders in science.
Re Training Programme for personnel recruited at Assistants level :
Ab-initio Training :
Duration(cid:9) 4 months.
Subjects Taught(cid:9) Basic Concepts of Ae•roclrotue Con-
trol, Theory and Practice including
handling of normal traffle density
situations, and a few emergencies.
Other allied subjects such as Mete-
orology, Air Navigation, Conununica-
Hon Procedures, Navigational Aids,
Aerodrome and Ground Aids, Fire
Fighting and Rescue, Airframe and
Engines, Air Law, and Morse Recep-
tion.
All the subjects are taught only to a
basic level at this stage.
On successful completion of the training, the candidate is
posted as an Aerodrome Assistant at one of the stations, where he
mainly assists the Officers in performance of ATC duties.
Aerodrome Control Course :
This course is taught to the Aerodrome Assistants after they
gain experience of about 6 to 7 years.
150

Duration 16 weeks (Previously 14 weeks)
Subjects Taught Theoretical and Practical Training in
Aerodrome Control, including in
High Density Traffic situations, and
Handling of all emergencies.
The allied subjects are also a taught
in a detailed manner.
On successful completion of this course, the official becomes
eligible to be promoted as Assistant Aerodrome Officer, as per
his/her seniority and as per the number of vacancies available. He
will then undergo OJT and acquire Aerodrome Control rating.
Refresher and Approach Control Course : (Planned now)
After being promoted as Assistant Aerodrome Officer, the
official is being sent to CATC, as per the seniority and the planning
at the CATC, for the Approach control course.
(cid:9)
Duration 10 weeks.
Subjects Taught
Mainly Approach. Control (and Area
Control) in Theory and Practice,
including in High Density Traffic
Situations and handling of all
emergencies.
A refresher and updation of the
other allied courses will also be
given during the course.

Re Training Courses for Aerodrome Officers :
The ab-initio Training for Aerodrome Officers recruited di-
rectly from the open market is for a duration of 12 months, divided
into three modules.
I Module :
(4 months) at CATC Theoretical and Practical Training in
Aerodrome Control, including in
High Density Simulated Traffic
Situations and Handling of emer-
gencies.
Other allied subjects such as Mete-
orology, AGA, Air Navigation,
Conununication Procedures, Naviga-
tional Aids, Fire fighting and Rescue
Services, Morse Reception are also
taught.
II Module :
On the Job Training at one of the
(4 months)
International Airports to the level of
acquiring an Aerodrome Control
Rating, and familiarisation with
other ATC units such as Approach,
Area, Radar.
III Modules :
Theoretical and Practical Training in
(4 months)
Approach Control, including in High
Density Simulated Traffic Situations
in all weather conditions, and
Handling of emergencies.
152

A continuation is made in the teach-
ing of other allied subjects such as
Meteorology, Air Navigation, and,
also Air Law, Airframe and engines
(Technical).
After Completing the CATC Course successfully, the Aero-
drome Officers are posted to one of the International Airports,
where they are given on the job training, leading to acquisition of
the various ratings, as per the procedures enunciated in DARA
Circular 2 of 1990. The period of on-the-job training depends on
the rating being acquired, the station of posting.
Board for Examination:
The board of examination in Practicals in Aerodrome Control
for the Aerodrome Officers consists of three members, one a Direc-
tor from the International Airports, a Deputy Director from the
international airports, and the Chief Instructor ATC, CATC.
The rating boards at the international stations for the var-
ious stations arc as per those enunciated in the DARA Circular 2 of
1990.
Common Courses for those recruited initially as Aerodrome Assist-
ants as also Aerodrome Officers :
The Assistant Aerodrome Officers, after nearly 7 to 8 years of
service in this Cadre of AAOs, get promoted to the rank of Aero-
drome Officer depending on the seniority and number of vacancies.
The Inter-se seniority between the direct recruit Aerodrome
Officers and the Departmentally promoted ones, takes place. at the
level of Aerodrome Officers and their promotion avenues thereafter
are follow a conunon route.
153

Specialised courses such as Search and Rescue Mission
Coordinator and Assistant Mission Coordinators, Radar (Terminal
and Area) and others are open for those of Aerodrome Officers rank
and above.
The minimum qualification for the Radar Course is at least
three years of service in ATC with one year's experience in Ap-
proach/Area Control after acquiring of these ratings.
Procedure for issue of ratings at small stations after the
prescribed period of on-the-job training, is governed by I)ARA
Circular 1 of 1992. With the implementation of this, the system of
issue of ratings has been laid down for all the airports in India
under the N.A.A.
It is noteworthy that a new computer-based state of art
technology ATC Radar Simulator has already been commissioned
and integrated into the training at the Civil Aviation Training
College (CATC) at Allahabad. When I visited the CATC a few days
back, the Radar Simulator equipment was shown to me which is,
in fact, being used for imparting training to Air Traffic Controllers
both for approach and area control in order to maintain safe and
expeditious flow of traffic. I was told that training of Air Traffic
controllers on live aircraft at the airports is so expensive that it
cannot be afforded together with the other possible interference to
the regular aircraft operations and it is for this reason that radar
simulator has been introduced which simulates the exact condi-
tions of flights of aircraft, radar equipment, radio communication
channels, inter-unit ground coordination channels and thus pro-
viding realistic situation to the trainees. It is indeed a noteworthy
project since a trainee can learn through mistakes which is not
otherwise possible in actual field operations. I have been informed
by AVM N.M. Shahul, Member Operations of the National Airports
Authority that this project of CATC is under UNDP and is in
progress to increase the capacity and capability of the training
institute. Equipments worth US $ 1.455 million, have already
154

been added which includes major training aids like radar simula-
tor, tower simulator, desk top publishing system, micro-wave train-
ing kits and personal computer system. As regards the objective of
the project, it includes course standardisation : imparting instru-
mental techniques to the trainers : development of new courses
such as Search & Rescue, Aeronautical Information System, Air-
port Management, Instructional Techniques etc. As a mat ter of
fact, I was introduced to two American consultants who are now
stationed at Allahabad to guide the CATC instructors to achieve
the project objective. I was informed by the foreign consultants
that the radar simulator which has been installed at CATC already
is the best in the world and is comparable to any available at other
training institutes in the world.
During my visit to Australia and Singapore, I discussed the
subject of training of ATCOs with the Civil Aviation Authorities of
these countries. It was noted that in Australia the Air Traffic
Controllers undergo two years initial training consisting of theory,
practical and simulator exercise. After this they have to pass
written examination and undergo on-the-job training during which
they handle air traffic under supervision of check ATCO. After
they pass the checks, they get licence and rating in Tower, Ap-
proach, Area and Radar Control. If a trainee fails during initial
stages of training, his training is discontinued. Iii order to monitor
proficiency of the ATCOs, they undergo proficiency checks every six
months. These checks are carried oul even if the ATCOs continue
to work in the same position. Every ATCO also undergoes medical
examination once in two years if below 45 years of age and once
every year if more than 45 years of age. Whenever an ATCO is
transferred to a new station, he undergoes necessary training and
checks relating to the procedures of the new station before he is
allowed to work independently at that station. Every ATCO is
given familiarisation flights approximately once a year. Qantas
Airways gives six passages to the ATCOs to go and study the Air
Traffic Control procedures of other countries. CAA even charters
aircraft to give flight familiarisation to the ATCOs. The check
155

ATCOs are appointed on merit to fulfil the criteria laid down by
CAA. The ATCOs during their initial training arc also trained in
meteorology and whenever required they give their own meteorolog-
ical observations to flights.
While the Air Traffic Control in Australia is exercised by the
Civil Aviation Authority, major airports are under the control of
Federal Airports Corporation. The ATC and ground aids including
safety services are provided by Civil Aviation Authority. Category-I
ILS is provided at about six major airports and at other airports
facilities like VOR, DME and NIB are provided. Only manual RVR
is provided at present and RVR equipment is being installed at
Sydney airport. At major airports, radar along with the transpon-
der has been provided. All Control Towers at major airports are
manned by only rated ATCOs. In addition to the ATCOs, there is
always a supervisory controller who does not, in fact, handle the
radio transmission, but takes a back seat to have an over-view of
the entire situation though at times he himself transmits on radio
transmission to assist the rated ATCO at the Control Tower. It is
at this junction that I would like to point out that on a suggestion
from the Court the National Airports Authority submitted that the
presence of a supervisor at the Control Tower may dampen the
activeness of the Controller. I do not, however, accept such a
suggestion and record my observation to the effect that the
presence of a Controller will not only improve the situation but will
also enure to the benefit of the Controllers at the Control Tower
for proper and effective management of the Air Traffic Control
System.
The situation as above also prevails in Singapore. There are
three Controllers and one Supervisory Controller at the Control
Tower for effective management of the Air Traffic Control. The
presence of the supervisor not only enures to the benefit as noted
above, but during heavy traffic it is a positive help to the Air 'Prai rie
Controllers. It also avoids the fatigue of the Air Traffic Controller
at the Control Tower.
156

In Australia all Air Traffic Controller are licenced by CAA. If
an ATCO does not work in a unit for 14 days or more, lie has to
work under a Check ATCO for some time depending upon the
period lie has not worked in a unit.
Turning attention to our ATC system, it is placed on record
that on the basis of available evidence on record and the literatures
available in regard thereto, the procedure does not seem to be
lacking in any way so far as the theoretical aspect of such a train-
ing is concerned. Practicability of the situation, however, is slight-
ly different from its theoretical aspect and in that regard I wish to
record certain observations of mine vis-a-vis the training procedure
of the ATCOs and the ratings given to the ATCOs.
Admittedly Air Traffic Control in smaller airports are being
effected by non-rated officers - a situation which is totally unwar-
ranted. I remember having reconunended while dealing with the
Guwahati crash in regard to a Vayudoot aircraft that the National
Airports Authority should ensure that only trained and rated Air
Traffic Controllers should handle the traffic but that recommenda-
tion seems to be On paper only. As a matter of fact, however, I
understand that the Government has thought it fit not to imple-
ment the same. I am at a loss to find such a state of affairs. For
convenience sake, the Reconunendation No.18 of the Report of the
Vayudoot F-27 air crash at Guwahati and the Govermuent's reac-
tion thereto is noted hereinbelow :
Recommendation
"(xviii) National Airports Authority should clearly lay down the
duties and responsibilities of the Aerodrome Assistants and Air
Traffic Control Officers. It should be ensured that only trained and
rated Air Traffic Controllers handle all traffic."
Govermnent's Reaction :
"Recommendation No.18 : In recommendation No.18, National Air-
ports Authority has been advised to lay down the duties and
197

responsibilities of the Aerodrome Assistants and Air Traffic Control
Officers. The Court has recommended that it has to be ensured
that only trained and rated Air Traffic Controllers handle all traffic.
It is mentioned here that the Aerodrome Assistants are trained
persons who are in the process of acquiring operational experience.
It is to be ensured that the ATCO does not abdicate his responsibil-
ity and leave everything to the Aerodrome Assistant, who although
trained, is not competent to handle air traffic control independent-
ly in all types of weather and approach conditions."
It seems that the Govermnent has taken note of the conduct
of the ATCO and his training but has not dealt with the rating of
the ATCOs at all. In the normal course of events, however, it is
deemed that the Government has applied its mind and deliberately
left it out, but considering the seriousness of the matter, I should
have thought that the Government should give some reason as to
the non-acceptance of this recommendation In regard to the rat-
ings of the ATCOs. While it is true that once the Government has
not accepted a recommendation specifically, a High Court Judge
holding an air crash inquiry ought not to recommend it for the
second time, but considering the safety aspect. I cannot but to note
here my anxiety in regard to the ratings of the ATCOs manning
independently the radio transmission at any airport. It is a safety
requirement and as such Govermnent should reconsider its deci-
sion in regard thereto. There should not be any compromise with
safety standard - as noted above. Human lives are precious and
there should not be any laxity or sense of complacency in so far as
the safety sphere is concerned.
It is not out of place to mention that in my earlier report of
the F-27 air crash submitted in March, 1989, I have also recom-
mended the licensing of the ATCOs : this particular recommenda-
tion, even though has been accepted by the Government, but no
step whatsoever has yet been taken in regard thereto. Recommen-
dations are made by the Courts of Inquiry upon proper delibera-
tions and on appraisal of the entire situation and once the Gov-
158

eminent accepts such a recommendation, there should not be any
time gap for its implementation.
Coining back to the factual aspect of the matter in regard to
the Air Traffic Control at Implial Airport, it is seen that the traffic
was handled by one Mr. P. Sengupta, an Air Traffic Control Officer,
independently without being banked by any rated officer by the
Board of the National Airports Authority. The evidence of Mr.
Rastogi being the Senior Aerodrome Officer is a revelation to this
Court. Mr. Rastogi stated that Mr. Sengupta is the only fully quali-
fied ATC Officer for Imphal and to a pointed question as to whether
Sengupta was a rated officer, there was a definite answer to the
affirmative. On being further asked as to who has rated Mr.
Sengupta, the answer of Mr. Rastogi was - "by my predecessor". I
am at a loss to find that how a single individual can rate an officer
giving independent charge of Air Traffic Control at an airport. Mr.
Rastogi explains, however, that at the smaller airport no elaborate
procedure is followed and it is the senior officer who is competent
to judge whether the junior officer has familiarised himself with the
local procedure, local condition, local traffic pattern, local envi-
ronment and the local topography and after observing that the
junior officer is working well and that he is able to handle the
Radio Transmission well then lie is allowed to handle the R/T
independently after giving him the rating. No documentary evi-
dence, however, was produced before this Court as to the certifica-
tion by the senior officer. Mr. Rastogi further elaborated the policy
of the National Airports Authority to the effect that density of night
is the only criteria in the matter of adaptation of the rating proce-
dure at the Control Tower. Mr. Rastogi went on to say that Na-
tional Airports Authority can afford to do away with the rigours in
regard to the independent handling of R/T by the rated officers in
low density flight operational airports. It is the definite evidence of
Mr. Rastogi that "it is only the number of operations, the number
of aircraft operating at any airport which is important to decide
whether he is to be given more elaborate training before handing
over charge independently at an international airport or lie can be
159

handed over charge of a smaller airport after the senior officer who
is present certifies that he is competent to take over the works at
the airport. In this context, Question No.72 and its answer ought
to be noted and which is reproduced hereinbelow
"Q.72 : That is why I am asking you that the level
of flight only would be considered by
National Airports Authority as to what sort
of training would be given to the ATCOs.
If there are more traffic, more rigorous is
the training. If there are less traffic, less
rigorous is the training - is that so ?/ That
is correct."
On the basis of aforesaid, therefore, it appears that the
National Airports Authority maintains dual standards, one for
higher flight density airports and the other for lower flight density
airports. In my considered view, maintenance of dual standard
ought not to be resorted to and all ATCOs should be rated before
allowing them to handle R/T independently irrespective of flight
density. Rating cannot be effected only for the purpose of handling
more aircraft as it has an inbuilt safety device which is also other-
wise required for low flight density airports. There cannot be any
compromise with safety and this policy of the National Airports
Authority thus in my view ought to be dispensed with and same
standard be made applicable to all airports irrespective of the traf-
fic position in regard to the ratings of the ATCO. hi the event of
transfer of the ATCO to a bigger airport further training may be
imparted to the ATCO but that does not mean that the required
training need not be given to an ATCO by way of a rating in smaller
airports.
I would not like to be misunderstood about the capability of
Mr. Sengupta as an Air Traffic Controller, but the observations as
above only pertain to the policy of the National Airports Authority.
The call-outs given by Mr. Sengupta to the aircraft cannot be
termed to be wrong as such though slightly better pliraseolor
could have been used, particularly in regard to the clearance for
direct outbound. No strict exception however, can be taken to
160

such a clearance as above by reason of subsequent call outs by
ATCO being in order.
The other aspect of this issue ought also to be noted at this
juncture. No refresher courses are arranged for the ATCOs. The
National Airports Authority obviously thinks it fit enough not to
provide any refresher course for the ATCO, but in my view, the
ATCO has an equal if not more important role to play in the matter
of air safety vis-a-vis the pilots on board the aircraft. The licensing
of ATCOs would definitely bring in a much more healthier and
safer situation since in that event the DGCA being the regulatory
authority would be able to formulate and provide adequate safety
regulation in regard thereto. Incidentally it is to be noted that. in
my earlier report in regard to the Vayudoot air crash at Guwahati,
I specifically recommended that the refresher courses should be
arranged for ATCOs at least once a year. Even though that
recommendation has been accepted by the Government, but no
step whatsoever has been taken by the National Airports Authority
to implement the same. I understand that the reminders from the
Director General of Civil Aviation's Office has yielded no result
whatsoever.
The availability of ATC tape is also of very great importance
for the purpose of monitoring the proficiency of the ATCOs. The
National Airports Authority would be well advised to have random
checks of the ATC tape so as to ascertain the proficiency of the
ATCOs.
It is not, however, out of context to note the third aspect of
this issue viz. the familiarisation flights for the ATCOs. The Air
Traffic controllers are the persons who guide the aircraft in all
eventualities and they therefore, should have proper appreciation
of the cockpit instruments as otherwise there is likelihood of a
communication gap between the pilot and (lie ground control.
This possibility would not, however, be there in the event of proper
knowledge about the cockpit panel instruments. In the premises
161

familiarisation with the equipments so far as the ATCOs are con-
cerned, in my view, is a question of primary requirement. The
National Airports Authority would be well advised to modulate the
necessary details with least possible delay. This observation of
mine is based upon the fact that the days of Dakotas are over and
we are in a modern Jet age with very high speed fly-by-wire aircraft.
14.1 (c)(cid:9) Electronic/Technical Officers
:
The personnel of Technical discipline of NAA currently are
being recruited from the colleges at two levels namely Electronic
Assistants and Electronic Officers. The entry qualifications of EA
is Diploma in Electrical/Electronic stream or B.Sc (Physics Main).
for Electronic Officers a degree in Engineering (Electronics) or its
equivalent is mandatory.
Training Courses - Basic
The basic training of Electronic/Technical Officers is for 22
weeks. They are trained on basics of VOR, DME, ILS and other
conununication equipments. On successful completion of training,
they are sent to field stations to work under experienced officers
only on general equipments like HF transmitter receiver, VHF
equipment and terminal building equipments like tape recorder
etc. After gaining proficiency on these equipments and experience
of 6 months in the field a EO/TO is proficient to carry out inde-
pendently the requisite maintenance and repair on the above
equipments. At this stage they do not handle specialised nature of
tasks like ILS, DME, VOR, RADAR etc.
Specialised Training
After gaining experience not less than 2 years EO/TOs are
sent for specialised training on RADAR, ILS, VOR, DME, Hight
calibration equipment, AMSS, computer applications, Aeronautical
Mobile services on HF RT. Duration of this training is 6 weeks.
162

Proficiency Assessment
The board comprising of Director from Hqrs. + Chief Instruc-
tor Communication from CATC and one more Instructor from
CATC test the Officers on completion of 22 weeks as well as 6
weeks courses to assess their proficiency and declare them compe-
tent. A certificate is being issued presently by Principal, CATC
both qualifying them initially and also on specialised equipments.
Proficiency on die ground
a) After basic course of 22 weeks and gaining the experience for
6 months the EO/TOs are competent to undertake the tasks
of maintenance of general equipments like HF RT, VHF
equipments and tape recorders.
b) On completion of specialised course of 6 weeks these officers
work under experienced and qualified officers on equipments
like Radar, ILS, VOR and DME for 8-12 weeks to gain profi-
ciency and declare independent to handle the equipments.
In fact, independent posts as EO/TOs to take the charge of
stations are mostly those officers who arc experienced and
proficient to handle such equipments where they are posted.
Electronic/Technical Assistants
EA/TA are given 22 weeks initial course basically to work
under the supervision of qualified EO/TOs. EA at no stage hold
independent charge at any field or station. Their basic training
includes imparting training of Transmitters, receivers, lest. equip-
ments and Jobs like soldering etc. The TA course is designed to
appreciate the problems involved in the maintenance of both
preventive as well as general maintenance and lend services to ihe
qualified EO/TOs in their conduct of trouble-shooting and mainte-
nance of the equipments.
163

Proficiency Assessment
Like in the case of EO/TOs their proficiency assessment is
done by three members comprising of local board from within
CATC and assess accordingly.
Assistant Technical Officers
ATO is not direct recruitment but a promotee from EA/TA.
An EA/TA after completing at least 5 years becomes eligible for
promotion to ATO depending upon the efficiency and in their own
turn. For this purpose they arc sent to CATC for qualifying course
which is of the duration of 12 weeks. Like• in the case of Aero-
drome discipline, those officers who do not make the grade are
sent back and here also these are given 3 chances to make the
grade. On gaining requisite proficiency an ATO is allowed to work
on equipments like tape recorders, VHF/HF, NDB, X-Ray baggage
and some specialised equipments. Iii small stations where there is
only NDB or X-Ray Baggage, an ATO also posted as independent
charge of the station.
Updatement
The courses, like in the case of Aerodrome discipline, are
updated periodically by the CATC after getting requisite approval
from the Hqrs. The UNDP project association with CATC aims for
enhancing the capability of Technical discipline in the NAA.
General
I understand that in the past, there were two streams in the
Technical stream at the time of entry namely Technical Assistants
and Commtmication Assistants and secondly Technical Officer/
Communication Officer. Technical Officers used to deal with
technical disciplines like maintenance etc. whereas communication
164

officers dealt with basically communication aspects of the opera-
tions. This was the age old pattern followed by the DGCA. After
the formation of the National Airports Authority, it was felt as I
have been informed that some highly and well-qualified technical
officers were being lost in general stream of Communication disci-
pline and hence the new concept known as Electronic Assistants
and Electronic Officers was introduced for better utilisation of
human resources. This changed system as appears, had started
about two years back and five batches of students of Electronic
Assistants as well as Electronic Officers have passed out. from
CATC so far. The 6th one is undergoing training currently.
It is to be made clear, however, that maintenance of these
highly sophisticated ground equipments being
,the navigational and
landing aids for the aircraft, should be effected in a highly profes-
sional manner and only competent and efficient people ought to be
engaged therefor. The system maintained by the Engineering
Department of Indian Airlines by way of written schedule checks, I
feel, ought to be introduced in the matter of regular maintenance
of these equipments. The same would not only enure to the proper
maintenance of (lie equipment but also obliterate (lie possibility of
human errors in the matter of maintenance of these sophisticated
equipments.
14.1 (d)(cid:9)
Cabin Crew Training :
During the entire course of hearing, both at Calcutta and at
Imphal no submissions have been made on behalf of the cabin
crew in spite of notices being served on to the union of the cabin
crew of Indian Airlines. It is only in the morning of 27th April that
my Secretary has made over the original of the affidavit filed by the
cabin crew union. Scathing remarks have been made in the affi-
davit as regards the training procedure of the crew members of
Indian Airlines by reason wherelor I had no other option but to
send a questionaire to the Director of Operations through Capt.
P.M. Jog and I also received the reply thereto on the same day.
165

It has been stated in the affidavit that :
i) There is no standardised training in Indian Airlines.
ii) The duration of each course of training progranuiie varies as
per the whims and fancies of the management of Indian
Airlines since there is no adherence to the definite time and
lecture hour for different subjects of training.
111)(cid:9) There is no control whatsoever on the part of DGUA in re-
spect of the training of the cabin crew.
iv) No fire drill training is provided to the cabin crew by reason
of non-availability of a 'Mock Aircraft'.
v) The management of the Indian Airlines does not also deem it
fit to take the assistance of Air India for training of their
cabin crew members.
The Indian Airlines, however, in their reply categorically
disputed the above noted submissions of the union and stated that
there are prescribed syllabus for cabin crew and the Indian Airlines
have abinitio training course which is the basic training course
given after the cabin crew are recruited and before they are sent on
flight. The duration of this course is 8 weeks on ground training
for a batch of 25 trainees. Four flights on each type of aircraft are
given as on-the-job training. Apart therefrom the Indian Airlines
stated that yearly refresher courses are conducted for all cabin
crew at the regions and there is a prescribed syllabus for such a
refresher course. The duration of the refresher course is three
days for a batch of 10 to 12 cabin crew. The Indian Airlines stated
that in addition to these courses, the airlines has conversation
courses for the new aircraft as and when required and the duration
of these courses depend on the quantum of information to be
imparted to the trainees. As regards the fire drills, the answer was
166

V
in the affirmative and so is in regard to ditching drill and evacua-
tion training to the cabin crew. The syllabus for cabin crew train-
ing was also sent along with the reply of the Indian Airlines which
provide a 60 hours course and cannot but be termed to be satisfac-
tory in nature. On the score of training of pilots and ATCOs and
other technical officers, I have recorded my observations that there
is some amount of difference between theoretical scope of training
and actual imparting of such a training to the trainees. The cabin
crew themselves feel it that the training imparted is not sufficient,
the management should, therefore, see to it that time training Lo be
imparted on to the cabin crew ought to be standardised and there
ought not to be any departure from the training standard as pre-
scribed.
While dealing with the matter two other issues which have
been raised by the Union ought to be noted, namely, the FDTL and
the fatigue of the cabin crew. As regards FDTL, the affidavit point-
edly records that the cabin crew members ought to work at a
stretch for 11 hours in a calendar day. The affidavit goes on to
record, however, that this 11 hours a day duty time was arrived at
though bilaterally in the agreement with the operator and the
union but in fact it becomes too much 'of a burden for the cabin
crew to work for 11 hours a day and the same might, therefore,
endanger the flight safety. There cannot be any manner of doubt
that 11 hours a day duty for a cabin crew may turn out to be very
stranuous but the operator has stated that normally they are
rostered in such a way that the duty time does not. exceed 5 to 6
hours a day and it is only when the standby cabin crew are pulled
out due to exigencies they may be required to work upto a maxi-
mum off 11 hours a day as per the agreed FDTL. It, therefore,
appears that under the normal circumstances the duty hour being
not more than 5 to 6 hours, no exception can be taken and it is
only in emergency situation that this FDTL is taken recourse to by
the operator, but these are exceptions and exceptions cannot
termed to be the rules as such I do not find any serious objection
in regard thereto at least till such time a new agreement is arrived
167

at by and between the union and the management of the Indian
Airlines. The agreement has a binding force and it is not for this
Court to comment thereon rather for the parties to the agreement
to change the terms.
The issue as regards the fatigue is also co-related with the
FDTL and by reason of my obseervation in regard to FDTI, I do not
wish to record any finding in regard to the issue of fatigue as well
excepting, however, stating herein that the operator should look
into the issue without much loss of time.
14.2 Frequent Flying on one route by the pilot
:
While it is true that familarisation with a particular
terrain is required for a safe flight, but frequent flying in one route
is likely to give a bit of a over-confidence to the pilot, though
however, Capt. Mehta while deposing before the Court stated that
question of being over-confident does not and cannot arise so far
as flying is concerned. Considering, however, the human mind
and the psychology, I am not in a position to concur with the
statement of Capt. Mehta. It came on record that Capt. Haider had
operated 36 flights from Calcutta to Imphal within a period of
preceding six months. A question had arisen as to why he was
operating so frequently on this route. Capt. Mehta in this regard
stated that if a commander wants to fly on the same route, there is
no bar in the Indian Airlines regulations. lie also clarified that in
case of Boeing 737 aircraft they have only two or three command-
ers at the Calcutta base and other Boeing 737 pilots come from
Delhi and Bombay for operating flights in Calcutta region. If these
commanders do not turn up then the pilots based at Calcutta may
be sent on one particular route and one sector only. When lie was
asked that if a pilot wants a particular route, do they give that
particular route whenever he wanted; Capt. Mehla replied that if
the connm-mder requests it can be accepted. He also clarified that
any change in the roster duties cannot be done by the pilot himself
without the permission of the roster-incharge.
168

Shri S.K. Srivastava, Deputy Manager Flight Operations,
who was incharge in the roster Section of Boeing pilots at Calcutta
at the relevant period and who was rosting Boeing pilots was asked
how Capt. Haider had flown so many flights to Imphal, it was
stated that some flights were given to Capt. balder on his request
and some were given by them depending on the prevailing situa-
tion. Shri Srivastava informed that Capt. balder sometimes used
to request for flights to Imphal. He, however, never asked why
Capt. Haider was asking for flights to Imphal.
Considering the above, in my view, Capt. Haider had a bit
too much of familiarity with the terrain which may have brought
about a feeling of over-confidence in him which by all standards
ought to be done away with and the operator would be well advised
to give due consideration to this aspect.
The observations as above also find support from the infra-
cockpit conversation at 07:08:44 UTC to the effect "You are exactly
- - This is 25 miles Roger Aye Ekta Hill Range, Oye Ekta Hill Range
- Do Tor MaJh Khanne" (This is one 11111, that is another hill and in
between the two), which goes to show how familiar the pilot was
with the terrain and the pilot knew exactly what he was doing.
This indicates that he was giving distance call-outs and positioning
himself not on the basis of any instrument reading or estimate
calculations but on some ground features with which he was very
14.3 Pre-flight Medical Checks of Crew:
Though I have already dealt with this aspect of the matter in
regard to the pre-flight medical check up, but I wish to made cer-
tain general observations in regard thereto and hence a special
mention is being made.
As noted above human lives are precious and it is on one
169

particular person that these lives are dependent on board the
aircraft as such this particular person being the Pilot-in-Conunand
of the aircraft should be under no inconvenience of whatsoever
nature. Proper mental equilibrium ought to be maintained and for
this purpose this pre-flight medical check has been envisaged by
the Director General of Civil Aviation and the operator has been
asked to assure such a state so far as the pilot is concerned. It is
now on record that the Indian Airlines has the system of pre-flight
medical checks by doctors in the roll of Indian Airlines. The certif-
icates produced before the Court in regard to the two pilots of the
ill-fated flight (1C-257), however, leave much to be desired in the
matter of pre-flight medical check-ups. The proforma has been
made out on which the doctor is to give a certificate, but apparent-
ly the doctor does not have the time to write even at the columns
specified for alcohol checks. A plain look at the certificate show
that the certification is to the detection of abnormality in the pilot
only, since it records "NAD" (No Abnormality Detected) - what did
the doctor mean by that. - did he expect that the pilot would behave
abnormally in the morning when he has come to operate a flight -
did he expect that the piliA would be so drunk that he will not be
able to walk properly - did he expect that the pilot would be using
languages which cannot and does not befit a gentleman : it never
occurred to the operator that this cannot be a proper certification
for a proper medical check up. The administration of the operator
ought to rise up to the occasion to §ee that the proforma envisaged
for medical check-ups is being dealt with by their medical officers
in the proper spirit for which it has been so devised. It is not out
of context to note that some days back a newspaper report ap-
peared recording therein the protests of the pilot in the matter of
monitoring the alcohol checks by DGCA officials. I should have
thought that the pilots themselves would volunteer for such a
check as otherwise the entire ethics of flying would be in jeopardy.
In any event, I do not see any justification of such criticism or
protest since it is only for public safety that these checks are
monitored. Be that as it may, the operator would be well advised
to look into this aspect of the matter also and see that this medical
170

check up is effected in a manner as is conducive to safe flying
rather than in a slip-shod fashion as is evident from the pre-llight
medical check reports of Capt. Shekhar Flakier and Capt. D.B. Roy
Chaudhary.
It will, however, be worthwhile to record that in Australia
there is no pre-Hight medical check-up. On being asked about the
danger of not having a morning pre-flight medical check-up,
prompt came the reply from the Qantas that the pilots of the
Qantas Airways are so self-disciplined that such a check is not
required. The Airways has framed a regulation that no pilot
should have a drink after 8 O'clock in the evening if they are oper-
ating any flight next day morning till noon- time and the pilots
themselves stop drinking as a matter of fact before that time and
under no circumstances shall continue with the drink after 8 p.m.
If the operator can introduce such a culture in its system, I
am also inclined to believe that no pre-flight medical check-up
would be needed since trust and confidence on to the pilots can
bring home itself the strictest of regulatory methods.
1 4.4Search & Rescue
Search and Rescue are the two most important aspects in
the civil aviation industry in the country. I am constrained to say
that the National Airports Authority has had no training pro-
gramme in regard thereto until very recently. Now, of course, a
training prograrrune with a search and rescue course objective has
been framed and the course duration being - four weeks and entry
level is only from experienced Aerodrome Officers and Senior
Aerodrome Officers - a welcome course undoubtedly, since human
lives may be lost by reason of delayed search and rescue. Time
has now come up for consideration of all the agencies involved in
the Civil Aviation industry to sit down and evaluate some proce-
dure so that this particular issue of search and rescue is given its
171

due importance. Though the para-military forces and the local
police administration may be approached for necessary assistance,
but that does not mean and imply that the agencies involved with
the Civil Aviation of the country will be a mere passive spectator
whilst others cracking their head to effect the search and rescue of
the victims of an air crash.
Mr. Rastogi in course of his evidence, in no uncertain terms
stated that it was no part of his duty to take steps in the matter of
search and rescue in the event the aircraft accident takes place
beyond the airport vicinity. This attitude of the Senior Aerodrome
Officer, I am sorry to note, cannot be appreciated. This shows that
the Senior Aerodrome Officer lacks a sense of responsibility to the
safety of the passengers. I understand that•as early as 1976-77
the Civil Aviation Directorate, Goveriunent of India has published a
booklet entitled 'Organisation and Procedure for Search and
Rescue of aircraft in distress' containing the detailed procedure
including a chapter on the definitions of the expressions used
therein. The appendix I to the booklet itself provides the names of
the officers who should be responsible for the search and rescue
operation in the event of there being any unfortunate incident and
invariably it is the Regional Director of the Region who have been
stated to head the search and rescue service. The National Air-
ports Authority being a successor of the then DGCA excluding the
regulatory functions ought therefore be made responsible for such
a rescue operation and I fail to appreciate the evidence of Mr.
Rastogi being the Senior Aerodrome Officer to the effect as noted
above viz. he has no responsibility for search and rescue in the
event the rescue operation is outside the airport area since it will
then be the duty of the State authority to organise the search and
rescue. I record my utter dissatisfaction to this particular piece of
evidence of Mr. Rastogi.
Incidentally it is to be noted that it took quite sonic• f lute to
locate the wreckage and had there been a Emergency Locator
Transmitter (ELT), this delay In locating the wreckage could have
172

been avoided. Though it is true, however, that there were no
survivors and the deaths were instantaneous, 1)111 it is always
advisable and better for all concerned to locate the wreckage at the
earliest possible opportunity and as such installation of an ELT is
of primary importance. I understand that the Director General of
Civil Aviation has already issued a directive about the installation
of the ELTs in all aircrafts and for passenger aircrafts the time
limit given by the Director General is upto 30th April, 1.992. I
hereby record my appreciation for the steps taken by the Director
General in that direction. I have, however, been informed that
though the operator (Indian Airlines) has installed an ELT instru-
ment in their aircraft, but the same is water activated type only
and not impact activated. The Director General, however, should
make it a point to see that, in fact, the impact as also the water
activated system are introduced in all passenger aircraft as early
as possible and in default of such a step by the operator, necessary
regulatory steps be taken without any compromise whatsoever
since it is an essential requirement for search and rescue.
14.5 Accident Prevention Cell
In the introduction chapter of this report, 1 have stated that
monetary compensation or a word of sympathy will not do - we will
have to rise up to the occasion to stop the recurrence of these
accidents which is otherwise avoidable in nature. I also recorded
that the tune and hour has come for us to do our utmost to save
such fatalities - this observation of mine is not out of context at all
since it is always better to take a preventive action rather than to
do a post mortem action. Our endeavour should be directed to
avoid such accidents and with that perspective in the earlier report
I recommended that there should be a new dedicated cell tor acci-
dent prevention work. I understand that the cell has been created
by the DGCA and has been duly approved by the Ministry, but
what surprised Inc most, is the personnel of the cell - there is only
one post of an officer sanctioned by the Government for the cell. I
do not understand as to how sanction to one post could be made
173

in a cell which is supposed to be working for prevention of acci-
dents. It has come in evidence that even the airports have not
been inspected for years together, far apart of having a total super-
visory capability of the cell for prevention work. Implementation of
the recommendations of the earlier Courts of Inquiries is also a
part of the duty of the special cell and by reason of the non-avail-
ability of the personnel, the status in regard thereto is also far from
satisfactory. The other function which the special cell ought to
discharge is the monitoring of the FDRs, DFDRs and CVRs - is that
humanly possible for one person to do for the prevention of acci-
dents - the answer cannot but be in the negative. It seems that the
Goverrunent has not appreciated the proper spirit with which this
particular recommendation was made as otherwise the action of
the Government in implementation thereof would not have been in
the same fashion as it has, in fact, been effected. I hereby empha-
sise again that there should be a proper and adequately staffed
special cell under DGCA for the prevention of accidents and the
Government should rise upto the occasion and to take effective
steps for such prevention of accidents.
14.G Control Tower Equipments
a)(cid:9) ATC Tapes
ATC tape is one of the primary instruments located at the
Control tower, it has to discharge definite functions and an effec-
tive method to cross-check the transmissions from both the air-
craft as also from the ground. This also serves the vital need of
monitoring the actions of both the pilots and the ATCOs.
Unfortunately, however, the evidence disclosed before the
Court that the ATC tape at Imphal Airport has not been commis-
sioned for the last about eight years. It is indeed a sorry state of
affairs - can we in this country afford to keep an expensive equip-
ment in unserviceable condition for a period of eight years when
there is so much of economic constraints in the national financial
174

position - this is apart from the safety aspect and its utility as a
Control Tower equipment - in my view, the answer cannot but be
in the negative. Nobody seems to be bothered about the equip-
ment lying at Imphal Airport for such a long period of time. Mr.
Rastogi has stated that it required some spares. The Senior Aero-
drome Officer ought to be slightly more careful and particular in
regard to the equipments at the Control Tower. The matter,
however, needs further investigation by the National Airports
Authority and appropriate steps be taken against the delinquent
officer or officers.
b) Status Indicator Lights
It seems to be a perpetual problem in the North-Eastern
region of the country. While I was investigating the Guwahati air
crash, the same state of affairs as regards the status indicator
lights existed - if the National Airports Authority thinks it fit
enough not to maintain the status indicator lights at the Control
Tower then why have an indicator light - obviously the NAA has the
impression that unserviceability of the status indicator lights does
not really matter. I, however, have a different opinion In the
matter and in my view, maintenance of the status indicator lights
at the Control Tower is imperative as that would provide an
immediate indication as to the serviceability of the landing and
navigational aids at the airport. It helps the ATCO to conununicate
the status to the pilot and as such is a safety requirement and the
National Airports Authority would be well advised to see the serv-
iceability of the status indicator lights at the Control Tower.
c) RVR Indications
Runway Visual Range (RVR) equipment is a definite assist-
ance in the matter of assessment of the visibility in the runway
direction of the airport area. In the absence of RVR equipment, the
ATCO shall have to depend on the subjective assessment of the
visibility of the Meteorologist of the airport, but with a RVR equip-
175

merit the indications at the Tower would appear and as such more
or less correct visibility prevailing at that point of time would be
transmitted to the pilot of the aircraft. This undoubtedly would be
a very great assistance to the pilots as also to the ATCO at the time
of instrument approach and landing during unfavourable weather
conditions.
14.7 Implementation of earlier Recommendations
During the course of hearing, Capt. Bagchi appearing for the
Air Passengers Association laid special emphasis in regard to the
implementation of the earlier recommendations. I record my
concurrence with the submission of Capt. Bagchi. Even at the cost
of repetition, it is to be emphasised that Courts of Inquiry deal with
the matter in very great detail upon evidence and on perusal of
necessary documents - it applies its mind and considering the
requirement of the situation - the recommendations are made. It
is, therefore, a prime requirement that the recommendations so
accepted by the government ought to be implemented without any
time lag and with utmost expedition with all sincerity and in the
spirit in which, it has been recommended. The implementation of
the reconunendations ought to be effected though by the Govern-
ment, but the Director General of Civil Aviation has a definite role
to play in the matter of bringing home the acceptance of the
recommendations by the Govermnent. The Secretary in the Minis-
try of Civil Aviation should have periodic review as regards the
implementation of such recommendations. It ought to be a joint
and concerted effort of all concerned in the Civil Aviation industry
of the country for safe flying of the passengers.
14.8 Operator's Flight Safety Directorate
In accordance- with the normal practice of an Airline opera-
tor, the Indian Airlines is also on record has a Flight Safety Direc-
torate. I emphasise the word "On record". This emphasis is by
reason of the fact that it existed only on record and not on actuali-
ty of the situation. No evidence has been tendered before this
176

Court of Inquiry as to the functioning of the Flight Safety Director-
ate excepting for the last few months. As a matter of fact, the
documentary evidence disclosed that prior to September, 1991, no
meeting of the Flight Safety Committee in the Directorate of Flight
Safety of the operator did take place - is it a conceivable situation
that an organisation like Indian Airlines will not have any meeting
of the Flight Safety Committee for a period of three years - the
answer obviously would be In the negative.
I must, however, appreciate the gesture and sense of duty of
the present Director of Flight Safety in the matter of production of
this piece of evidence before the Court. It is for the first time in
three years that the present Director Capt. P.M. Jog has brought
about a meeting of the Committee in his Directorate so as to bring
a healthy situation in flight safety in the country so far as domestic
operations are concerned. For convenience sake the docuiiientaiy
evidence made available to this Court is reproduced hereinbelow:
INDIAN AIRLINES ligRs.
(Directorate of Flight Safety)
2GIli Sept. 1991
Sub: Flight Safety Committee Meeting held on 12th Sept., 1991.
This Flight Safety Committee Meeting was held after a period
of 3 years. All the invitees excepting 0.M., Madras, were present.
After conducting the meeting for regular Agenda points, all the
OMs along with Director of Training, Director of Operations and
Director flight Safety continued meeting after the lunch time.
During this meeting Director flight Safety pointed out that the
number of accidents/incidents that are taking place is alarming
and asked the invitees to discuss on the subject.
Most of the members agreed that in order to improve the
safety records of the Corporation., it is a must, that the flights are
monitored for standard operating procedures.
For this Directorate to monitor any deviation from the stand-
ard operating procedure it is a must, that we should get the Hight
Recorders (CVR/FDRS) in time and also the readings of such Flight
Recorders must be reliable. However, it is to our utmost dismay,
that we find such required Flight Recorders are either not made
available in time or data is not reliable. We have time and again
raised memos and letters to the engineering Directorate, with
copies to you regarding non-availability of Flight Recorders and its
177

ir
reliability. however, we do not find any improvement. Under the
circumstances it is rather difficult for this Directorate to maintain
the required vigil.
It was also agreed in the meeting that OM's and Dy. OM's
will conduct series of observation flights. Such checks will not be
less than 10 per month.
The undersigned also suggested that in order to develop
personal relationship between senior Commanders and line Pilots,
small batches of pilots for each Dy. OM may be formed and such
batches must meet at least once in 10 days. Such meetings will
not only develop personal relationship between the junior and the
senior pilots but also will help in getting the feedback of any short
comings which may be existing. This also will develop OM's agreed
that this sort of teams will be formulated from the month of Octo-
ber and will start functioning.
This is for your information and suggestion, if any.
Sd/-
(Capt. P.M. Jog)
Director Flight Safety
Flight Safety Directorate of an Airline operator is a necessary
requirement for internal monitoring of their own performance
vis-a-vis the passengers safety. The operator depending upon his
experience evolves the safety method in regard to the compliance of
the safety regulations as enunciated by the Directorate under the
Director General of Civil Aviation. There shall have to be an intro-
spection and the operator should realise the various safety aspects
in passenger flying - can it be said that the operator has been
doing things in accordance with the expected standard of flight
safety - on the basis of the documentary evidence disclosed before
this Court, I am afraid the answer cannot but be a positive 'No'.
The entire Directorate if I may record should be, revamped and
restructured since a feeling of insecurity is gradually gaining
ground in the minds of the air passengers in the country.
I cannot help but record my observations that the Flight
Safety Directorate though needs to be headed by a very experi-
enced pilot but after taking over charge his flying similar to that of
a line pilot should not be permitted but he should be allowed to
obtain compensatory allowances as if lie was, in fact, flying. As a
178

matter of fact, the executives of the operator ought not to be asked
to fly as they are now flying. While it is true that Capt. Mehta
being the former Operations Manager, Calcutta Region, in no
uncertain terms stated that the executives though flying have
enough time even otherwise to look after the institution as a whole
and to frame the policies of the operator for safe flying of air
passengers. I however cannot concur with the evidence of Capt.
Mehta. The company has formulated a policy of 65 ilying hours in
a month for the line pilots as against the maximum of 125 hours
as appears from the Aircraft Rules. The executive pilots, it is in
evidence do invariably fly more than 65 hours as they do not have
the FDTL for 65 hours, though however it shall have to be within
the prescribed limit of 125 hours as noted above. Can an execu-
tive pilot after say flying nearly about 70 to 80 hours a month
devote much time and energy for the purposes of administrative
works - I have my definite reservations about the same. Consider-
ing the process of thinking and the time required for uplifting the
standard of flying if the concerned executive is busy in flying only".
Somebody should be made available to devote some time and
energy for the betterment of the organisation in all its spheres, be
it operational, engineering, commercial or safety. The system
prevalent, however, does not have such an opportunity. The
executives obviously would be flying to stations which provide for a
night halt and if two such flights are taken in a week that would
mean an imply that the concerned executive is not available at the
station for a period of four days in a week - can an organisational
set up be improved in the event of a departmental head being away
from the station for a period of four days - I am afraid even to a
conunon man the answer would be in the negative. The procedure
prevalent in Australia as noted earlier in this report ought to be
considered at this juncture.
Time has now thus come for appraisal of the whole situation
so that flight safety in any way be not in jeopardy. Incidentally it is
to be noted that Aircraft Manual as published by Government of
India though elborate in nature but does not, however, contain any
179

note or regulation as regards the air safety and considering the
situations prevailing in the civil aviation industry in the country, hi
my view, it is high time that the legislature may ponder over it
afresh to incorporate some rules relating to air safety in the Air-
craft Rules itself.
14.9 Present System of Accident Investigation
During the course of hearing, a doubt has been expressed as
regards the method of investigation of accidents including the
appointment of Inspector of Accidents. In terms of Rule 71 of the
Aircraft Rules framed under the Aircraft Act 1934, the Director
General may order an investigation of any accident involving an
aircraft and the Rule prescribes the method and mode of investiga-
tion, the powers of the Inspector of Accidents have been laid down
under Rule 72. This appointment of Inspector of Accidents pertain
to any reportable accident and Rule 75 authorises the Central
Government to have a formal investigation if it is found to be so
expedient. The language of Rule 75 is clear and unambiguous.
Rule 75 provides that where it appears to the Central Government
that. it is expedient to hold a Ibrinal investigation of an accident., it
may whether or not an investigation or an inquiry has been made
under Rule 71 or Rule 74 by order direct a formal investigation to
be held - it therefore appears that the legislature has conferred
power on to the Central Government irrespective of an earlier
investigation by the Inspector of Accidents to hold a formal investi-
gation. There is no conflict neither there is any difficulty in the
matter of constituting a Court of Inquiry, for the accident, since not
all accidents are being investigated by constitution of a Court of
Inquiry by the Central Govermnent. The expressions "whether or
not an investigation or an inquiry has been made under Rule 71 or
74", makes the position amply clear.
The legislative intent is clear enough in Rule 75. In my view.
considering the inunediate need for maintenance and preservations
of materials, appointment of an inspector is of utmost importance.
180

hmnediately after the accident if the materials are not collected,
there is every likelihood of the evidence being lost since some
amount of delay in the matter of formation of the Court caiuiot be
avoided. The notification shall have to be published upon consid-
eration of certain details which cannot be done immediately 011 the
happening of the accident. Considering the above, the legislature
also has left it to the discretion of the Director General of Civil
Aviation in regard to the appointment of an Inspector of Accidents.
In my view, no exception can be taken to the present system of
accident investigation rather I would like to put on record that
without the appointment of an Inspector of Accident, it would be a
near impossibility to come to a definite finding by reason of the
unavoidable time lag. It is to be noted, however, that there is not
even a remote possibility of any conflict between the report of the
Inspector of Accident and that of the Court since immediately on
formation of the Court of Inquiry the Inspector of Accident acts in
terms of the direction of the Court and not independently on its
own.
14.10 Regulatory Functions of D.G.C.A.:
Prior to the formation of the National Airports Authority, the
entire Civil Aviation chapter was being monitored by the Director-
ate under the Director General of Civil Aviation, but after the
formation of the Authority as above, there is bifurcation of the
powers of the Directorate including some of the regulatory func-
tions as well, though however, the Directorate under the Director
General of Civil Aviation continue to remain the regulatory authori-
ty of the Civil Aviation of this country. In my view, however,
though National Airports Authority may continue to discharge its
functions as has been laid down in the statute constituting the
National Airports Authority, but there should be in addition to the
authority a regulatory authority so that the entire civil aviation
industry can be brought under the vigilent supervision of the
regulatory authority. During the course of hearing, it has come to
light that airport minima is one such sphere wherein the DGCA
181

has no role to play in fixation of the same. The Directorate of the
Director General of Civil exists for safe flying in and around and
over the country. Airport minima is a safety measure which
should also come within the powers of the regulatory authority.
Preparation of ILS chart is another sphere wherein the intervention
of the Directorate under DGCA cannot be undermined. These are
all safety measures and there ought to be sonic such supervision
by the regulatory authority as otherwise in the event of an unfor-
tunate eventualities there would be an attempt to shift the respon-
sibility from one to the other. Needless to say and as I understand
that it is neither feasible nor practicable for even the Directorate to
function with its depleted staff pattern - aerodromes admittedly are
not being inspected for operational standards for years together.
Regular monitoring of FDRs; DFDRs; CVRs and ATC tapes cannot
be effected in the manner as is expected. The entire organisation,
therefore, needs restructuring and revamping to facilitate the
Directorate to discharge its regulatory functions. Incidentally it is
not out of context to note that various other Courts of Inquiries
including my earlier report highlighted this aspect of the matter,
but unfortunately, however, no step as yet has been taken by the
Government in that direction despite acceptance of the recommen-
dations by the Government. I wish to put on record that this
aspect of the matter ought to be looked into and be dealt with
utmost promptitude so far as the Government is concerned, as
there cannot possibly be any compromise with the safety of the
public at large. It is further to be noted that with the increasing
air transport activity including coming into existence of the Air
Taxi operations, the role of DGCA cannot in any way be under-
mined and the Govermnent would be well advised to rise up to the
occasion so that the Directorate functions effectively and in the
true spirit in which it was formed as early as 1927.
14.11 Formation of an Independent Air Safety Board :
After a series of fatal accidents in the last three years in
which three jets of Indian Airlines and two aircraft of Vayudoot
182

were involved in which a few hundred precious lives were lost,
there is a growing concern amongst the travelling public of this
country that all is not well with air safety. While it is appreciated
that strenuous efforts are being made by the DGCA in inculcating
a sense of discipline amongst the air crew and improving the
maintenance standards of the airlines, it cannot be gainsaid that
there are limitations to the DGCA due to various constraints which
have been pointed out elsewhere in this report.. Observations have
also been made on the functioning of the Directorate of Flight
Safety in the airlines. A new dimension is getting added to the
aviation sector of this country by the opening up of the skies to the
private air taxi operators. It is understood that most of these
operators are using relatively older generation of aircraft procured
on lease from outside India. It has also to be appreciated that a
very careful watch has to be kept on the operation of these air
taxies as they would not have all the facilities required for excel-
lence in maintenance and adequacy of air safety.
Taking all these factors into account, it is considered neces-
sary particularly in the context of growing volumes of air traffic in
the country and the travelling public must also be well informed
and be apprised of the measures taken by the Government, the
regulatory authority and the airlines ought to ensure their safety.
It has also to be noted that unlike in the case of other modes of
transport, a major air accident could also affect innocent citizens
on the ground. In order to achieve the purpose of having a close
interaction between the people who use air travel and those who
provide it, apart from the regulatory body which cannot always
inter-act with the public, it is considered necessary to form a body
consisting of experts, prominent members of the travelling public
and those involved in the investigation of air accidents who could
periodically meet and have intensive inter-action with all the
agencies connected with the air travel such as the DGCA, the
Airports Authorities, the Airlines and above all the Ministry of Civil
Aviation. It is to be noted that this body would not otherwise
involve itself in the day-to-day functions, but would function as a
183

body to improve the air safety in the country and the periodic
inter -action with all agencies connected with air travel would
enable also the travelling public to feel confident that all agencies
are taking adequate steps and measures to ensure their safety.

15. FINDINGS OF FACTS :
1)
The aircraft had valid Certificate of Airworthiness and was
maintained in accordance with the approved maintenance
schedules. The aircraft was fully airworthy prior to its
departure from Calcutta and during the course of the entire
flight.
2)
The flight crew had appropriate and valid licences to operate
the flight. Both the pilots have been medically fit throughout
their flying career.
3)
The weather at Imphal at the time of crash was - visibility 7
Kins., Clouds 3/8
800 feet, 5/8 1800 feet, 1/8 cb 3000
feet, 8/8 10,000 feet - which was above the operator's
weather minima for an ILS approach at Imphal.
4)
The ATCO had passed to the aircraft the weather prevailing
at 0630 UTC but had not passed the weather of 0700 UTC
which was same as of 0630 UTC except that 1/8 cb 3,000
feet was not prevailing at 0630 UTC. The cb was however,
located in the North-East direction of the airport whereas the
aircraft approached form South-West direction. The upper
wind at 3.1 Kms (10,160 feet) estimated by India
Meteorological Department at 0600 UTC was 120710 Knots.
5)
The landing and navigational aids (ILS, VOR & NDB) at
Imphal Aerodrome were functioning normally on the day of
the accident. Locator Beacons at ILS markers however, have
not been provided. The last calibration was effected on 5th
June, 1991 and was valid on the date of the accident.
6)
Status indicator lights of ILS were not functioning in the
Control Tower on the day of the accident and had, in fact,
been in such a state for quite some time past.
185

7) DME co-located with VOR had not been installed till the day
of accident even though NAA had received the equipment at
Imphal in July, 1991. The DME, however, was subsequently
installed and made operational on 29th November, 1991.
8) Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) is a helpful
navigational aid but cannot be termed to be an essential
navigational aid. Non-availability of DME at Imphal has not
contributed to the accident.
9) Installation of Automatic Direction Finder - AD-200 at
Imphal Airport is not considered necessary on the threshold
of 21st century, more so by reason of the availability of VOR
which is a modern navigational and more effective pilot
interpreted aid.
10) At Imphal there is no equipment installed to provide Runway
Visual Range information which would be of great assistance
to the pilots for carrying out instrument approach and
landing during unfavourable weather conditions.
11) ATC multi-channel tape recorder supplied by Stencil
Hoffman of USA was procured by National Airports Authority
and received at Imphal in early 1983, but has not yet been
installed even after nine years of procurement.
12) By reason of non-availability of the ATC tape at the Control
Tower at Imphal, performance monitoring of ATCOs has
become an extremely difficult.
13)
ATCOs are not having sufficient familiarisation flights.
14)
Air Traffic Control at Imphal Airport on the day of the
accident was manned by an officer not formally rated by
National Airports Authority, though the concerned ATCO had
been informally authorised to handle the air traffic by a
senior officer at Imphal.

15) The Senior Aerodrome Officer being a formally rated Air
Traffic Controller, was available at the aerodrome but not at
the Control Tower at the time of the crash.
16)
No refresher courses are arranged by National Airports
Authority for their Air Traffic Controllers.
17)
Licensing of Air Traffic Controllers has not yet been effected.
18)
Licensing of aerodromes also has not yet been effected.
19)
There are no maintenance schedules for ground navigation,
communication and landing aids.
20)
The flight crew did not adhere to the operational flight plan
after coming overhead Comilla. They did not go overhead
Agartala VOR and instead flew almost directly to Imphal
from Comilla.
21) The flight crew gave incorrect call-out to Agartala ATC that
they were overhead Agartala VOR even though the aircraft
was nowhere near Agartala VOR.
22)
The flight crew commenced descent nearly 10 minutes before
the top of descent prescribed in the operational flight plan
without realising that the same would result in a change of
Estimated Time of Arrival.
23)
The flight crew requested Imphal ATC for setting course
directly outbound for ILS let down, which was cleared by the
ATC. This was procedurally a wrong call-out by the flight
crew. Permission by the Air Traffic Controller for direct
outbound could not possibly have misled the pilot not to
come overhead VOR.
187

24) The flight crew gave wrong altitude call-outs to Imphal ATC
on a number of occasions during descent and let down
which can only be termed as an act of indiscipline.
25) The aircraft never came overhead Imphal VOR even though
the ATC had asked it to report overhead.
26) The flight crew reported approaching overhead VOR even
though the aircraft was about 14 miles away from Imphal
VOR at that point of time.
27) The flight crew had initially intimated to Imphal ATC the
estimated time of arrival as 07:16 hours UTC. However,
after setting course directly to Imphal from Comilla they
revised their ETA to 07:12 hours UTC.
28) The possibility of the flight crew being misled by reason of
false indication of the VOR is ruled out.
29) The flight crew by virtue of not reporting overhead VOR and
turning right much shorter of the same, instead of turning
left overhead VOR for tear drop entry, lost the time reference
required for carrying out ILS let down.
30)
Till the time of impact the aircraft was not on localizer or
glide path.
31)
There was total lack of discipline and professionalism during
the flight on the part of the flight crew by not adhering to the
operational flight plan as also the ILS let down chart together
with wrong position reports and altitude call-outs.
32)
The Pilot-in-Command did not adhere to the ILS let down
chart but instead seems to have relied upon the ground
features with which he thought he was extremely familiar.

33)
The flight crew committed a grave error of not realising that
early commencement of descent to 10,000 feet and turn to
right without coming overhead VOR would misplace them in
the hilly terrain further away from the airport.
34)
No emergency condition was communicated by the flight
crew during the entire course of flight till the time of impact.
35) The co-pilot throughout the flight remained as a mere
passive and mute spectator to the deviations from the
prescribed operational procedures.
36)
Tail wind of even 60 knots during outbound leg could not
have drifted the aircraft to the place where the crash has
taken place if the ILS let down procedure was adhered to.
37)
About six seconds prior to the impact, GPWS warning carne
'ON', but it was not possible to clear the hill ahead even if
the crew had taken immediate action to climb.
38)
The crash occurred on the Thangjing Hill about 300 feet
below the hill peak and at a distance of 20.19 nautical miles
from VOR Imphal Airport as per the distance estimate given
by the Directorate of Survey (Air).
39)
There was no evidence to indicate any sabotage or inflight
structural failure of the aircraft.
40)
Search and rescue operations were carried out in a manner
as is expected in the circumstances as were prevalent on the
date of the accident at crash site.
189

16. PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT
The accident occurred by reason of a grave error on the part
of the Pilot-in-Command in not adhering to the operational flight
plan and ILS let down chart and not realising that his early de-
scent to 10,000 feet and turning right for outbound leg without
reporting overhead VOR would result in loss of time reference and
as such misplace him in the hilly terrain. The Pilot-in-Command's
action may have been influenced by his extreme familiarity with
the terrain.
190

17• RECOMMENDATIONS
1)
The Indian Airlines should reiterate to all its pilots that they
must meticulously follow all stipulated operational proce-
dures.
2)
The Flight Safety Directorate of Indian Airlines should be
restructured so as to introduce a flight standardisation cell
which would be responsible for surveillance checks on board
the aircraft as also simulator training and monitoring of
other related operational aspects. This should, however, be
in addition to the routine proficiency checks as is prevalent.
3)
The operator should carry out random checks of Cockpit
Voice Recorder, Flight Data Recorder and Digital Flight Data
Recorder and the DGCA should ensure compliance thereof
4)
The training progranune of the operator ought to inculcate a
sense of cockpit discipline amongst the pilots in order to
ensure smooth and efficient operation of the flight with
meticulous observance of stipulated procedures.
5)
Indian Airlines training progranune should emphasise the
need for correct call-outs by pilots and under no circum-
stances the pilot should indulge in wrong and inappropriate
call-outs.
6)
The Indian Airlines training programme ought to provide
that the pilots should be guided by available navigational
aids rather than the visual ground fixes specially on an IFR
night.
7)(cid:9)
Indian Airlines should include an exercise in the syllabus for
simulator training as regards the pilot's reaction to the trig-
gering of the GPWS.
191

8)
Co-pilots training ought to match with that of the Pilot-in-
Command since the former is acting as a safety pilot and
may be required to take charge should it be so required.
9)
The operator ought to hold flight safety meetings regularly
and the entire Directorate of the operator requires restruc-
turing and revamping so as to be more effective in the matter
of flight safety.
10) Periodic meetings between the Operations Manager, Flight
Safety, and the Line Pilots ought to be arranged so as to
derive benefit from the experiences of other pilots.
11)
Proper liaison be maintained between the Flight Despatch,
Operational Personnel including engineering and the Flight
Safety Directorate of the operator by way of meetings at
regular intervals.
12) The career pattern of pilots as is existing today with the
operator (Indian Airlines) ought to be reviewed in the light of
observations made in the report.
13) The operator through their training programme ought to en-
courage and impress on junior pilots and convince them that
they not only have the right but indeed have the responsibili-
ty to speak up if they disagree with senior pilot's action.
They must be reassured. that they will not suffer displeasure
or recrimination for doing so.
14)
The senior pilots must equally be told that if they do not
accept or indeed ridicule a junior pilot's actions in this
regard then their own behaviour is unacceptable to the air-
line.
15)
The operator must inculcate in the whole body of the pilots
the philosophy of team work while operating a flight.
192

16) Cockpit Resource Management Course ought to be intro
duced without any further loss of time and if necessary even
an outside management consultant may be approached for
proper and effective guidance in regard theketo and all pilots
are to undergo the same course in order to promote better
cockpit management for safe flight operations.
17)
The cabin crew training programme should be standardised
and no departure from the prescribed training syllabus
ought to be permitted.
18)
The operator should ensure that all mandatory documents
are upto date and carried on board. The DGCA Airworthi-
ness Officers should carry out random checks and monitor
compliance of the same.
19) All Boeing 737 Aircraft operating in the country and regis-
tered by the Director General of Civil Aviation should be
fitted with Digital Flight Data Recorder as also Emergency
Locator Transmitters capable of impact as well as water
activation.
20) Calcutta Airport being a major Boeing 737 aircraft mainte-
nance base, ought to be provided with all necessary spares
and trained personnel for effecting proper checks upto
Check-I level so as to avoid carrying forward of any snag and
for other similar stations the situation ought to be reviewed
forthwith.
21) Proficiency checks of Air Traffic Controllers should be carried
out periodically at least once a year and the Air Traffic
Controllers should also undergo refresher courses once a
year.

22)
The performance of the ATCOs ought to be monitored regu-
larly by the National Airports Authority and all remedial
measures be taken immediately and if required further train-
ing be arranged for without any financial repercussions.
23)
Periodic monitoring of ATC tape so as to check the proficien-
cy of ATCOs should be conducted by the National Airports
Authority and the DGCA should also monitor the same by
way of random checks.
24)
The National Airports Authority should arrange for familiari-
sation flights for all ATC personnel more frequently in con-
sultation with the operators operating in the country.
25)
Periodic medical check-ups of ATCOs ought to be introduced
immediately.
26)
National Airports Authority should envisage specific duty
hours for the ATCOs taking into consideration the fatigue
factor.
27)
The training programme of ATCOs ought to contain a sylla-
bus through which the ATCOs can familiarise themselves
with the cockpit instruments relating to navigational and
ground aid facilities.
28)
National Airports Authority should carry out calibration of all
navigational and landing aids at the frequency stipulated by
ICAO.
29)
National Airports Authority should ensure that only trained
and formally rated Air Traffic Controllers handle the traffic.
30) National Airports Authority should clearly lay down the
duties and responsibilities of Aerodrome Assistants and Air
Traffic Control Officers.
194

31)
Search and rescue ought to be included in the syllabus for
training of appropriate personnel by the National Airports.
Authority.
32) Status indicator lights ought to be maintained in serviceable
condition at all times in all airports without any differentia-
tion.
33)
Locator beacons at ILS markers may be provided at Imphal
airport and also at other hilly terrain airports.
34)
ATC tape recorder ought to be provided at Imphal Airport
without any further loss of time. As a
-matter of fact, this
particular facility should be made available to all airports
having scheduled Airline operations.
35)
The National Airports Authority would be well-advised to
prepare periodic maintenance schedules for all navigational,
conununication and landing aids and safety services. Period-
ic checks be carried by only trained personnel.
36)
As far as practicable there should be two Air Traffic Control..
lers available at the Control Tower during the flight move-
ments at least at stations where all ATC functions are
combined in one unit as also at the Area and Approach
Control Units where radar facility is available.
37)
The National Airports Authority must make available the in-
strument let down charts to the DGCA for its approval.
38)
Instrument let down charts of airports specially in the hilly
terrain ought to be reviewed by National Airports Authority
in consultation with the operator and seek the approval of
DGCA.

39) Necessary equipment should be installed by the Meteorologi-
cal Department for assessment of runway visual range as
also cloud base at Imphal Airport as also other airports in
hilly terrain.
40) The Flight Inspection Directorate of DGCA should be restruc-
tured to carry out frequent proficiency checks of the airline
pilots on various types of aircraft and the ATCOs.
41) The Air Safety Directorate or DGCA should be strengthened
to make it more effective in discharge of its vital functions
relating to safety of aircraft operations.
42) The one man Accident Prevention Cell-currently existing in
DGCA is totally inadequate to discharge the vital role of
accident prevention and as such it should be restructured
and strengthened without any loss of further time.
43) DGCA should have an separate air accident prevention cell
manned by persons not below the rank of Senior Air Safety
Officer at every major airport of the country.
44) The implementation of the earlier recoimnendation in regard
to licensing of ATCOs and Aerodromes should be effected
forthwith by creating an adequately staffed new wing in the
Office of the Director General of Civil Aviation.
45) The DGCA should ensure inspection of the aerodromes at
. least once in two years.
46) DGCA should coordinate meetings with the Operators and
the National Airports Authority in regard to Flight Safety
inclusive of engineering aspects.
47) The DGCA being the regulatory authority ought to be re-
vamped so as to be able to discharge its regulatory functions
196

in terms of the Aircraft Act and the Rules framed thereunder
effectively.
48)
Director of Airworthiness of DGCA should exercise strict
supervision by carrying out more frequent spot checks for
better quality control in all relevant areas.
49)
The DGCA ought to review the Minimum Equipment List
periodically and monitor its usage particularly in regard to
snag detection within a period of one hour prior to the depar-
ture.
50)
The Central Government would be well advised for formation
of an independent Air Safety Board as discussed in the
report.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
Before closing this report my sincere thanks go to the Asses-
sors Shri B.P. Baliga, Retd. Director of Engineering, Air India and
Wg. Cdr. P. Ashoka, a very renowned test pilot of the country for
their valuable assistance in this matter. It has been a real pleas-
ure to be associated with such eminent persons in the aviation
industry of the country.
Before I record my appreciation to the Indian officials, my
sincere thanks go to the Civil Aviation Authority, Australia and to
Qantas Airways as also to the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore.
The manner in which both the above noted authorities and the
Airline assisted me, is something to be remembered for long time to
come. I do not feel shy to record that Qantas culture has opened a
new vista in my knowledge of aviation and I hereby record my
appreciation therefor. My sincere thanks go to Maurie Baston,
Tony Allison, Mick Vaughan and Ronald J Yates of the Civil Avia-
tion Authority, Australia. I am indeed happy to have met Capt.
John Faulkner, Manager Flight Safety, Qantas Airways more so by
reason of his untiring effort in coordinating the whole programme
of study of the Qantas culture and I record my sincere thanks to
John for the same. My thanks also go to Capt. Ray Heiniger,
Deputy Chief Pilot; Ken S. Lewis, Head of Safety; Kerry F. Lums-
don, Quality Assurance Controller; R.W. Alcorn, Manager of Air-
craft Engineering and David Cormack, Manager Operations Train-
ing Services. The hospitality of both the CAA Australia and Qantas
knew no bounds and in this context my sincere thanks also go to
the Deputy Chief Executive, Qantas Airways.
I record with appreciation the sincere help and assistance
given to me by the Singapore Civil Aviation Authority, in particular
Chan Mun Por, Head (Airworthiness Licensing); Chew Ah Leng,
Flight Operations Inspector; Chan Wing Keong, Head (Airworthi-
ness and flight Operations); and Ho See Hai, Higher Airworthiness
Surveyor.
198

I also thank the Acting Consul General of India at Sydney
Shri Dingliana for his assistance in every sphere at Sydney and his
active interest in regard to safety of Indian Civil Aviation Industry.
I also record my sincere thanks to Shri Ratan Ghosh, Manager, Air
India, Sydney and Shri S. Ranganathan, Regional Accounts
Manager, Air India, Sydney, for their definite assistance whilst I
was at Sydney.
The sincerity with which the manufacturer of the aircraft,
namely, Boeing Company responded to the queries of this Court of
Inquiry needs special praise. The Company never showed any
reluctance to assist the Court in every sphere. Special representa-
tives were sent to meet me both at Delhi and at Calcutta and the
exercises undertaken at the request of the Court cannot but be
praiseworthy. Mr. James Kerrigan an Aeronautical Engineer was
specially flown from USA to Calcutta for the purpose of assisting
this Court of Inquiry by his oral evidence and documentary presen-
tation before the Court. I record my appreciation to the Company
for such assistance.
Capt. D.S. Mathur, Director Operations, Air India, and Capt.
J.R. Trilokekar, Deputy Director Operations, Air India, were trou-
bled by me on more than one occasion, but their sense of duty and
sincerity for the purpose prompted them to bear with me ungrudg-
ingly and I record my appreciation and sincere thanks for their
invaluable service to this Court of Inquiry specially for taking the
trouble of simulating the flight path on the basis of the flight data
of the ill-fated aircraft and other flight datas on more than one
occasion.
During the course of investigation, I came to know Shri H.S.
Khola, Deputy Director General of Civil Aviation more closely and
in him I find an efficient, knowledgeable, devoted and hard-
working official of the Central Govermnent. I sincerely wish him all
success in life and pray to Almighty that Shri Khola should con-
tinue to act with such devotion for all times to come.
199

I will fail in my duty if I do not mention the untiring effort of
Shri Satendra Singh, Director Air Safety in the Office of the Direc-
tor General of Civil Aviation. In him I find an ever-obliging gentle-
man who is not only hard-working but sincere to its core and I also
wish him all success in life.
Shri R.K. Paul, Regional Controller of Air Safety, Calcutta,
and the Inspector of Accident in this case has left a very deep
impression in my mind for his sincerity and hard-work together
with his desire to fulfil all the needs of the Court. Shri Paul has
helped me to an enormous extent to bring to a fruitful end of the
task assigned to me. The report submitted by him is also very
comprehensive and assisted me in every sphere of my inquiry.
Shri A.K. Sinha, the Secretary of this Court of Inquiry has
also been of very great assistance to me. Troubled as lie was
during the entire course of Inquiry, he never lost his patience. His
profound knowledge of Air Traffic Control System has also left a
deep impression in my mind.
In the body of the report I did mention about the effort of
Manipur Adventure and Allied Sports Institute (MAASI), in the
matter of search and rescue. I sincerely hope and pray to Ahnighty
that Shri N.J.K. Singh along with his young friends should contin-
ue to render this type of invaluable humane service and I wish the
organisation all success.
My sincere thanks also go to the Border Security Force
personnel as also the personnel of Manipur Rifles and Central
Reserve Police Force, without whose assistance the search and
rescue would have been a near impossibility. I alsO record my
sincere appreciation of the services rendered by the Indian Air
force in providing all necessary assistance including helicopters for
rescue work as also for location of the crash site to this Court of
Inquiry.
200

My thanks also go to the staff of the West Bengal Legislative
Assembly as also the staff of the Manipur Government Circuit
House at Iniphal for all their administrative assistance and courte-
sies extended to me and to the other members of this Court of
Inquiry.
I will be failing in my duty if I do not record my sincere
appreciation of the services rendered by Shri Lalit Gupta and Shri
R.K. Kohli in the Office of the Director General of Civil Aviation,
without whose assistance this report could not have been prepared
within the target date. The untiring energy of these two young
gentlemen needs special mention and praise.
While I thank all the lalAyers who have assisted the Court in
Its Inquiry, I record my special appreciation for the assistance
renderecrby Capt. S.L. Bagehi, Capt. Mulherkar, Shri K.K. Saxena
and Shri Dasgupta for, their invaluable service to this Court of
Inquiry. I must also record my very great appreciation to Mr. Roy
Choudliury being the father of Late Capt. D.B. Roy Choudhury for
his assistance to this Court of Inquiry in the matter of identifica-
tion of voice. Mr. Roy Choudliury, grief-stricken as he was by
reason of the loss of his son, did come forward to assist the Court -
an indeed laudable gesture.
Finally my deepest condolences to the members of the be-
reaved families both of crew and of the passengers.
