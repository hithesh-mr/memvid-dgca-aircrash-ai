1. PACTUAL INFORMATION ;
1.1. History of the Flight :

National Remote Sensing Agency airorafl VI'-EQM had departed
from Ahmedabad at 0501 UTC. At the time of take off the aircraft
was carrying fuel on board for 0500 hrs. endurance. There were 4
occupants in the aircraft including the Commander. The commander

i was occupying the left hand seat in the cockpit and the right
hand seat in the cockpit was occupied by Sq.Ldr. (Retd)
f P. Dastidar, Navigator in NRSA. The other two occupants on board
the aircraft were Shri N.V.Anjaneyulu, AME and Shri S. Panda,
; Aircraft Technician.
At Ahmedabad a flight plan for IFR flight was filed by the
| Commander indicating departure as 0430 UTC and EET (Estimated
Elapsed time) as 0115 hrs. The Communication, Meteorological and
ATC briefings were obtained by the Commander. The route to be
followed by the aircraft was W138 at FL 100/95.

The aircraft actual departure from Ahmedabad runway 23 was
at 0501 UTC and thereafter the aircraft climbed initially to FL
100/95 on route to Bhavnagar for Bombay. Subsequently at 0511

UTC the aircraft was cleared by Ahmedabad ATC to climb to FL

200/190. The route estimates passed by the aircraft to Ahmedabad
ATC were Bhavnagar at 0525, RP BOWFIN at 0550, and destination
Bombay at 0630 UTC.

The aircraft came in first contact with Bombay ATC on Area
Control frequency (125.9 MHz) at 0526 UTC when the aircraft was
maintaining FL 190. The aircraft was descended subsequently in
stages to FL 150 and FL 140 during its contact with Area Control
Centre. The aircraft reported to Area Control] its estimate over
Bombay VOR as 0615 UTC.

| At 12 DME from Bombay the aircraft was changed over from
Area Control Centre to Approach Control and at 11 DME maintaining
FL 140, the aircraft contacted Approach Control (127.9 MHz) at
0613 uUTc. The aircraft wag initially given. heading 180° for
identification on the Radar and was also given descend clearance
to FL 120. It was given further descend to FL 100. At 0614 UTC
the aircraft was again asked by the Radar Controller to steer
left heading 090 for identification. At 0616 UTC Approach
confirmed to the aircraft of having identified it at 5 NM NNE of
Bombay airport.

After having identified ,the aircraft was asked to continue
heading 090 and descend to FL 070. Thereafter the aircraft was
given descend to transition level 55 when the aircraft reported
its level as 090. At 0619 UTC the aircraft reported FL 55 and at
0620 utc the aircraft was asked to turn right heading 190. At
0621 UTC the aircraft was given further vectoring for heading 240
and intercept the localizer from the right. This instruction
was acknowledged by the aircraft. At this stage the aircraft was
18 miles from touch down. '

d 2

j At 0622 UTC the aircraft was permitted to descend by Bombay
Radar to 3700 ft on QNH 1001 HPa and was asked to report leaving
: FL 55. At this stage the aircraft confirmed leaving level 55.

Soon thereafter at 0623 UTC the aircraft was asked by the
Radar itw level when the aircraft reported at 4000 ft. This was
the last tranamission from the aircraft to the ATC. At 0629 UTc
at the query from Tower regarding the distance of aircraft the
Radar Controller could not locate the aircraft on the screen and
that the aircraft should be touching down.

When the calls subsequently from both Tower as well as’ the
Approach Controllers to the aircraft VT-EQM was not responded, an
alarm was raised by the Bombay Tower Controller, who enquired
from the following aircraft whether they have sighted any
aircraft on the approach path ahead of them. Thereafter when the
aircraft failed to land after its expected time at 0630 UTC of
its arrival on Runway 27, full emergency was declared at Bombay
airport and search & rescue operations were initiated,

The aircraft wreckage was located around 1230 UTC by an
Indian Navy helicopter engaged in the search operation on the

; hills on the approach path of runway 27 at a distance of about 11
NM from Bombay.

The aircraft had crashed on the hill top lying in its flight
path at 11 NM from Bombay Airport just before reaching the Outer
Marker. The height at which the aircraft impacted the hill top
was 1170 ft. AMSL. The accident occurred during day light hours
at approx. time 0625 UTC (1155 IST).

y Capt.V.Ramakrishna,for renewal of his SCPL, had under-
gone his last medical examination at the Air Force CME ,New Delhi
on the 25th June, 1993, and was declared Fit by the Board. This
Wa also endorsed by the ADGMS of the DGCA on the 28th June,

Scrutiny of flying training records of Capt.
V.Ramakrishna reveals that for the endorsement of SKA 300 type
aircraft on his CPL, the Manager Aircraft Operations of NRSA_ had
applied to the DGCA on 11th June, 1992 , stating that considering
180 hrs PIC experience on SKA B200, the training on SKA 300 type
aircraft of Capt Ramakrishna by a DGCA nominated  Instructor/
Examiner was not carried out. However, the DGCA nominated
instructor Capt Srivastava, had carried out dual instructions
flying on SKA 300 type aircraft. Accordingly the SKA 300 type

| endorsement had been entered in his CPL for PIC rating on 15

_i dune, 1992. Subsequently, on 15 April, 1993, NRSA had applied for
issue of SCPL to Capt. Ramakrishna in which the Skill test by day
and by night was carried out on SKA B-200 type aircraft.
Thereafter the SCPL 969 was issued to Capt «Ramakrishna with PIC
rating on Pushpak, SKA B-200 and SKA 300 type aircraft and
Co-pilot rating on Dc-3 type aircraft.

‘ The summary of flying record of Capt. V.Ramakrishna for

; the period December 1991 to May 1992 submitted to the DGCA

i reveals that on SKA 300 type aircraft he had undergone 03:20 hrs |
: 4

dual inatructional flying by day which includes flying on 30
April, 1992 for 01:05 hrs as proficiency endorsement test and
0:50 hra as Instrument Rating Check . This summary record also
indicates 07:35 hrs of instructional flying by night which
includes one hour of check for endorsement . The Check Reports
indicate Standard proficiency. At the time of issue of SCPL 969
in April,1993 Capt Ramakrishna, had 02:00 hra experience as
co-pilot, 01:30 hrs as PIC by day and 02:00 hrs PIC by night
current on SKA 300 type aircraft. He had no Instrument Flying
during the above period.

Between the period 11 April, 1993 and 25 June 1993,
records indicate that Capt Ramakrishna had flown SKA 300 aircraft
for 13:05 hrs and has 02:00 hrs Instrument flying on type. In the
month of July, 1993, the aircraft had flown for 03:15 hra for
Ahmedabad task and was flown by Capt Ramakrishna as PIC.

1.6. Aircraft Information ;:

Super King Air 300 aircraft VT-EQM owned and operated
by National Remote Sensing Agency, Hyderabad, had a Certificate
of Registration No. 2432,in Catg. A, issued by the DGCA on the
25th July, 1989. The aircraft was issued with a Certificate of
Airworthiness (C of A) No. 1925 under the Normal Category, Sub-
Division Aerial Work. The aircraft manufactured in 1987 had been
allotted S.No. FA 126 by its Manufacturer the Beech Aircraft
Corporation at Wichita , Kansas, USA. According to its C of A
only one crew is necessary to operate the aircraft and its all up
weight has been authorised upto 5700 kgs. The C of A on the
aircraft was valid upto the 28th December, 1993.

The Super King Air 300 is a low wing retractable under-
Carriage type construction with semi-monocoque fuselage design
with the cabin & cockpit pressurised. The tail Plane & elevator
are mounted on the rudder top. The aircraft is powered by two PT-
6 turbo prop engines driving 4 bladed propellers.

The aircraft was modified after being delivered in
India which consisted of installation of a camera well with
door . The camera installation was adjacent to the airstair door.
Aft of the camera installation, the aircraft had installation of
a forward looking infrared camera requiring a two feet diameter
hole in the fuselage. In the centre fuselage belly the aircraft
had provision of installation of a 360° terrain mapping radar
with the fuselage structure having an opening of appxm. 4 feet x

\ 4 feet cut in the fuselage. A radome is installed over the radar
antenna. In the accident aircraft the radome waa installed over

1 the opening. According to NRSA, the special mission equipments

j were removed at Ahmedabad prior to the accident flight.

The aircraft had logged 270:24 hours of flying since
new and 27:04 hours of flying since last C of A renewal on the

28 December, 1992. Both the engine propellers had done 28:54
hours till the 14th July, 1993. The last c Of A renewal checks

Were carried out at the Indamer Co, (P) Ltd. Juhu , Bombay and at

: 5

that time no mandatory modifications/ inspections on the aircraft

were outstanding. Subsequent to the C of A renewal,the last major

inwpection (200 hre/6 months) schedule was carried out on the

aircraft on 17 June, 1993, by Airworks India, Bombay.
' Prior to commencement of the flight from Ahmedabad, the
i aircraft was fuelled by India Oil Corporation at Ahmedabad air-
F port,with Jet A-1 fuel and the quantity uplifted was 610 litres
| at 0800 hrs IST. The AME Shri N.V.Anjaneyulu who subsequent ly
| boarded the flight had signed the IoC delivery receipt. The
/ Quality Control Test of the fuel batch used for the fuelling,
i i.e. No. JET/A-1/10C/TSM/12/15/AD-1/66 , was carried out by IOC
| Ahmedabad soon after the accident which revealed that the fuel
} uplifted meets the specifications. The test report of the fuel

sample also obtained from the DRD, Technical Centre corraborates
that the fuel uplifted at Ahmedabad passes the Quality Control
j tests as specified in D.Eng-RD No.2494 Issue No.10/ISI 1571-1992.
j 1.7. Meteorological information :

1.7.1 Prior to the departure on the accident flight from
| Ahmedabad the pilot of VT-EQM was given Met. briefing in an oral
/ manner by the Meteorological office at Ahmedabad. The briefing
| notes of the Ahmedabad Met. office and briefing register reveal
} that the pilot was briefed at 0330 UTC about the winds at FL 030,

050 and 070 as 290/30, 270/30, and 290/35 respectively. There was

also briefing about scattered clouds at 800 ft.,1800 ft. and
broken clouds at 8000 ft. The pilot Capt Ramakrishna had signed

the briefing register as acknowledgement of receiving the above
briefing and the documentation. According to the Director in

Charge India Meteorological Deptt. at Bombay, the Commander of

the aircraft VT-EQM reported to the MET office at Ahmedabad at

0330 UTC without filing any prior requisition for flight fore-

cast. Since he was in a hurry he requested for oral briefing

which was provided. Flight Forecast was therefore not provided at

Ahmedabad prior to the departure of the flight.

On the day of departure of the accident flight, the

Ahmedabad Meteorological Centre had issued Local Forecast at 0100

UTC valid for the airfield and 50 NM around and for the time

period 0100 to 0600 UTC of 15th July, 1993. The surface winds

were 270/8 kta with upper winds as follows:
3000 M 300/25 kts
2100 M 270/30 kts
1500 M 270/35 kts
900 M 270/30 kts.
The visibility indicated was 6 km with forecast for

Tempo 2000 M in Haze.

The Terminal Area Forecast (TAFOR) issued on the 15th
ees 1203) at 0300 UTC had indicated Rain showers and scattered
6

' 1.7-2 The Met. report issued at time 0610 UTC by the Met
Office at Bombay airport and which was valid at the time of the
; accident, indicate winds as 280/06 kts, gusting upto 16 kts.
4 visibility 3000 metres in feeble rain with scattered and broken
j clouds at 1000 ft & 2000 ft with overcast at 8000 ft and QNH ax
1001 HPa. The trend weather reported in the said Met. report was
; TEMPO visibility 1500 Metres in MOD SHRA.
The Local Forecast for Bombay and 50 NM around valid
from 0600 UTC to 1400 UTC on the 15th July, 1993,issued by the
: Meteorological Office ,Bombay Airport indicates surface winds as
240/10 kts gusting to 22 kts becoming 1314 240/12 kts. The
4 forecast weather includea Tempo at 0614 Rain Showers; the
j Visibility 5000 M tempo reducing to 1500 M in rain showers;
Clouds scattered at 450 M, 750 M with SCT CBs at 900 M.
1.7.3 Since no direct information/ document regarding weather
prevailing over the crash site at Taloja Hills iw available at
4 the India Meteorological Office at Bombay, therefore, the weather
observations was obtained from some of the crew who had landed
|, just prior to the accidented aircraft and who landed thereafter
i using the same runway and ILS facility during the final approach.
| The salient observations are as follows :
,
| The Commander of Bangla Desh Biman whose flight was to land
j after the accidented aircraft had stated of experiencing cloudy
weather with overcast accompanied by rain which was occasionally
heavy when nearing Bombay. Light turbulence becoming moderate
when thru heavy rain. The approach on ILS was made in total IMC
: and light turbulence and at 500-700 feet became visual. There was
no appreciable wind shear.
A Beech-99 commander flying his aircraft into Bombay from
j Pune had stated of intercepting the localiser at 12 NM ILS DME
in clouds and experiencing moderate turbulence with no _ rains.
The ILS approach including Glide slope capture was in clouds
with moderate turbulence and no rains. After breaking thru clouds
i at 1500 ft at about 4NM on ILS DME the flight was conducted in
clear weather.
The Commander of a B-737-300 coming into Bombay from Delhi
had stated that weather after interception’ of localiser was
Monsoonic with heavy rains and strong winds. There was turbulence
before the 0O.M. and there was heavy build ups in the approach
funnel.
A F-27 Commander flying into Bombay from Bhopal has
indicated the weather on the approach as cloudy, rainy and
. turbulent.
: d Another B-737 Commander had stated that there was no
Significant wind shear though the approach path was covered with
Clouds. He could break clouds at about 500ft on RA and an amount
of rain patch was experienced by him.
a
|

The Commander of a small private jet has described - the
presence of severe CB overhead the VOR and during the inbound of
the ILS having experienced rain and light turbulence. The

: movement of the weather was towards the easterly direction.

; From the above Pilots observation reports and also the Local
: Forecast of Bombay airport valid for 50 NM around the airfield it
i can be inferred that the accidented aircraft during its approach

on the ILS was in IMC conditions experiencing turbulence and

; rains. There ia no evidence of wind shear in the approach path.
1.8. Aids to Navigation :

4 The accident aircraft had its destination as Bombay
: airport. The following navigational aids were available at the
; airport during the subject accident flight:

NDB (265 KHz) DVOR (116.6 MHz) LOC (110.3 MHz) GLIDE
Slope (335 MHz) ILS DME ( 1001/1064 MHz)

Outer Locator (225 KHz) Middle Locator (201 KHz)

The aircraft was being vectored by the Approach Controller
on the Radar for ILS approach runway 27. According to the

: procedure for ILS approach at Bombay airport the aircraft are

d required to establish on the ILS at 3700 ft. and thereafter
descend on Glide slope to cross Outer Marker at a height of 2910

| ft. on the QNH.

,

,

| Since the aircraft wreckage was located on the slopes of

j hill near the outer marker at a height much below the height

E aircraft was cleared to and below the height aircraft is required

i to maintain while on ILS, therefore the serviceability status of
the relevant navigational aids are examined, for the preceeding 7

} days from the date of accident, as evident from the log~books,

; which are as follows :-

VOR/LOC/GP

| 10 July,1993 ; Battery Charger of OM attended; % of

modulation adjusted to 95.

| 12 July, 1993

to 15 July,1993 : VOR/DME on NOTAM due equipment problem.

15 July, 1993 : ILS/DME on CQ from 0910 to 1005 due coding

| motor problem.

Subsequent to the accident , the VOR/DME was on CQ from
0835 to 1050 UTC on 16th July,1993 due equipment problem. Also
On the 17 July, 1993, at the Outer Marker, new battery and bat-
tery charger waa installed and the facility was on CQ from 0905
to 1030 UTC. The Glide Path was on CQ from 1320 to 1815 UTC due
monitor problem and the Middle Marker/locator waa on CQ from 0835
to 1125 uTc due power supply breakdown. On the subsequent date

8

j-@ 18 July, 1993 the Middle Markat/ logatar was an CQ Cram 0520
to 0618 UTC due no power supply and on the 19th-20th July, the
Outer Marker was on Aerial Maintenance and CQ withdrawn at 1325
uTC on 20 July,1993.

Aircraft which have landed prior to and after the accidented
aircraft on the same runway using the ILS facility had not made
any complaints about the performance of the navigational
equipments. However, the records would reveal that prior to and
after the accident date of 15th July, 1993, the performance of
the navigational aids at Bombay airport had intermittent prob~

| lems.

Against the above performance data of the VOR/LOC/ GP, the
Pilot Reports for the last 15 days preceeding the accident was
examined and it is revealed that during the said period only on
the 11th July, 1993, a pilot report was found and acted upon as
recorded :

"At 1500, one of the aircraft reported not getting OM.
Equipment on ground found working normal. Facility
checked and found following aircraft getting OM
normal."

Subsequent to the accident, the ILS-DME was reported on the
16th July, 1993 as not locking at 0530 UTC. Subsequently at 1550
UTC an aircraft (VWD) reported not getting Outer Marker. Again at
2200 UTC VOR-DME was reported as not locking. On the 17th July,
1993,at 0742 UTC and 0820 UTC aircraft had reported not getting
outer locator. On the subsequent date 18th July, 1993,at 0357 UTC
an aircraft (VWB) reported not getting outer marker and at 0638
UTC IC-176 also reported not getting outer marker. Again at 1030
UTC on the 18th July,1993, several aircraft reported not getting
outer marker. This was followed at 1602 UTC report by VDB of not
getting outer marker.

The Glide Path Inspection by the Calibration aircraft on
1.5.1993 i.e prior to the accident date had indicated in the
report satisfactory flyability on both the Glide Path
transmitters. The Outer Marker and Outer Locator are also
reported to have satisfactory signal strength.

Even though aircraft preceding and aircraft following the
accident aircraft on 15th July 1993, while landing on runway 27
using ILS facility had not made any specific complaints on ILS
equipment performance, yet maintenance records of the equipment
reveal frequent intermittent nature of problem soon after the
accident.

1.9. Communication ;
The aircraft was in contact with the Air Traffic
Control of Bombay on Area Control Frequency 125.9 MHz and the |
| Approach Control Frequency 127.9 MHz. The aircraft met with the
accident before coming in contact with the Tower frequency. The
9

4 aTC tape transcript does not reveal any difficulty in the
transmission /reception of communication between the aircraft and
the ATC. The last communication from the aircraft to the ATC was

i at time 0623 UTC when to the Approach Controller's query of |

5 level passing the aircraft reported, "We are 4000 ft." This

: transmission was acknowledged by ATC. The next call from the ATC

F to the aircraft was at 0630 UTC by the Approach controller which

} remained unanswered. There was no transmission from the aircraft

: to the ATC of it experiencing/declaring any inflight emergency.
1.10. Aerodrome Information :

4 The aircraft took off from Ahmedabad and was to land at

4 Bombay Airport. Bombay airport has two runways (09/27 & 14/32)
and the runway 27 was in use at the time during which the
aircraft met with the accident. Runway 27 has a total length of
11455 ft and is equipped with ILS with the Outer Marker located
at a distance of 8.1 NM ( about 15 kms) from the displaced runway

; threshold. The runway 27 has Precision Approach Catg II Lighting
system with high intensity edge, threshold, centreline and touch-

q down zone lights. The transition altitude for the Aerodrome is
4000 ft. The Minimum Holding Altitude over the VOR and also the
Minimum Sector Altitude for Bombay airport in the direction of

i approach of the accidented aircraft is 3700 ft.

: The airport is managed by IAAI and Cat.IX fire protection is
available to meet the aircraft emergencies. After the aircraft

4 VT-EQM lost contact with Bombay ATC, at first local standby and

q f then full emergency was declared to meet the aircraft emergency.

} } 1.11. Flight Recorders :

, The aircraft was fitted with a Fairchild A-100 Cockpit
Voice Recorder Unit S.No. 54190. The aircraft did not have any
Flight Data Recorder unit installed.

4 ; The CVR unit recovered from the wreckage did not have

: any fire marks. There was slight distortion of the case on the

: electronic section of the unit. There was no damage on the case
fection containing the tape, its mechanism and the heads. The
tape removed from the recorder unit did not have any damage and

; was in good condition. The tape was installed on a RACAL Recorder

k Play-back unit for preparing the transcript.

. j The tape transcript does not reveal any evidence of

: : inflight emergency or any abnormality experienced by the Pilot
Prior to the impact. At 11 DME and at FL 140 the aircraft estab-

; lished contact with Radar and was under radar vector thereafter.
The aircraft when identified was positioned at 5 NM NNE of Bombay

; and was asked to continue heading 090 and descent to FL 070.
f Subsequently the aircraft was told to maintain level 55. When it
; reported reaching that level, it was given right heading 240 to
; intercept localiser from the right. The last conversation on the
; CVR tape was the aircraft reporting it being at 4000 ft which the
: Radar acknowledged. There was no further recording on the tape.
: 10

The tape also does not contain evidence of any intra
: cockpit conversation between the Pilot and the other occupants on
; board. The tape transcript also does not reveal any monitoring of
; ATIS broadcast during the last 30 minutes of flight. Also the
tape transcript does not reveal any evidence of aircraft
i emergency being encountered in flight by the pilot.
i 1.12. Wreckage and Impact: information 3;
i |
j The aircraft inflight had impacted the rising terrain in a
| near level attitude and was destroyed by the impact, The wings
/ separated from the fuselage and were found at the initial impact
| point. The fuselage continued to travel uphill for approx.70 ft.
I before coming to rest. The empennage had separated from the
| fuselage and was positioned on top of the fuselage. Both engines
| 1 separated during initial impact. The LH engine was positioned
approx. 20 ft. uphill from the initial impact point. The initial
impact point altitude was 1170 ft. above mean sea level and the
aircraft heading was approx. 275°.

The left main wing exhibited impact damage to its leading
edge and the leading edge separated forward of the main aspar.
The left wing had broken at two locations viz. between the
aileron and outboard flap and between outboard and inboard flap.
The left outboard flap actuator measured 2" extended correspond-
ing to flaps being in up position. The left main gear was in the
retracted position. The left auxilliary fuel tank exhibited
discolouration due post impact fire. There is no evidence of
fire on the exterior of wing surface.

The right main wing positioned under the left wing also
exhibited impact damage to its leading edge. The wing had_ sepa-
rated from the main spar at the right wing attach point. This
Wing had broken in two sections between aileron and outboard
flap. The outboard section had damage from the leading edge toa
aft apar. The right outboard flap actuator measured 2" extended
which corresponds to flaps in the up position. The right main
landing gear was in the retracted position.

The aileron balance cable was attached to aileron bell
Cranks on both wings. The aileron control cable exhibited ten-
8ion overload failures.

; The fuselage had broken into several sections. The copilot
Seat exhibited forward bending to the support structure. The
Seat pan was bent aft. The lap belt remained intact and its
; inboard attach point exhibit overload failure.

The empennage sustained impact damage to the left horizontal
8tabilizer. The left and right elevator trim tab actuators
measured 1.75" extended which corresponds to about 5° tab down
Position, The rudder trim tab actuator measured 3" extended
Corresponding to 10° tab left position. Control continuity was
available from the rudder and elevator bell crank upto the cock-

11

pit control.

The left engine had evidence of very heavy impact damage
with its propeller shaft rotating axis displaced from the nominal
engine axis by approx. 50° from left to right and upwards from
horizontal by approx. 20°. Reduction gear box and accessory gear
box mounted accessories were broken from the casings and all
external oil, fuel, pneumatic lines and fire seals were bent. /
crushed and in some cases fractured. The propeller shaft flange
and reduction gear box front housing were fractured exposing a
portion of the propeller shaft thrust bearing and seal. Although
the accessories were separated by impact the accessory gear box
and engine oil tank were essentially intact and attached to the
gaw generator cane. The Fuel Control Unit though separated during
impact had remained with the engine attached by control cable and
px line. The engine starter, generator and fuel pump had also
separated.

The right engine also had evidence of heavy impact damage
with distortion of flanges and the power turbine containment rig.
The rotational axis of the reduction gear box was upset from the
nominal engine rotation axis by appx.12* suggenting an impact
upon the nose section on the outboard side. Power turbine
governor remained attached to the reduction gear box with the
propeller governor missing. A portion of the gear box housing
from 9 O'Clock to 11 O'Clock had broken off. All accessory gear
box accessories were separated and all oil, fuel, pneumatic lines
and fire seals were crushed, bent and in some cases fractured and
torn.

The instrument panel and cockpit pedastal examination
of available instruments and lever etc position revealed :

(i) Pilot and copilot HSI indicated heading of 275°

(ii) Altimeter indicated 1160 with pressure set to 29.63"

and 1003 mb. ;

(iii)The left propeller rpm indicator needle was at O with

engine percent indicating 50% and No.2 engine perSnt
power indicating 72%.

(iv) Pilot and copilot RMI indicating heading of 275°.

(v) The pilot HSI had heading and glide slope flag visible

with course needle at 360°.

(vi) No.1 engine fuel flow indicated 150 pph.

(vii) Flap lever was in up position.

(viii) Landing gear control in up position.

(ix) Both engine condition levers at low idle stop.

(x) Pedestal had impact damage from the front forcing

throttle and propeller control aftward.

(xi) Copilot control wheel had both handles broken and had

a downward bend.
Both the engines retrieved from the site were strip
examined in association with the representatives of the engine

i
Manufacturer M/S P&W Canada. The detailed engine examination
has revealed that :
Both engines received severe impact damage particularly
| at their front ends where the reduction gear boxes and exhaust
| cases were broken and distorted. Both propeller shaft axes of
rotation were deflected inboard from the engine nominal rotation
| axes. Both engine reduction gear box trains were severed hetween
the propeller shafts and the second slage planet gear carriers.
: All other reduction gears were intact and had no evidence of pre-
impact distress. The power turbine blade damage and displacement
| ig consistent with impact force from the front to the rear,
| collision with static members and sudden stoppage. Both the
\ Compressor turbine disc and blade annemblies were heavily and
i continuously machined on Lheir front due contact with stabic
structure forced rearwards by impact from the front and casing
distortion. The Combustion equipment on both the engines was free
from pre-impact distortion and exhibited no signs of carbon
deposition or overtemperature colouration. Both the engine
compressors were free of foreign object damage or significant
erosion and the drives between the compressors and_ the
accessories gear boxes were continuous. Main oil and FCU filters
on both engines were free of contaminants. The rotating
propellers had sudden stoppage resulted in fracture of the left
engine propeller flange, separation of the right front reduction
gear box section and the severing of both engine propeller shafts
from their reduction gear boxes. The damage to both the
compressor turbine discs front faces resulted from the gas
‘ generators continued operation while in contact with downstream
static structures pushed rearward by impact, this operation
continuing till the fuel supply was available prior to
separation and fracture of fuel lines and control units. The |
engines were operating at power when impact occurred and the
propeller shaft torques at impact suggest power levels between
approach and cruise and propellex RPMs at some value less than
the maximun.
1.12.1 Explosive investigation :

The Bomb Detection & Disposal Squad (BDDS) Bombay of
the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security was pressed into service to
detect any possible traces of explosives in the aircraft wreckage
cad dead bodiea at the crash site itself. The BDDS team led by
Maj.V.L.dadhav and carrying their equipment reached the crash
site and the bodies therein on the 16th July, 1993. The BDDS
examination with their Electronic Explosive Vapour detector on
the wreckage and the bodies did not indicate any positive results |
for explosives. The wreckage which was concentrated in an area of
30 M x 5 M did not reveal any signs of pitting, vapourisation of
paints, fissured fragments ,»spiked fragments, curling, cupping
rolled edges etc. which are characteristic features associated
with explosion on board. The dead bodies did not have burnt marks
& splinter injuries neither any trace of parts used for bomb
mechanism such as detonator, wires, battery switch etc. could be

located at the wreckage.
}
In view of the above observations of the BDDS Squad, it
is inferred that the aircraft VT-EQM did not crash as a result of
| any explosives on board.
| 1.13. Medical & Pathological information :
| The Commander of the aircraft Capt.V.Ramakrishna had
| undergone his medical examination for renewal of his SCP at the
’ central Medical Establishment , New Delhi on the 25th June, 1993.
He was declared medically/surgically fit for renewal of his
' licence by the Board. The Board Findings were approved in the
| Final Assessment by ADGMS of DGCA on the 28th June, 1993. |
i) |
f The blood sample from the body of the dead Commander |
| could not be collected for tests to detect presence of alcohol,
if any, during the post mortem examination as blood could not be
found for collection. However , enquiries have indicated that the
rest house at Ahmedabad where the pilot had stayed the previous
y night do not permit/serve any form of alcoholic beverages.
q ‘
} 1.14. Fire =:
There was no fire at the crash site and on the main
; wreckage except that the left side auxilliary fuel tank had
| slight fire damage which is post impact.
There is no evidence on the aircraft wreckage and the
engines of any inflight fire.
1.15. Survival aspects :
| The aircraft in flight had impacted the rising terrain
| during the approach phase of flight with its wing flaps and the
retractable undercarriage in full retracted. condition. The
cockpit and the cabin section of the fuselage had completely
disintegrated with the nose and cockpit section having evidence
of straight in collision. The injuries suffered by the persons on
board are of severe crushing impact from the front.
The accident was non-survivable.
1.15.1 Post mortem reports :
The post mortem examination of the bodies of the per~-
s0ns receiving fatal injuries was carried out by a Government
| Medical Officer at the Panvel Principal Dispensary.
th All the bodies had ante-mortem multiple injuries and
€ upper front portion consisting of the head and face have been
smashed /received crushing injuries with loss of teeth and eyes.
14

fhe spinal chord in each case was also found having multiple
fractures.
4.16. Search & Rescue :
After the NRSA aircraft VT-EQM was lost by the Radar
Controller on his scope and also VHF contact could not. be
established by the Area Control with the aircraft, ATC Bombay
Airport declared full emergency and Bangladesh aircraft BO17
which was following VT-EQM in the approach sequence was advised
to go around. The NAA authorities at the Control] Tower advised
Air Works at the old airport to check whether VT-EQM had by
chance landed and parked there. Fire tenders of IAAI were sent
towards approach side of runway 27 with the advise to look for
the missing aircraft. Crash tenders equipped with RT were also
gent towards Ghatkopar and Thane creek which falls on _ the
approach path to _ look for the missing aircraft. The Police
station in the approach area Kurla, Ghatkopar, New Bombay, Thane
and Sion were telephonically informed about the missing aircraft
and advised to look for it. The IAF station at Juhu aerodrome
was requested to launch helicopter flight to proceed to the final
approach path of runway 27 to locate the missing aircraft. The
helicopter took off from Juhu at 0712 UTC. ATC deputed land
| parties at 0730 UTC equipped with walkie-talkies towards the
approach path of 27. The military authorities at Kalina provided
| 4 vehicle and military personnel at 0930 UTC which was
i accompanied by NAA personnel for the search. The Naval
/ authorities were also contacted by ATC to provide speed boats for
| searching in the Thane creek.
| The Air Force helicopter (call sign 04) which took off from
i Juhu carried out low level search from 0712 UTC to 0841 UTC and
I the missing aircraft was not located. The Navy also was request-
ed to launch their helicopter flight for search and rescue and at
1235 UTC Naval helicoplLer 438 commenced searching over the outer
| marker area. At 1340 UIC the Navy helicopter pilot confirmed on
| Approach frequency 127.9 MHz that the wreckage has been sighted
; and is looking for survivors. The position of the wreckage was
transmitted as 4 NM on heading 270 from Taloja village at height
; of about 1300 ft on the hill. After some time when no survivors
; could be located in the aerial search the helicopter returned
f back to ita base at 1408 UTC. The helicopter confirmed that it
/ could read the registration marking letters "QM".
Simultaneously at about the same time of receipt of mesnHage
from the helicopter of sighting the wreckage, the New Bombay
police control room informed ATC of the land party having located
/ the wreckage. In the early hours of 16.7.93, the Dy.Commissioner
of police, New Bombay informed ATC of his personnel reaching the
q Bite and observed four dead bodies. On 16.7.93 morning the
Wreckage site on the hill site was reached by the various
7 agencies for removal of the dead bodies and investigation
Purposes and retrieval of evidences.

2. ANALYSIS :
tn Lbias acer ident the aiverafl VEHPQM had impacted

inflight the rising terrain which was on its approach path. The
aircraft during an ILS approach on runway 27 is required to be at
a minimum height of 3700 ft. on QNH before intercepting the glide

' slope and be at 2910 ft. over the outer marker in its descend
profile. The accident site is prior to the outer marker location
and the height of the hill is 1328 ft. The aircraft had hit the
hill side at 1170 ft.

In view of the above the following factors are analysed
for determining the probable cause of the accident viz.

1. Engineering Factor
2. Pilot Factor
3. ATC Factor
2.1 Engineering Factor :
|
Prior to the accident flight, the aircraft had flown at
Ahmedabad on 2 days i.e. 12th and 14th July, 1993 for a total of
3 hours 15 minutes, During this period there was no_ snag
reported on the aircraft at Ahmedabad excepting pressurisation
i problem on the 12th July, 93. Prior to departure from Ahmedabad
on 15th July 93, engine ground run up was carried out for 20
minutes along with preflight checks and no snag was reported.
} The aircraft was fuelled at Ahmedabad and the fuel quality checks
] reveal that the uplifted fuel meet the specification. The fuel
quantity for the flight was also adequate as the endurance was
for 5 hours.

Subsequent to take off from Ahmedabad and also during

j approach to Bombay the communication between the aircraft and ATC

at Ahmedabad and Bombay reveals that the pilot had not declared

{ having experienced any inflight engineering problem. The Cockpit
Voice Recorder also does not reveal any evidence of inflight
emergency which the pilot would have discussed with the engineer
and/or other two technical persons also travelling on board the
aircraft.

Investigation at the wreckage site revealed that the
aircraft had contacted the hillside with flaps and undercarriage
in retracted position. All the four corners of the aeroplane
Were located at the crash site eliminating any possibility of
inflight structural disintegration and liberation prior to
impact, There is no evidence of inflight fire prior to the
impact. The aircraft was maintaining a near heading of 270°,
which is the approach heading for runway 27 and the HSI was

| indicating heading 275°, thereby indicating that the pilot was
able to fly the aircraft on the desired track. The continuity of
| the flying controls from the cockpit to the respective surfaces
were found at the wreckage. :

16

F |
|
There is no direct evidence to show that the airborne
equipment/cockpit indication pertaining to ILS had malfunctioned
during flight as the involved aircraft’ components have been
i destroyed due to impact in the crash.
Investigation of both engines revealed that the
| combustion equipment was free from pre-iinpact distortion,
exhibited no signs of carbon deposition and over temperature
colouration. Also the engine reduction gears did not reveal any
q evidence of pre-impact distress. The nature of damage to the
j engines. indicate that both power plants were operating at power
at the time of impact. The damage to the propeller shafts
suggests the propeller rpm of both engines were at some value
} less than the maximum at the time of impact.

In view of the above evidences it can be inferred that the
| aircraft inflight did not experience any engineering emergency
| that could have led the aircraft to descend to an altitude below
the minimum prescribed at that stage of the flight. The
i engineering factor as a direct and/or indirect cause of the
} accident is therefore, eliminated.

2.2. Pilot Factor :
In the instant: case, at the time of impact the aircraft
Wak under radar vecloring by Lhe Approach Controller. From the |
i recordings of the ATC tape corroborated by that of the CVR_ tape,
it is evident that the aircraft was descended in steps from FL
{ 140 when it first contacted Bombay Radar. At 0621 UTC timing of
the ATC tape transcript, the aircraft VT-EQM was told by radar to
turn right heading 240 and intercept localizer from right. The
aircraft was at level 55 at this stage. According to the CVR
tape, after about 1 minute of above transmission, the aircraft is
being asked by radar to descend to 3700 ft. on QNH 1001 and
report leaving 55. After reporting leaving 55, the aircraft
subsequently reported at 4000 ft after 51 seconds. This
indicates that the aircraft had descended from FL 55 at the rate
of approx 1800 ft. per minute when it passed through the level of
4000 ft. From the CVR and ATC tape there is no evidence that
the pilot after having told to intercept the localizer had
reported to ATC of intercepting the same at any time thereafter.
The wreckage site examination had revealed that the
aircraft heading was 270°. Also the location of the site is in
line with the extended runway 27 center line as evident from the
Jeppessen vicinity chart. Further more during the investigation
at site, it was observed that aircraft coming into land on runway
27 at Bombay airport directly passes over head the crash _ site
{ location. There is no direct evidence to indicate that the
aircraft had intercepted the localizer. However, in view of the
above inferences it can be stated that the aircraft’ which was
flying in Instrument Meteorological Conditions with low cloud
; base and rain, had in all probability, captured the localizer
beam to be in line with the runway 27.
17

The aircraft being on radar vector, was auked to
intercept the localizer. However, there is no evidence that the
aTC had advised the aircraft of ILS approach. In the ILS

j approach for runway 27 after having intercepted the localizer at

3700 ft. further descend is to be made following the glide slope
signal. In this procedure the aircraft would be at a height of
2910 ft. over the outer marker which is 8.1 NM from the displaced
runway threshold. Prior to the outer marker, therefore, the
aircraft following the glide slope signal would at a greater
height than 2910 ft. In the instant case, the aircraft had
impacted terrain prior to the outer marker location and at a
height much below the height at which an aircraft should be when
following the glide slope. This could be possible due either the
pilot not having the glide slope signal or failure to intercept.
the same. Other aircraft following the accidented aircraft for \
landing on runway 27 and those who had preceded the accident
aircraft had also executed ILS approach and no complaint wags
recorded by the crew of those flights regarding any
malfunctioning of glide slope signal/ILs equipment, In the event
a pilot making an ILS approach, does not get the glide slope
signal on his airborne equipment, the descend below 3700 ft is
discontinued and assistance of any other navigational aid is then |
taken for let down. In the instant case this probability can be
ruled out as there had been no transmission by the pilot of the
accidented aircraft of abandoning the descend below 3700 ft. due
to airborne equipment failure or equipment failure on ground,
The only alternative, therefore, is the possible failure of
non-intercepting the glide slope during the approach phase,

As already stated in a preceding para that from FL 55
the aircraft was descending at 1800 ft per minute and that too in j
a clean configuration i.e. with both flaps and gear’ retracted.
Also the descend was in _ total Instrument Meteorological
Conditions with clouds and rain showers accompanied with
turbulence. The last transmission from the aircraft was its
descend through 4000 ft. The aircraft manufacturers in its Pilot
Operating Hand book for the type aircraft in its Performance
Chapter Section V gives the landing distance calculation for a
recommended 800 ft per minute approach with flaps down. Also the

Jeppessen charts for ILS runway 27, Bombay recommends that at
ground speed of 140 kts the rate of descend on the glide slope
Should be 8628 ft. per minute. In view of the above, it can be
inferred that the pilot continued his descend at a high rate
“ithout cross checking his height for glide slope capture at or
after descending through 3700 ft.
In para 1.5 above on Personnel Information, it has been
elaborated that the involved pilot had only 2 hours of Instrument
flying in the preceding six months on the type aircraft. His
{ total flying experience on the type aircraft also is 28:45 hrs.
4 Cf which he had logged 18:20 hrs. during the preceding six
Months,
The meagre flying experience of the involved Pilot on
the type aeroplane coupled with experiencing monsoonic weather
18

during the approach phase on runway 27 requiring precision
instrument flying on ILS, has in all probability, led to the
pilot getting disorientated on instruments inside clouds.
Consequent thereto he descended much below the stipulated height
without intercepting the glide slope.
Di 3.6 ATC Factor :
{ The involved aircraft VT-EQM after coming in contact
with Bombay Approach 127.9 MHz was vectored on radar by an
appropriately rated Controller Shri P. Ohri of NAA, Bombay. From
the ATC tape transcript as well as statement of the Controller it
js evident that after giving the aircraft a radar vector of 180°
initially he could not identify the aircraft on the screen and
had, therefore, given subsequent heading 090 whence it was
identified. The radar Controller Shri Ohri had further stated
that he had while giving heading to steer from 090 did not inform
the aircraft of vectoring him for an ILS approach. He contended
that he had asked the aircraft to intercept the localizer and
having observed on the scope of aircraft VT-EQM intercepting the
localizer had released the aircraft to the Tower. This is
contrary to the laid down procedures stipulated in DOC 4444
because in the instant case the aircraft after having been told
to intercept the localizer had not yet confirmed on the RT to the
Controller of it having accomplished the same.

The Radar Controller Shri P. Ohri had further admitted
his lapse that before releasing the aeroplane to Tower frequency,
he had not obtained report of the aircraft established on _ ILS,
which normally happens at 10.5 NM. From the ATC tape transcript,
it is revealed that after the last report from the aircraft was
received at 0623 UTC on ATC timing the Radar Controller had not
transmitted termination of radar service to the aircraft and also

\ had not checked the position of the aircraft VT-EQM for the next
| 7 minutes till queried by the Tower Controller on the intercom.
| This is indicative that the Radar Controller was not monitoring
| the aircraft VT-EQM which was then still under his control. The
| Radar Controller had 5 aircraft in addition to VT-EQM from the

I time VT-EQM first came in contact with Radar Controller. At 0621

p UTC, the Radar Controller having advised aircraft VT-EQM to

|, intercept localiser from the right, had in actual only three

; additional aircraft viz. IC-176, GFA-053 and BBC-017 under his

; radar control. This cannot: be considered as a heavy work load

q on a Controller so as to make him miss one particular

; aircraft of the lot for nearly 7 minutes after it had been

} advised by him to intercept the localizer.

In view of the above, even though the role of the ATC
Radar Controller is not a direct cause to this accident, yet if
the laid down procedures of Radar Control had been followed and
the aircraft position monitored, the pilot with meagre flying
experience and limited instrument flying having encountered

, Instrument Meteorological Conditions could have got some positive
assistance from the Radar Controller to possibly take remedial
measures and avoid the accident.

with only 2 hours of instrument flying on the type.

4. Prior to commencement of flight from Ahmedabad the
aircraft had adequate fuel on board and the sample of fuel
uplifted at Ahmedabad met the quality control specifications.

- 6. Prior to commencement of flight from Ahmedabad the
Commander had obtained Meteorological briefing in an oral manner.
However, Flight Forecast was not provided as the commander had
not filed any prior requisition with the Met.Department.
i 6. The Meteorological report issued at Bombay valid at the
/ time of accident indicated winds as 280/06 kts, gusting to 16
ij kts. and visibility of 3000 meters. The trend reported was Tempo
| visibility 1500 meters in moderate rain showers, The visibility
i reported was within the minima filed by NRSA and included in
their Operations Manual.

7. The weather encountered by the aircraft during the

approach particularly before the outer marker was total IMC with
overcast accompanied by rain showers and turbulence as was
experienced by other pilots who had landed before and soon after
the accident.

: 8. The navigational aids at Bombay Airport at the time of
accident flight were operating normal with no report of
malfunction either on ground or by aircraft inflight using the

j facility before and after the accident flight. However, after the
accident there had been frequent reports both on ground and from

19. The aircraft had prior to reaching the outer marker was
descended to a height much below the stipulated height of 2910
q ~- ft. on QNH over the outer marker.
i 21

20. the Radar Controller Shri P. Ohri of NAA, Bombay, while
giving instructions for steering to the aircraft did not inform
the aircraft of its being vectored for an ILS approach and also

did not obtain confirmation from the aircraft of its having

accomplished the instructions to intercept localizer. This is
contrary to the laid down procedures of radar vectorjng,.

21. The Radar Controller did not monitor for nearly 7
minutes the accidented aircraft which was still then under radar
control service, after the aircraft had reported passing through
4000 ft.

4. CAUSE :

The Commander of the aircraft having meagre flying
experience on type and limited instrument flying hours
encountering Instrument Meteorological Conditions descended below
the ATC cleared height of 3700 ft. without intercepting the glide
slope.

The Radar Controller by not effectively monitoring the
aircraft position after he had advised it to intercept the
localizer contributed to the cause of the accident.

; 5. RECOMMENDATIONS :

1. NRSA, the owner of the aircraft while deploying their
pilots, should ensure that they are adequately trained and
experienced in flying through actual weather conditions.

2. NKSA whould in view of Lhe nature of their flying
tasks, ensure to operate their aircraft with two qualified pilots
where the cockpit has proviso for two pilot seats.

3. Action as deemed appropriate may be taken against the
Radar Controller for the lapses as indicated in the findings of
the report.

4. NAA should carry out random checks by an appropriate
level of officers, on the on-job performance of their Air Traffic
Controllers.

; 5. NAA should organise periodic interactions between their
Alr Traffic Controllers and Communication wing officials for
in-house ‘assessment of equipment problems and taking remedial
