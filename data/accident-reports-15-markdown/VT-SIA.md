INTRODUCTION
This unfortunate crash is different than most
of -
the earlier ones since here it happened durino a
training flight and not during a regular revs.n,
.s earn-
ing flight.
Sahara India airline=. (nenceforth referred as
'Sahara') Boeing 737-200 Aircraft (VT
-SIA) on a local
training flight at Delhi Airport on 8th March, 1994
crashed at about 2.54 PM when it was in the process of
executing the sixth circuit after uneventfully complet-
ing the fifth touch and go exercise. The crash result-
ed in death of 9 persons of which 3 were trainee pilots
viz. Pramod Singh, Vidul Mahajan and Ms.Anshu Khurana
who lost their lives at the prime of .their youth •=lt the
very threshold of entering the professional career as
Pilots.(cid:9)
Capt.Parveen Khurana the Instructor on the
illfated flight also lost his life.
It was the first training flight
for 3 young trainee pilots on Boeing Aircraft. It waE
also the first flight of Capt.j<hurana as an inst
ructor-.
It was also the first such crash during trainin
,1
organised by a Air Taxi operator in India.
F •
Apart from the aforesaid four persons, four
Aeroflot personnel also lost their lives as a result of
1

this crash on account of the wreckaoe of the Sahara
aircraft ploughing through the Aeroflot IL-86 Aircraft
parked nearby, On =mplrly==. of Pharat Petroleum al=r
,
lost his life.
The impact of the aircraft resulted in a fir
which completely destroyed both the Aircraft.
(cid:9) Thr=
was also extensive damage to at least two Aerobridoe=.
other items on ground which were in the vicinity
also suffered extensive damage.
Soon after the accident, Mr.V.KChandna,
Director of Air Safety, was appointed to act as Inspi=c-
tor of Accidents under Rule 71 of the Aircraft Rules
1937 (the Rules). The Government of India also direct-
ed that a formal investigation of the accident be held
as stipulated by Rule 75 and anpinl
-ed TG 4-o
as the Court in terms of Notification dated 6th May,
1994.

_SecrF>tary to the Court.
In the report not only the finding(cid:9)
to t-ha.
causes of the accident and circumstances thereof are
required to be stated but any observations and recom-
mendations which the rnurt may think fit are also
required to be made for preservation of life and avoid-
ance of similar accidents in future.
On 13th May 1994, Mr.H.S.Khola, Director
General, DGCA, along with Mr.Satinder Singh, Deputy
Director General, Mr. V.K.Chandna and Mr.J.S.Wazir met
me and briefed me about the accident and the investiga-
tion that had been carried out upto that time. During
this briefing I was also informed that Cockpit Voice
Recorder (CVR) and Universal Flight Data Recorder
-(UFDR) had been retrieved and preserved for fha inves-
tigatiOn purposes.
On 18th May. 1994 the first meeting with the
Asses
sors was held which was also attended by Mr,Khola,
Mr.Satinder Singh and Mr.Chandna. A general discussion
on aircraft ritails flying training syllabus. Pilot
training details, experience, profile etc. took place
and it was decided that the crash ,sitF, and wreckage
would be inspected on 20th May, 1994.
••1

On 20th May, 1994, I along with the Asse-.
and aforesaid Officers and Mr.Harbans Kumar, Airport
visited the crash site and inspected the

crash site the impact marks and other ground marks
indicating the direction of the.ilight at the time of
impact were shown and explained to us by Mr.Chandna.
He also told us broad facts about the spread of the
disintegrated parts of the Sahara Aircraft and how the
said parts had hit the parked Aeroflot Aircraft and
the destruction and the subsequent fire. W
caused(cid:9)
also visited Sub Fire Station II and it was explained
that the fire fighting and rescue staff from toe said
Fire Station was the first to respond to the crash.
-
The wreckage of the two aircraft placed near interna
tional Cargo Complex was also inspected.
-
On 23rd May, 1994, I again visited the Air
-
port along with the Assessors to observe the function
200 aircraft systems relevant for
ing of various B-737-
the purposes of further investigation of the accident
in question. The functioning of the various aircraft
systems and controls of Boeing aircraft were explained
to me. The Air Traffic Control was also visited where
of Aerodrome, NAA explained the duties and.
Director
functions of various personnel working in the Air
Traffic Control units including the facilities and

equipments for recording the Air-
Traffic Conversation.
On 25th May, 1994, accompanied with Assessors
I visited the Office of DEICA for hearing conversation
on
CVR. .Regarding the horn sound in CVR Mr.Safinder
Singh explained that the same can be sub
.ecter to
spectrum analysis and compared with the known spectrum
of various warning sound/horns for identification.
also inspected the UFDR and found it to be in a damacied
condition. It was partly burnt.
I was informed that Director General had
constituted a group comprising of Mr.N.M.Moorti, As-
sistant Director from National Aeronautic Laboratory,
Group Captain Mr.C.Chandrasekharan, VSM (Retd.) cf
YSM
Aerospace, Mr.P.M. Ramachandra, Officiating Engineering
Manager, Air India and Mr.V,K. chandna to study various
alternatives for recovery of data from the damaged UFDR
retrieved from the accident site. On considering the
recommendations of the said Group as contained in their
report dated 13th March,
1994 and after discussion
with Assessors, I directed that the condition of the
tape shall be seen at the Laboratory of Air India. at
Bombay and depending upon the condition of the tape
will be decided, whether it was possible
, r worthwhile
to .retrieve the data in India or the LIFDR was required
to be sent abroad.(cid:9) I further direrfed (cid:9)
manufac-

turer of UFDR should be informed about our intentihne to
Open the Unit in India so that they may send a repre-
sentative in whose presence the Unit may be opened and
data retrieved if possible. The manufacturershowev-
b
er, did not opt to send a representative:- All the four
persons constituting the Group that had given the
report dated 13th March, 1774 were directed to be
present at the Laboratory of Air Indi,. Bombay. It wae
decided that in the Laboratory of Air India at Bombay,
first the cover will be removed from the casing of UFDR
and if the tape inside show any sign of damage, a
decision will be taken on the spot for taking the Unit
abroad.
The UFDR was opened at the Laboratory of Air
India at Bombay with the assistance of experts from Air
India and VSM Aerospace, Bangalore. On opening the
UFDR it was observed that electronics of the Unit had
been damaned to some extent ht. the raneule containing
the UFDR tape appeared to be undamaged. On the opening
of the Capsules it was found that the driving motor was
iammmed and it was, therefore replaced with a servir-e-
able motor.(cid:9)
The data from thetape was dumped on a
casettee.(cid:9)
I direted Mr.s7
handna to take the .caette
to VSM Aerospace, Bangalore, for getting the print out.
Air Commodore -arc:ha was also requested
-o accompan
Mr.Chandna.(cid:9)
The _decision to transfer the data was
taken after observing the satisfactor--• condition of the
6

capsule assembly.(cid:9) 1-*
was explained to me that •=c1m=
, of
the data, in the print out taken at t—m Laboratory.
Bangalore, was erratic and needed careful study. Aft5=r
discussion with the Assessors and DGCA Officers I
directed that to clarify the erratic data
(cid:9) fir=-1- am
attempt should be made at National Aeronautical Labora—
tory, Bangalore, and it is only thereafter a deci=.-ion
can betaken whether it is necessary to have
fi
sistance for the analysis of the data from National
Transport Safety Board, Washington or not.
I directed that public notice should be
issued in the main newspapers, one of which should also
be in a vernacular language latest by 10th June,
1994
requiring any person having direct or relevant
knowledge or information about
(cid:9) accident or the
causes or circumstances leading to the said accident
or who may or is likely to be affected by the finding
of the Court of Inquiry to.
furnish statement in writinm

been made in the report of Inspector of Accidents.
For taking out the UFDR data print, the NAL,
Bangalore was visited on 25th June, 1994. BP=cr,--
of the work I directed the Officers to ensure that the
tape does not suffer any damage while conducting the
replay. It was duly adhered to. The print out showed
that some of the data was still erratic.(cid:9) Mr.Satinder
Singh and Mr.Chandna were asked to carry out the UFDR
data study.
In a meeting held on 2nd July, 1994, which
was attended by the Assessors as also by Mr.Khnla,
Mr.Safinder Singh and Mr.Chandna, it was explained that
some of the data was erratic and since we have reached
the dead end of our capabilities and, therefore, it was
advisable to approach NISB, USA for analysis of the
UFDR data. The matter was taken up by Mr.Chandna and
Mr.Wazir with NTS2 and they agreed to render all 'as-
sistance.

The unit.was exposed to fire and smoke
could be seen on
the side walls and also inside. The steel body con
taining the tape transport mechanism appeared to be

intact.
The unit was taken to Air India facilities at Bombay
for opening and copying the data from the tape.(cid:9) Fol-
lowing observations were made:
The frame structure for mounting the electronic boards
and the transport/environmental enclosure was bent on
front side due to impact. The transport/environmental
enclosure had detached from the mountings but appeared
to be intact except for smoke deposit on casing.(cid:9) The
top frame cover was removed by opening out the attach-
ment phillips screws to take uut the enclosure.(cid:9) There
was no apparent damage to stepper motor, connector and
.the wiring appeared to be intact. The motor cover had
detached during the impact and there was some stiction
in the motor rotation, although the belt appeared to be
intact.(cid:9) The condition inside the enclosure was good
and tape appeared to be intact.
The enclosure of UFDR of the crashed aircraft was then
installed in a serviceable UFDR of M/s.Sahara India
Airlines. As the stepper motor of the crashed aircraft.
UFDR was jammed, the stepper motor of the serviceable
Unit was installed on the transport/enVironmental

IGI Airport is managed by International Airport Authority
of India. This airport is equipped with category IX fire
fighting services, which cover heavier aircraft like Boeing-
747 category. There are three fire stations i.e.Main
Station located near 'D' Taxi Track, Sub Fire Station-I
close to domestic apron and Sub Fire StatiOn-II close to
66

the International Apron. There are 6 Crash Fire Ten-
ders, two water tenders, one highlight platform and
Ambulances.(cid:9) There are 15 static tanks of different
capacities at different locations at _the airport.
Static tank No.9 and Static Tank No.11 are located near
the accident site.
A Group was Constituted by DGCA to examine the fire
fighting aspects and a detailed report in this regard
was prepared. Following are the salient observations
from the report:
1. Aircraft accident took place at 1454 hrs IST at the
International Terminal Apron (Apron-II) of Delhi
Airport-
2. The aircraft disintegrated during the crash and
wreckage hit the Aeroflot aircraft parked on Bay
No.45. The wreckage of aircraft was spread over
the. aprony:area: There was fire all over the_ apron
ajf
on the scattered pieces of wreckage and intense
fire on the Aeroflot aircraft.
3. The Control Tower•had sounded the siren imme-
diately.
4. IAAI Apron T-II Assistant Airport Manager had
transmitted on FUT that Sahara India Airlines
aircraft has crashed at Terminal II ,Tron.
67

5. Some.Main Fire Station personnel had seen the
aircraft coming down and they immediately swung
into action.
6. Initially, the Crash Fire Tenders from Sub Fire
Station-II which is located nea - Apron T-II
reached the crash site followed by Main Fire
Station and Sub Fire Station-I. The fire fighting
vehicles from the IAAI Fire Fighting Training
school located adjacent to Airport also reached the
site of crash Fire fighting action began in about
three minutes after the crash time.
Air Force'Station Palam Domestic Fire Tenders and
a water-tender also reached-the-site of crash at
1510 hrs and assisted IAAI fire fighting services.
Water was also supplied to Airport Crash Fire
Tenders.
The Delhi Fire Services received the information
at 1505 hrs IST and the fire fighting vehicles
reached around 1520 hrs IST. Nineteen water
tenders and 2 ambulances along with other equip-
ments participated in the fire fighting. About
125 Officers and men of Delhi Fire Services with
units participated in this operation.
68

9. The IAAI Airport fire fighting vehicles were
supported by Delhi Fire Services, Air Force
Station Palam for water supply from their water
tenders. The continuity of water supply was
maintained through the static water tanks at
the airport.
10. The total time taken to control the fire was
about 43 minutes (1457 hrs IST to 1540 hrs IST)
as per IAAI log books. However, as per Delhi
Fire Services, the fire was under control at
1615 hrS.
41. Though fuselage of the Aeroflot was completely
charred,-the spread of fire on to the wings was
checked which contained about 50 tonnes of fuel.
12. Number of vehicles and ground equipment were
destroyed in this fire. Also, apron area and
three aerobridges suffered damage. There were
nine casualities and 4 persons suffered injuries.
13. On the date of accident, the Airport Authority Fire
Services had 35,000 ltrs of water, 400 KgS of DCP
and
.500 Kgs.of BCF. Total of 42 Fire Fighting
Personnel were on duty.
69

There was no mobile water replenishment arrange-
14.
ment for the CFTs positioned for the fire fighting
resulting in dislocation of CFTs from ideal posi-
tion to collect water from'Static Tank No.9 & 11.
Thus the fire fighting operation was carried out
in stages.
15. The quality of the produced foam through the CFTs
of IAAI was not standard and the fire extinguish-
ing media was not creating required actions at
the fire to combat, as stated by their fire
officer.
1b. On two Crash Fire Tenders of IAAI, the monitor
controls was unserviceable and on other two Crash
Fire Tenders, these monitors became unserviceable
during fire fighting operation. Side channels for
fire fighting were used on these crash fire
tenders. The jet throw through the monitor did
not cover the specified distance and CFTs were
repositioned to the close vicinity of fire in
the danger zone.
1.15(cid:9) -• SURVIVAL ASPECT
The log -book-of•Sub Fire Station II and that of the
Fire Officer indicates that six dead bodies were recov-
70

ered from_ the wreckage. The bodies of Sahara India
Airlines crew had disintegrated and exposed to fire and
were lying scattered near Bay 45.
Around 1515 hrs. two injured persons Shri Ravinder and
Shri Ikrar Ali of Oberoi Flight. Kitchen were rescued
from the site and were sent to casualty centre at
terminal-I.(cid:9) From there they were sent to Ram Manohar
Lohia Hospital.
Five more injured persons by name S/Shri B.P.Mashi of
Bharat Petroleum Corporation, Damodaran of Aeroflot,
A*.Nikolai of Aeroflot with severe burns, Chagan Lal of
IAAI and Gautam Chatterjee of Oberoi Flight Kitchen
with multiple injuries were sent to Safdarjung Hospi-
-tal., Out of ,these persons Shri D.P.Mashi, Shri Damoda-
ran and Shri Nikolai succumbed to their injuries in the
hospital. Following are the extracts from Loo Book of

the body.
All the above three patients were given a wet saline
71

cleaning, then wrapped in blankets and given injec-
tions, stabilised and sent for Safdarjung Hospital at
1515 hours.
The other two casualities brought to Terminal II MI
Room were Shri Chagan Lal of IAAI who had received a
clean laceration wound on forehead and Shri Gautam

TEST AND RESEARCH
,16.1 .FLIGHT CONTROLS
GENERAL
The Boeing 737 aircraft features a powered flight
control system which has aileron'and flight spoilers
fOr lateral Control(roll), elevators and movable hori—
zontal stabiliser for longitudinal control(pitch),
rudder and yaw damper for directional control(yaw),
speed brakes for flight and ground aerodynamic braking
and high lift devices to provide lift at the lower
_speeds for take-off and landing.
Primary flight controlstailerons, elevators, rudder)
are powered by hydraulic systems 'A' and 'B'.(cid:9) Either
of hydraulic system, alone, can power any primary
72

control,_surface.(cid:9) In the event that both hydraulic
systems 'A' and 'B' become unavailable, the aileron and
elevator controls revert to a mechanical manual
reversion backup system and the rudder is powered by
the standby hydraulic system.
b) EXAMINATION
A group was constituted by DGCA to examine into flight
controls. Following are the salient observations from
the report.
i) TRAILING EDGE FLAPS
The system consists of four flaps, two on each wing
which are operated hydraulically through mechanical
transmission.(cid:9) Each flap has two flap screw jacks.
Thus there are a total of eight flap screw jacks.
Three flap screw jacks(No.6,7 and B) on the starboard
wing were found intact. No.5 flap screw jack, which
was not intact, was identified from the part number.
Three screw jacks(No.1,3 and 4) were identified from
their orientation and attachment. No.2 flap screw jack
could not be located. The measurement of various
•r ecovered screw jacks of accident aircraft, as record-
ed, are given below;-

The flap screw jack measurements on the accident
aircraft are quite close to the Flap 15 configuration
compared with the dimensions provided in Boeing
737 Control Position Data Document No. D6-19512-1 Rev.
ii. LEADING EDGE FLAPS
There are four L.E.flaps, two each on starboard and
port wings. All the four L.E.flap actuators have been
identified. Actuator No. 1 & 3 are intact while No.2 $
4 are in broken condition. During leading edge flap
extension, the actuator extension is about 7.95 inches.
In the accident aircraft case, the extension of No.1 &
3 actuators was also found to be about 7.9 inches.
;Thus the leading edge flaps were fully extended at the
time of accident.
74

iii. LEADING EDGE SLATS
There are six leading edge slats three on each side
which are actuated hydraulically by six actuators. Out
of six actuators, only, five could be retrieved. Actua—
tor No.4 & 5 are intact while another three are in
broken condition and could not be identified as for
their position due to breaking away of the name plates.
From(cid:9) the physical observations, of the(cid:9) retrieved
actuators, it may be concluded that the same were fully
extended.
SPOILERS
There are eight spoilers, four on each wing. No.1,4,5 &
8 are ground spoilers while No.2.3, 6 & 7 are flight
spoilers. Ground spoilers No. 4 & 5 have two actuators
each while other spoilers has only one actuator.
Spoilees.-Np(cid:9) are attached to starboard wing
and found flush with the surface.(cid:9) They are badly
bUrnt.(cid:9) Piston extension measurements of the rest of
the spoiler actuators also indicated that the spoilers
were retracted at the time of cra=_h.
v. AILERONS
There is one aileron on each wing operated by two power
control units (System 'A' and System 'B').(cid:9) Both the
aileron PCU's were recovered and were found to be
75

detached and in damaged condition due to impact
and
fire. The aileron trim gearbox was found in jammed
condition in near neutral position. One of the aileron
PCU's(lower) actuator extension is 1.125 inch corre-
Lt11 sponding to port aileron deflection about 9 degrees
Y
ccg down.(cid:9) Another PCU(upper) actuator extension is 0.25
inch corresponding to starboard aileron deflection of
about 16 degrees up. Both the left and right aileron
drive quadrants were found badly damaged. Drive cables
were found separated and curled up. The left aileron
quadrant was found jammed in counter clockwise direc-
tion with the push rod to aileron broken. No positive
conclusion could be drawn from the above observations.
vi. HORIZONTAL STABILIZER
The horizontal stablizer can be moved by motor operated
screw jack. The screw jack was found intact and its
ball-nut was found jammed in position.(cid:9) The measured
position of the ball nut corresponds to about 7 units
up (within green band of take-off configuration)_ as
confirmed on the serviceable aircraft.
vii. ELEVATOR
Both the elevator PCU's were found intact and in fully
retracted position. The feel and centring springs and
feel actuators moved smoothly and normally. The fully
7b

retracted position of both the PCU s indicate elevator
(cid:9)
up position. However, in view of impact forces, it
cannot be said that this was the elevator pnsif4on
prior to impact.
viii. RUDDER
Rudder was found intact and attached to the vertical
fin.(cid:9) Both, main and standby rudder PCU's were found
intact. When the main PCU is in operation the standby
idles.(cid:9) The actuator extension of main PCU was 2.25
inches while that of standby actuator was 2.8 inche=..
As checked from the Document No.D6-19512-1 Rev 'D' of
Boeing Co. regarding '737 aircraft control position
data', .the above measured actuator lengths indicate
that 'the rudder was deflected towards right about three
and a quarter degrees. However, in view of impact
damage to the aircraft and its controls, the exact
of the rudder prior to crash could not be
positively concluded.
Functional check of main rudder Pr!! ;Ind(cid:9) iliary Fr!!
were carried nuf. All the tests on main rudder PC11
Were carried out satisfactorily except the transducer
null voltage test wherein the null vf-ltaoe was observed
to be 185 mV as against a maximum limit of 150 mV.
Tests on auxiliary rudder FLU were also satisfactory
77

except servo valve neutral position test which was
found to be marginally out of limits. With this varia-
tion the units will still remain functional.
EXAMINATION OF UNDERCARRIAGE
Nose landing gear attachment was found det-ched from
main structure. Upper and lower drag brace link=. were
found damaged and came out from the main structural
fitting.(cid:9) Both the nose steering actuators were found
in damaged condition. In the port main gear assembly,
one of the tyres was found missing and the correspond-
ing brake assembly found stripped open.(cid:9) While other
was found damaged due to fire. Walking beam was- found
attached with the landing gear, however, it came out
from-the main structure. Oleo strut and locking mecha-
nism were damaged. Side strut found collapsed.(cid:9) Star-
board landing gear system disintegrated. Oleo piston
broke into two parts. One of the tyre was found burst.
Side strut was partially collapsed and the drag brace
was intact.(cid:9) Walking beam was found separated both
from main structure and landing gear. Both the main
and nose landing gears had extensive fire damage. Both
the main and nose landing gear actuators were found in
fully extended position indicating that all the three
gears were in fully retracted condition at the time of
accident.

Following is the extract from Boeing 737 Operations
Manual regarding the Stall Warning System:
STALL - WARNING SYSTEM
Warning of an impending stall is required to occur a
minimum of, seven percent above actual stall speed.
Natural stall warning (buffet) usually occurs at a
prior to stall. In some configurations the
gi44W6tWeen"stail-And'Stal1 warning (buffet) is less
than the required seven percent. Therefore, an artifi-
cial stall warning device, a stick shaker, is utilized
b'PrOVidethe required- warning,
warning system or "stick shaker" is designed
alert the pilots before a stall develops.(cid:9) The
warning is• given by vibrating both control columns•.
(cid:9)
- 4. The: s ystem is energized in flight at all :times._ The
sytem is deactivated on the ground by the airground
safety sensor.
The stall warning system consists of a control column
i•
shaker (eccentrit weighted motor), a heated angle of
airflow sensor, a flap position sensor, a stall warning
amplifier, the air-ground safety sensor and a stall
warning panel on the aft overhead panel.

ISSUES INVOLVED
Before dealing with the vital issues/aspects
to be examined in the enquiry, the issues/aspects in
respect of which there can neither be any controversy
nor there is one, namely sabotage and weather
conditions may first be dealt with.
SABOTAGE
During investigation the wreckage was
:eamiped:Aly a group constituted for the purpose
of
finding out the explosion/sabotage being the cause
the accident. The disintegrated parts of the aircraft
were examined with a view to find out whether the crash
was due to any explosive device or not.(cid:9) The salient
observations of the group report are:
The fragments/debris materials may have
curling/ringlet effects and spike toothed fractures on
metal surface.(cid:9) These characteristics have not been
observed in any part ofthe wreckage.
The incident of an explosion, the fragment
will strike the surface at a glancing angle and produce
gouge marks in the surface. No such gorge marks were
noticed on the recovered main wreckage.

Due .to the hot detonation gases, melting and
erosion on the surface of the metal is possible which
is termed as 'gaswash'. The debris/wreckage found in
heavily melted condition is not due to detonation
gases, but may be due to excessive heat generated
during the fire.
(cid:9)
4.
Cupping and dishing in the near vicinity
metal surface is a very common phenomenon with high
explosive detonation, which is not observed on
examination of the wreckage.
•
There' is possibility of embedding the high
velocity fragments in rubber foams/cushions during an
explOsion.(cid:9)
The recovered cushion seats were examined
to find out penetration holes of fragments/embedded
fragments.(cid:9)
No such sign of penetration have been
noticed.
6.
No part of bomb such as battery, Wirt.,
portion of detonators etc were recovered.
7.
On detailed inspection and investigation of
the wreckage debris- of the crashed aircraft, no
charatteristic evidence of an explosion such
as
fragmentation, curling/ringlet effects
spike toothed
structure of metals, gas washing, pitting and rolled
edges have been noticed. No sign of cupping/dishing of
42

metal surface is seen.;; No positive characteristics of
a mid air explosion were observed from the
wreckage/debris examined.
In view of above, it is concluded that crash
in question did not occur- due to sabotage or explo-
sion.
'WEATHER CONDITIONS.
The metrologica/ information/reports supplied
by the Met. Office of Delhi (Palam) indicate that there
was no significant weather at Palam around the time of
the accident. The aircraft was on visual circuit and
landing. The following weather existed at Palam around
the time of the accident:-

It is evident from the above that during the
period of training flight the visibility was around 8 Kms
and the weather was very fine and it did. not contribute
directly :or indirectly to the accident.(cid:9)
The weather
condition in Delhi was, therefore, not the cause of the
accident.

SYSTEMS FAILURE
the use of the Word The 'Syszems: itself
suggests, the ambit and scope of enquiry unge,r t.r,e head
Ryeferns Fe,illtre' is very wide. I+ includes the examination ,
of failure of aircr ft or any part thereof, failure of
9P,

manapea:SInt, failure of manufacturer of aircraft, failure of
maintenance, failure of airport authorities, failure of
regulatory body or any other organisation/system. All these
aspects of failure of systems other than that of failure of
-aircraft or its part would be examined and dealt with, for
the reason and sake of convenience, in the later nart of
•t his report, while dealing with the third issue namely of
'Regulatory and Control Functions of DGrA, NAA and IAAI.'
Before dealing with the aspect of failure of
part(s) of aircraft, let me notice the type of CVR & UFDR
fitted on the aircraft and also certain matters relating
thereto.
CVR
The fare child Cockpit Voice Recorder(CVR)
Model No.A-100 bearing Sl.No.3298 was fitted on the
aircraft. This CVR has megnatic type recordio on 4
channels;(cid:9) Channel Nn.1 is for Observor, Channel N.-"? for
First Officer, Channel No.3 for Captain and Channel No.4 for
Area Mike. The recording information for last 30 minutes is
• .
retained. Th= CVR had suffered impact ,D.rIfi fire damage.(cid:9) It
was• opened at CVR Laboratory c-s:(cid:9) opening
ir,ner
mtalir rasing and tape assembly were found intact:(cid:9)
The
tape remained protetted in the armoured unit and its condi—
tion was also foUnd satisfacLor,,. .The tape was 1-i4Ken out
and it was rlepiayed at DOCA Laboratory, initally reference
time was g ven during the preparation of tape transcript and
99

-then with the e1p of ATC transcript, reference time was
converted into universal coordinated time (UTC). The rele-
vant CVR tape transcript is Annexure "A" to this report.
- The UtC time in Annexure "A" were achieved by corelating
full 30 minute-detai-ted-record -on CVR.
UNIVERSAL FLIGHT DATA RECORDER (UFDR)
The parameters recorded in the UFDR fitted in
the aircraft- have already been noticed in earlier part of
this report as also the facts about external damage suffered
by the outer casing of this unit and also facts about the
data retrieved at M/s.VSM Aerospace Facility at Bangalore
and at National Aerospace Laboratory, Bangalore. On perusal
of the data decoded at the said two laboratories it was
considered necessary to get the data further refined at the
laboratory of'National Transport Service Board, Washington
who had long experience in the field. The Unit was
accordingly taken to Washington, USA and Mr.Dannis R.Grosy
and Mr.Elfard W.Dickenson participated in the meetings for
analysis Of the data and for read out from the. tape of the
UFDR Unit- in question. Mr.Dennis worked on the UFDR Unit
,?.rici transferred the data from the tape to the Computer and
then • protessed it.(cid:9) The report of NTSB is Px..(cid:9) The
reference in:this report to UFDR data, as was also done by
learned counsel for participants during arguments, is to the
data prepared by N.T.S.B., Washington. USA (Ex.6).(cid:9) The
100

relevant UFDR data is Anne>ure "B" to this report.
-TIME-CO-RELATION OF CVR.UFDR AND'ATC TIMING
Time is not recorded on CVR. On UFDR frame
_counter readings are recorded every second. These counter
readings are used as time counter. To achieve co-relation,
between CVR and UFDR, some specific points are required:
which can be identified on both CVR and UFDR. One of the
standard methods used for co-relation
is through the:
recording of VHF Keying parameter of-UFDR. A transmission'
i -from aircraft to ATC requires the use of Press
s— -to-Talk (PTT):,
.• switch.(cid:9) The UFDR records the use of PTT switch.
and this:-
parameter is known as VHF Keying. With the identification
f the transmissions to ATC recorded on the CVR, it i
possible to co-relate
CVR transmissions with UFDRr.
recordings.(cid:9) With the same method, the CVR recordings and
ATC recordings can be corelated. The ATC recordings have
t(cid:9) .
time channel which records time in UTC. The time of ATC is
normally co-related to CVR and UFDR as it is a real time,
ti
.± clock,
As noticed above, the corelation of time
given in CVR Transcript (Ann.'A') and as given in the earli-7-
er part of this report in relation to EPR value=. only was on
the basis of a full 30 minute period recorded
on' the
It was however, felt essential to obtain more accurate
corelation which was possible if the UFDR data and CVR;
transcript is required to be co--related

L

of- one minute or so, inssead of relying upon co-relation
done for 30 minutes. Accordingly, the co
-relation of CVR
transcript and UFDR data has been prepared as follows:-
A touch down sound of the 5th landing has been
recorded on CVR which is at 09:22:55 UTC, This touch down
can also be normally identified on the '`vertic
al accelera-
tion' parameter recorded on UFDR. The vertical acceleration
is recorded 8 times in a second. UFDR
.
read out shows that
touch down was between frame No. 2888 and 2889 during which
the vertical acceleration has a maximum peak of 1.75 G.
.This touch down point in the co-relation chart has been
taken as • 0 second and all other timings (in seconds) are
from this touch down point. This co-relation chart is
Annexure 'C' to this report. For better understanding the
frame number of UFDR read out have 'been incorporated in
another co-
relation chart which is Annexure 'D' to this
report.
To get more accurate time on CVR transcript in
aforesaid charts -
for CVR recordings of about 50 seconds were
stored in 5 frames of 10 seconds each in spectrum analyser
and the touch down was used to determine the exact timings,
of the CVR call outs.
102

CRASH POINT
In CVR the last touch down point after the 5th
circuit and the crash point is clearly recorded.(cid:9)
The
time differences between thy. two events from the exact
timings obtained by above method is 43.5 second=..(cid:9)
On
UFDR touch down point is identified by the 5th record—
q".
ing of vertical acceleration peak of 1.3.5 G in frame
No.2888 i.e. half frame. The last recording of UFDR is
till end of frame No.2931 which contains all good
retordings of vertical acceleration. Therefore, as per
UFDR the time differences between touch down and last
recording is (2932 minus 2888.5) 43.5 seconds. Instead
of taking 2931, the figure 2932 has been taken since,
as stated above, the recording till the end of. 2931
contains all good recording of vertical acceleration.
It stands clearly established that the time differences
from touch down to crash point is 43.5 seconds.
ENGINE PRESSURE RATIO (EPR)
The 'fall in the value of EPR of the left
engine also stands fully established from the material
and data on record. None of the participants including
counsel for Mrs.Khurana disputed the facts relating to
10:3

the fall of EPR value of the - left engine. The decline:
in the left engine ERR started from UFDR Time 2909 and
it continued for 5 seconds i.e. upto time frame 2914.
In just 3 seconds (UFDR time frame 2910 to 2912) there
has been about 30% drop in ERR value. During 5 second=
from 2909 to 2914 the aircraft developed a positive
rate of climb and at UFDR time
291=S Capt-Khurana an-
nounced that he was putting the 'gear up".
(cid:9) The ERR
value of left engine is almost constant from UFDR time
2914. to 2917. The EPR value again started
a drop from
UFDR -time 2917 and reached almost idle position at UFDR
time 2921. At UFDR time 2919 the unsafe landing confi-
gration horn sounded. At UFDR time 2922 Capt.Khurana
called "Rudder, Rudder, Rudder". The aircraft rolled
severely to the left reaching an extreme of 101.9
degrees left wing down at FDR time 2927. Within about
less than 2 seconds Capt.Khurana shouted "Na Na leave
leave".
ti
According to Mr. Mahajan, counsel for
Mrs.Khurana, the drop in EPR was not on account of
retarding the left engine thrust lever by Capt.Khurana-
but it was on accuJnt of fuel starvation as a result of
maI functioning of Fuel Control Unit.(cid:9)
Accgrding to
other participants the drop in ERR value of left engine
was on account of retarding of left engine thrust lever
-
by Capt.Khurana.
104

F.C.U.
Mr.Mahajan suggests that the Fuel Control Unit
of the- left engine (Port engine) was not fully func-
tional and the blockage of the fuel nozzles could have
led to the drop of EPR value.
The aircraft had been subjected to 7C Check in
USA -in 1993 before it was flown to India. Further, fhr
,
aAr'cr4ft had .been subjected to 'C' check on 6th March
1994 and it is in evidence that at that time the fuel
nozzes Were cleaned. The Symptoms of Fuel starvation
in an aircraft specially on take off stage, when full
power is applied, are typical. No attempt has been
made in evidence to bring out the typical symptoms of
fuelarvation. or of blocked nozzles..(cid:9)
Neither the
_pilot nor the engineer witnesses have been asked spe-
cific and pointed questions on this aspect of symptoms
of fUel starvation. If FCU was not functioning or was
mal - functioning, as suggested by Mr.Mahajan
(cid:9) during
•
submission, certainly there would have been some indi-
cations in the Cockpit.(cid:9)
It is not so. The FCU is a
condition monitored component. According, to
Mr.S.Krishnan the Quality Control - Manager of Sahara,
who appeared as a witness, the FCII is a condition
monitored. component and had had done
728o hours since
- installation. Mr.Krishnan also stated that fuel nozzle
105

-cleaning was done on 6th March, 1994 at the time of
Check.(cid:9)
It is stated that it took about more than 300
man power to carry out the C check in which more than
40
persons were involved.(cid:9)
According to Witness No.7 •
Mr.P.K.Chhatopadhaya also the Fuel Nozzle cleaning was
carried out on 6th March, 1994 and that the Sahara
possessed the necessary nozzle cleaning facility from
the very inception of the organisation. The drop in
(cid:9)
EPR
has been gradual. Had there been total sudden
•
stoppage of fuel, it would result in abrupt drop of EPR
Value.(cid:9)
On the other hand, if total stoppage of fuel-
inflow is not there but there is only a leakage of
fuel, it would not result in the EPR value dropping to
idle,(cid:9)
In such an eventuality the drop in EPR can
(cid:9) be
set .off,, by use of the throttle.
(cid:9)
The EPR has not
dropped abruptly but gradUally. It may also
be noticed
that while setting the take off power of an engine, the
crew is required to open the throttle to the extent
that gives the required take off EPR as per the atmos-
pheric condition. There is no evidence to show that
the engine did not develop the required power. If the
Compressor Delivery Process(CDP) line was loose it
would have created a
-
leak which would have required the.
throttle • to move further than that of Engine No.2 and
there would certainly been a mention of it during the
training flight. No such mention has been made.
(cid:9) In
this view of the matter the condition of 10 PSI( Pounds
106

Per Squai-e Inch) of Engine No.1 and 11 PSI of Engine
No.2 is of no consequence and is not indicative of
looseness of CDP line causing drop in the performance.
Regarding suggested mal functioning of P & D value by
not tightening the input or output lines of the same
oversight, it has to be noticed that these lines handle
fuel under a very high pressure and any loo=_,_ness will
cause a very high fuel leak which cannot be missed and
in absence of any indication of it the mai functioning
of P & D value is ruled out. Further, such mal func-7
.tinning: would also affect the starting of the engine
and there is no evidence to show that the starting of
the engine.was effected in any manner. There is-also no
evidence that there was any loud compressor soiled
noise since the sudden blockage of CDP line would have
resulted in such,a noise Which cannot be missed.(cid:9) No
such.sound has 'been recorded by CVR. The blockage and
shearing of CDP line is ruled out.
The FCU was inspected by a Team of Experts at'
Calcutta.(cid:9) The 'FCU inspection report 'is Ex.3.(cid:9) The
inspection had taken place nearly 4 months after the
accident. The basis of submission of ECU malfuncfion-
ing is this report.(cid:9) If seetil.,,, how-ever,(cid:9) clear that
the ECU having been exposed to weathering as part of
wreckage for over four months rust have got somewhat
further damaged. Even grass was formed inside it.(cid:9) It
cannot be that FCU was in such a condition on 8th F.1-ch
107

1994 during the flight. The FCU mal functioning
on
account of 3 D Cam wear/rusting during the course of
Shop Test/Strip examination report (Ex.3) as noticed
above, would have been on account of exposure for about
4 months. (cid:9)
If the condition of FCU, when it was
-----in—
stalled in the Aircraft, had been as mentioned in Ex..?,
it would have certainly reflected in the performance of
the engine and the behaviour of the engine would have
been reported by the Pilots of the previous sectors.
Nothing of the kind was done. The consistent operation
2 of the.
engine prior to the crash suggests that there
was no Mal functioning of FCU attribd-tRble
to 3 D.Cam.
I may, however, mention that FCU being one of vital
component should not have been left on site and ought
to have preserved by the Inspector of Accidents to
avoid its exposure to weather conditions..
Mr.Nahajan submitted that as per 'C' check
- schedule the removal and installation of P&D valve
s
requires that serial number of the port and starboard
•
valves should be inserted on the sheet. at the time of
removal as well as installation to ensure that there is
no intermixing of valves of the port and starboard
engine. -Learned counsel also pointed out that here
neither the.. off- number nor(cid:9)
numhgr.r has been
entered during the 'C' check .(cid:9) It hEL-,- -further been
.pointed out that there is requirement of collection
of
1C6B

samples of engine oil and sending the same for chemical
analysis and in-this 'case-
no such finding with regard
to result of such analysis has been recorded in the
'C' Check schedule which would be essential to monitor
the possibility of a power failure of the engine. It is
further pointed Out that there is a requirement of 15
seals for the purpose of carrying out C Check. It is
submitted that nowhere in the C' check schedule it ha=-
been stated whether the seals were actually procured
and changed.(cid:9)
It is submitted that at the time of
installation of F' & D valve in 'C' check seals have to
be changed since the seals cannot be reused once the P
D valve is removed. It has been inftrred that use of
the old seals could certainly result in fuel leak/power
loss.
Though there may be substance in the
itiomission- in regard to the maintenance of record •as
pointed out by Mr.Mahajan, but this only shows that
(cid:9)
the record is expected to be maintained by the
Operator at the time of carrying out 'C' check schedule
was not properly maintained. Nothing more than this
can be inferred particularly keeping in view the obser-
vations made hereinbefore that assuming therc.
, was
leakage it would. have affected the starting of the
engine and there is no evidence to show that the engine
was affected in any manner and also that the loose P
D valve. would have been noticed since these lines
109

handle fiTel under a very heavy pressure and looseness
will cause a very high fuel leak which cannot he
(cid:9)
missed. Therefore, the non maintenance of the record -
properly during 'C' check schedule is certainly an
irregularity(cid:9) but the same cannot be attributed as a
cause of the accident.
RUDDER CONTROL UNIT.
Mr.Mahajan then contended that it iss possible
•t hat rudder actuated piston in the aircraft may have
gone in a direction opposite to.the intended direction
resulting in reduced controlability of the.
aircraft
which may have caused the accident. If that was so
there would certainly have been indication in the CVR
about the mal functioning of rudder.. The call "rudder,
rudder, rudder" was made at UFDR time frame 2922. and
the crash occurred at the end of UFDR time frame
\.
In this phase of 9 seconds or during about n
seconds
from the call 'leave, leave' to the time of crash there
is .nothing in CVR to suggest the mal functioning of
rudder which is difficult to accept in case the rudder
was mal functioning and going in a direction opposite
to intended one.
Further the rudder F'CU was- examined in Indian
Airlines facilities and the test was found satisfacfcl-
110

ry.(cid:9) In the said test, however, the dual servo valve
manufactured by Mis.Parkar Henifin could not be
checked. The unit was also sent to Mis.Parkar Henifen.
The report of the said organisations establishes
beyond doubt that there had been no reversal of rudder
control. The report rules out any jam. In view of the
fact that there was no jam and also bearing in mind
other aspects noticed above, the fact that dual sr=rv,--
valve may have been changed by someone other than th e
manufacturer, (a fact which could not .be ascertained on
account of absence of the complete maintenance record
- of the rudder unit) in any case, does not show the mal
-functioning of rudder PCU. It is.therefore,concluded
that the mal functioning of rudder PCU has not been
established as a cause of the accident.
Two other aspects which were vaguely suggested
by learned counsel Mr.Mahajan may be also' dealt with
here.
DISINTEGRATION
The first relates to disintegration of the
tail portion and/or port wing -from the aircraft in
at about 464 feet above around lev,a1. In that renar-d
- it was also suggested that this disintegration' would
also explain the disruption of power supply to UFDR/CVR
at the said altitude. Firstly, learned counsel is
assuming the disruption of power supply to ifFnR/CVR
t 11

when the ail-craft was at about 464 feet above ground
level. .There is nothing to suggest that there was any
such disruption. The theory of disintegration of the
tail portion and/or port wing in air also does not find
any support from the material on record. It may be
noticed that G loads had not exceeded 1.7 G, which is
well within the '13 envelope of(cid:9)
2 to - 1. The form e=.
created on the ill fated aircraft will not be strong
enough to cause disintegration. The speed was about
tr4(cid:9)
150 knots only. It is well below the maximum speed of
(cid:9)
350 knots. Aileron reversal will take place at the
maximum speed of about 350 knotes where the wing will
twist because of maximum deflection.(cid:9)
Further, the
structural disintegration also does not suggest that
disintegration took place in the air.(cid:9)
The accident
took place .during the day light.(cid:9)
The aircraft was
noticed by the Staff at the Airport while it was in
air.(cid:9) No eye witness has come forth to state that the
(cid:9) aircraft disintegrated in air. The portions of the
Q.
aircraft aforesaid were also found in the tarmac area
of the Airport. If the aircraft had disintegrated in
air these portions would have been found in(cid:9)
larger
area and would not have been localised in the tarmac
area.(cid:9) From all these accounts the disintegration of
the aircraft in air is completely ruled out.
112

WAKE VORTEX
The phenomenon of Wake Vortex which affect=
the flow over the wings or control surfaces when one
aircraft follows another aircraft
oft' has also no applica-
bility to the present case. It has come in evidence
that the Wake Vortex effEcts are more lethal when the -
aircraft(cid:9)
landing because of the low, speed and this
phenomenon ordinarily does not affect when the aircraft
is taking off because the aircraft is at full power and
its speed is rapidly increasing and aircraft is gaining
height. The Sahara aircraft, being a medium aircraft,
did not land behind any heavy aircraft.
(cid:9) The only
related air traffic was the take off by a medium air-
craft i.e. Avro, which preceded the take off of the
fateful aircraft by over 3 minutes. In the light of
the provisions contained in ICAO DOC 4444 the time is
longer than what is contemplated even where the preced-
ing aircraft was a heavy aircraft. The applicability
of the phenomenon of Wake Vortex as vagitely suggested
by counsel for Mrs.Khurana is also ruled out.
CREW ERROR
Let me +-irst
notice Line Crew Action.
The co-
relation charts Annexure 'C' and 'D'
which are accurate upto half a second. show that:-
fZ

1)(cid:9)
Immediately after the rotate call the pitch of
the aircraft had started increasing;
Immediately after-
the call outs 'Nothing is
happening' and 'Let us see what to do now', EPR of
engine No.1 had started decreasing;
3)(cid:9)
The positive climb call out shows that at that
time the aircraft had attained the positiv
(cid:9) rate nf
climb;
4)
When the 'Gear up' call out is given the EPR
of Engine No.1 stopped reducing further;
5)
The horn sound has been recorded around 7.0.5
seconds from the touch down (Frame No.2919) When the
.aircraft was 359 feet above ground level; (1111.9 minus
760);
6)
Prior to the 'Rudder, Rudder, Rudder' call the
aircraft was rolling to the left gradually and after.
the .call 'Na, Na, Leave, Leave', the rate of roll has
increased sharply;
Uo •
7)
The maximum roll was about 100 degrees( Minu
s
101.9 degrees at frame No.292
8) which subsequently.
reduced to about 60 degrees( Minus 59.30 degrees at
No.290);
B)(cid:9)
The aircraft attained the maximum height of
498 feet above ground level in about 37.5 seconds. from
the touch down (Fr,Rimr=. r-1.2526) and started descending
thereafter;
9) (cid:9)
The stick shaker warning started at about
7:9.=;
114

seconds from touch down (Frame No.2928) and remained
till the crash. At the time of initiation, of stick
shaker warning, roll angle of the aircraft was at its •
maximum of 101.9 degrees to the left and the pitch
attitude was about 8 degrees nose downs--
10)(cid:9)
At the time of crash the speed of the aircraft
was increasing and was ;_,round 150 knots. The attitude
of the aircraft was about 19 degrees nose down and
about 76 degrees to the left bank. The EF'R of Engine
No.1 shows slight increase in value.
In order to understand the crew action the
aforesaid aspects would have to be kept in mind. I may
also notice that the altitude reading on the UFDR shows
that the aircraft was about more than 400 feet above
grOund level at Frame No. 2931. The altitude reading
after Frame No. 2926 cannot be accepted as valid.
Beside the reasons already noticed earlier, it has to
be borne in mind that the values of the corrected roll
angle recorded in the Frame No. 2926 have shown the
increase in the left bank from 58.97 degrees to 81.12
degrees; the values of corrected
roll angles in Frame
No. 2927 shows a left bank of more than 90 degrees and
these values show abnormal attitude and have probably
affected the altitude value. The value of the altitude
recorded in Frame No. 2926 is 1257.7 feet which is
about 498 feet above ground level and is the maximum
height gained by the aircraft. The crash is about 6
115

econds later.— The height of 498 feet was lost in six
seconds. The average rate of decend during the period
works out to be (498 x 6016) equal to 4980 feet per
minute. Further, the corrected roll readings recorded
on the UFDR show that the aircraft has remained in that
altitude of more than 90 degrees for 2 seconds i.e.
during the Frame No. 2927 and 2928 and thereafter if
has started recovering in the next two frames.(cid:9) It
is, therefore, appropriate that the altitude(cid:9) curve
should have a higher rate of decend in the first two
seconds and a little less rate of decend thereafter.
•T he altitude curve obtained in Run.22 of Boeing simula—
tor shows similar featureS as incorporated in the
Charts C and D and shown as dotted line. The rate of
decend during . .the first two seconds is about 5100 feet
per minute and thereafter reduced to about 4800 feet
per minute and the average, as notice earlier, works
out to be 4980 feet per minute. For this purpose the
average rate of decend (cid:9) 7500 4..ec.t per- minuteL-l':'en - hy
the Boeing is not being accepted as the same was worked
out on the basis of simulated data as opposed(cid:9) UFDR
data.
The pitch and the bank altitudes in a 'stalled -
condition of the aircraft also suggest that the air—
craft must have been falling freely under gravity.(cid:9) It
would be like a stone falling. If a stone

falls under gravity- from a height of 498 feet, it would
take about 5.6 seconds and its average rate of decend
would be about 5336 feet per minute. The free fall of
stone assumes that a stone is falling in vaccum i.e.
without air.. The presence of air would slightly in-
crease the timings. The fall of the aircraft in the
last few seconds, therefore, can be compared with a
free fall. Having regard to all these facts and, in
particular, the fact of left bank of more than 90
-degrees with nose down and side slip, it is not possi-
ble to accept that the aircraft after time frame 2926
was gaining height. In this view the altitude reading
after time frame 2926, as given in LFDR data, deserves
to be ignored.
In the first 5 touch and go exercises there is
no abnormality. The aircraft had gone to Bangalore and
flew back from Bangalore to Delhi and the CUR dbes not
suggest of any problem. Now let us consider why cer-
tain calls other than normal and routine calls, as
reflected in CUR, were made and what we can derive
therefrom.
The first call out after touch down and fore
Rotate call is "Ke gal ae yaar chal straight runway
seeda lagana' on UTC time 09:22:58. These call outs
are by Capt.Khurana. The reasons for these call outs_
are not far to seek. Before touch down time 09:19:29
117

till touch down at time frame Och22:55, it appears that
the flight has been very unsteady as is evident from
the following:-
Late on the final turn to capture localiser.
1)
Unsteady in height keeping.
2)
dy on localiser and glide' slope.
31(cid:9) Unstea
4) Trimming poor.
Flaps 30-40 units at the high speed of 170
5)
knots.
Speed going below Bug speed,
6)
The call 'Ke gal ae yaar, chal straight,
runway seeda lagana' can be or account of aforesaid
factors coupled with the fact that the landing was not
of the runway, though it may be,
straight on the centre-
within the permissible limits.
The next call out after rotate call
ing is happening' followed by the call 'let us see what
to do now'. It seems that Capt, Khurana had something
in his mind when(cid:9)
:1-,111s wer,
the EF'R of Engine No.1 immediately after these calls
throws considerable light as to the state of Mind of
Capt. Khurana at that time. When aforesaid calls are
evaluated with the drop' in EF'R of left Engine, it would
appear that probably Capt. Khurana, at that time, was

thinking -nf giving single engine failure simulation.
The static 'value of EPR of left Engine after the call
'Gear up' for about 4 seconds only shows that for
putting the gear up, Capt.Khurana lifted his hand from
throttle lever to the landing gear lever to move it to
'up position and thereafter again started retarding
the throttle.(cid:9) These calls cannot be attributed
suggested by Mr.Mahajan to something being wrong with
the aircraft.(cid:9) Had it been so it would have been
clearly spelt out in CVR. F.urther, if Capt.Khurana had
found something amiss in the aircraft, he would not
have, looking to his long flying experience, thought of
giving emergency exercise to Capt.Vidul Mahajan.
The horn sound was recorded around 30.5 sec-
onds from the touch down. It is evident that the
•
trainee pilot had not used,the rudder. The horn sound
was on account of unsafe landing configration when Flap
position was 15 and the gear was not down and one
throttle had been retarded. Immediately after the horn
sound, within 3 seconds Capt.Khurana shout= "Rudder,
Rudder, Rudder". He does not tell the traihee pilot fo
which rudder. The aircraft was already rolling
apply
to the left gradually and after the call(cid:9) Na, Na,
Leave, Leave', the rate of roll had increased sharply
as noticed above.(cid:9) The maximum roll was about 100
degrees. In this state of affairs it appears that the
trainee pilof instead ofapplying the right rudder,
119

lapnlied the left rudder with t'he result-that the rate
of roll sharply increased invitino the call from Khura-
na "Na, Na. Leave, Leave between time frame 2924 and
2925 and stick shaker warning at time frame 2928.(cid:9) The
roll showed an. improvement and was reduced to about 60
degrees on frame No. 2930. This. shows that an attempt
was made to recover the aircraft but on account of the -
height, abnormal altitude of the aircraft, and rate of
decend, the recovery was not possible and ultimately
the unfrotunate crash took place.
The slight increase in the EPR of Engine No.1
towards the end only indicates that with a view to
avoid crash throttle may have been moved forward about
2 to 3 seconds earlier.
Now let us consider the effect of absence of
certain calls in CVR at the relevant phase of the r.
flight. As=.umind, the drop. in EFR value of Engine No.1
was on account of Fuel starvation and not on account of
throttle retardation, then it is inconceivable that
Capt.Khurana would not notice the fall in EPR value and
its effect--..(cid:9) He would have(cid:9) in that eventuality,
immediately noticed the, ;raw and the left bank when the
EPR started falling in the first four seconds.(cid:9) The
natural reaction of Capt.Khurana would be to immediate-
ly react and utter words to the effect which would show
12c.f,

(cid:9)
the failure of the engine on account of some defect in
thg, functioning of the Fuel Control Unit- or- any other
part of the aircraft. In that event Capt.Khurana would
have immediately taken control and would not have left
it to the trainee pilot. It is not possible to accept
that till horn sound which was at Frame No.2919 i.e.
after about 11 seconds after the EPR of Engine No.1
started droppind, Capt.Khurana would not not ice the
failure of the engine. Further, assuming that
(cid:9)
Capt.Khurana noticed only on the horn sound that on
-
account of defect of some part of the aircraft, EPR of
Engine No.1 is dropping and that engine had failed, he
Would have immediately taken control and it would have
been reflected in calls recorded on CVR.(cid:9) Capt.Khurana
would not have left it to the trainee to take the
corrective measures. All these factors show that it
.was not a case of engine failure or-defect of any part
or fuel starvation but, knowingly and consciously,
Capt.Khurana gave sinole engine failure simulation to •
trainee pilot Vidl(cid:9) who did not apply the
correct techniques to control the aircraft and rather,
in panic or out of confusion, applied wrong rudder
aggravating the situation and the aircraft was placed
in such position that it was not possible to avoid the
crash.
The Run No.13 of Ex.4 which shows the . flying
exercise on Engineering simulator of Boeing, matches
121

very closely to the parameters of the accident in
question. As noticed above, the aircraft attained the
maximum height' of 49B feet above ground level.(cid:9) There
cannot be any dispute about this fact. Apart from the
exercises reflected in Ex.:}, the exercises carried out
on simulators at British Calidonian as also at Indian
Airlines facilities at Hyderabad, with their instructor-
on the controlsc show that the application of the wrong
rudder is fatal at the height of 500 -Feet above ground
level with the given roll and pitch angle.(cid:9) These
exercise have shown that recovery in such situation is
not possible. With given parameters of roll angle and
pitch value, these exercises have shown, that recovery
on engine failure at the height of even about 1000 feet
above ground level, on the application of the wrong
rudder, is mostly not possible. The application of the
left rudder by the trainee pilot was,therefore, fatal.
The next aspect to be considered is whether.
in the given facts and circumstances, it w,=1=. advisable
to give single engine failure exFn-ci=.e.(cid:9) For this
purpose, let u,=- =.sr.e the experience of training pilots.
EXPERIENCE AND TRAINING OF THREE TRAINEE PILOTS.
As to what training the three training pilot s
had in simulator before going to actual aircraft -for
122

(cid:9)
training, could have been appropriately .e, amined
(cid:9)
perusal of their training record on simulator trathine!
1
at British Calidonian, HK. The said record has,howev-
er, not come forth. The record is said to have been
burnt in the accident. Though three conies of
training record are prepared but all these copiee, are
stated to have been contained in one booklet and,. the
said booklets, it has come in evidence, were with the
concerned trainee pilots at the time of the LF,,!,,,h. One
copy of the training record was meant forthe trainee
pilot; one for the airline operator and another for the
regulatory body.(cid:9) None has been made available.(cid:9) In
absence of that record necessarily this court had to
fall back upon the record 0+ training kept in unoffi-
cial diary maintained by Capt.Rao who had imparted
simulator training to these trainees as instructor in
British fl.Rledonian. The record from British Calidonian
could not be obtained since it was stated that only
simulators were hired and the Calidonian was not con-
cerned with ..1±(cid:9) imparted and had not
maintained.any rer-nrfl.
As per personal diary of Capt.Rao the perform-
P",(cid:9) ance of trainee pilots specially on single engine was
not upto the mark, the rudder trimming was(cid:9) r and
they use to forget stab trim and get panicky. Capt.Rao
has said that the trainees had lot of problems on
r-(cid:9) rudder trimming when he introduced them to single
r-N
123

engine exercise.(cid:9) Capt.Rao has tried to explain that
after vigorous training, they learnt procedure and art
of trimming on the rudder and they were found satisfac-
tory with .their existing experience and were released
for the check. The cockpit procedure training was not
given to the trainees since it was 'said to be expensive
and was also not required as ttle trainees were holding
Commercial Pilot Licence with instrument rating.(cid:9) Here
I may mention one related aspect and that is about
Mr.Rao's rating as instructor. Capt.Rao had been
permitted by DGCA to act as an instructor on simulator.
That was,however, subject to Capt.Rao going through
training and as mentioned in th=. letter of DRflA dated
9th December 1993 (Ex.23), after going throuqh- the
refresher course.(cid:9) Mr.Rao states that he underwent
simulator training, as stipulated in Ex 23 (cid:9) under an
approved instructor on 14th December 1993 and on the
same date the release check by DGCA approved examiner
was also conducted on him. This release check of
after he
Capt.Rao by an approved instructor was
imparted training to trainee pilot Mr.P.Sinoh on 14th
December 1993. Capt.Rao states that since he had not

finished his own training and check on

Slot was already allotted

with his past experience as instructor. Capt.Rao says
_that he had expressed his unwillingness to the boys but
upon their insistence, he decided to commence the.
training. Capt.P.Singh and Capt.Tripathi were the
first batch of trainee pilots under instructione. of
Capt.Rao after he left Indian Airlines which was about
two years earlier, Undoubtedly the training on Simula-
r.
tor is very expensive. Capt.Rao states that in view of
huge expense, the earlier the training finiPhe.s. it is
better for the trainee pilots since each trainee pilot
has not only to make payment of about Rs.3 lakhs to th e
British Calidonian but has also to make some payment to
the instructor. In this case Capt.Rao who is said to
have taken the jot of acting as instructor on simulator
on honorary basis. As per Capt.Rao he was not main-
taining any personal log book except making entries in
the personal diary as noticed hereinbefore.(cid:9) One can
understand the huge dxpense involved in training which
trainee pilots, but keep-
has to be borne by the young
ing in view the highest standard of safety measures
which are necessary'in these matters, too much impor-
tance to the expense part is not justified'(cid:9) On this

aspeCt I will only say this and leave it at that with
out saying, anything more.

The training etc undergone- by the three pilots
before going in for their simulator training at British
Calidonian has already been set out in the earlier part
of this report. Even the contents of the personal
diary kept by Capt.Rao show that the performance of the
trainee pilots was not of a very high standard.(cid:9) But
for the unfortunate crash during which all the three
trainee pilots lost their lives, they would have after
completion of the said flight, gone for -Feet flights.
with a DGCA approved examiner and on satisfactory
performance in the said check (C' 40A Cheek) their
papers would have been sent for endorsement to DGCA tor
their acting as co-pilot on Boeing aircraft.(cid:9) On ob-
taining necessary endorsement, they could have been
eligible to be released as co-pilots. Let us see the
training imparted before one is released to act as co-
pilot by Indian Airlines. The training imparted

the. .present case, the trainees were on the very
first day, put on aircraft, with an instructor who had
not himself imparted simulator training to, the train-
ees, and then a single engine failure exercise was
given and that too when the performance of trainees on
simulator was not of very high standard. The giving of
such exercise was certainly nbt advisable and a prudent
act.(cid:9) But for this exercise, the crash was avoidable.
Capt.Tripathi- says that by way of abundant caution he
had briefed Capt.Khurana not to undertake any emergency
exercises 'in the training fl.i/ght.(cid:9) How much can
Capt.Tripathi be relied upon on /this particular aspect

is another matter which would be dealt with at its
appropriate stage in later part of this report but his
statement that if Capt.Khurana was planning to do
single engine failure, it should have been done on the
down wind so that in case of an error the same could
have been safely rectified, deserves due weightage, not
only because the statement is coming from a highly
experienced person but also for the reason that this
seems to be even otherwise generally accepted position
which
emerges from opinion of most of the,
pilots, and
there is hardly any contrary opinion.(cid:9)
tapt.Tripathi
alSo says that looking at the level of the
experience
of the trainee, Capt.Khurana should have guar'ded the
control lest it is interfered with inadvertently by the
trainee pilot. There cannot be any doubt that while
giving single -engine :failure, on the- given facts,
Capt.Khurana should have blocked the rudder control so
that the trainee pilot does not apply the wrong rudder.
',therefore, conclude that, in the present
case, in the first instance, the single engine failure
exercise should not have been given. In any case, it
should have been given on down wind'in normal circuit.
Further, even- when it. was given on take off, at the
altitude at which it was given, Capt.Khurana should
have rocked the rudder so as to rule out the possibil-
ity c f application of wrong rudder by the trainee.

REGULATORY AND CONTRL(cid:9)
TIONS OF DGCA NAA AND IAAI
The modern a'i rcraft systems and operating
procedures are generally failure tolerent and exhibit
sufficient redundency and safeguards to cope adequately
with engine failure-be it human or mechanical- The
greater risk is the organisational failure. The seri-
ous incident or accident is mord often than not a
symptom of the failure somewhere in the system.(cid:9)
The
failures may take place by mistake- indeed most hazard-
ous errors will involve the violation of. some opera-
tional rule. or instructions. But violations can also
be deliberate and in this case the reason can surely be
found in the corporate management- commercial pressures
on flight crew and lack of care and supervision being
obvious motivator( See paper presented by Hong Kong in
the Conference of Directors General of Civil Aviation,
Asia and Pacific Region held at Pinang, Malaysia from
8th to 14th September 1994).
As stated earlier, the aspects including that
of failure of management and regulatory body would be
examined and dealt with under this head. I would first
.examine and deal with the matter of grant of approval
for Capt.Khurana to act as instructor and the role of
Sahara and DGCA in this respect.
130

APPROVAL OF KHURANA AS INSTRUCTOR
No.
Capt.P.Khurana was said to have been granted
approval to act as instructor vide letter of DGCA dated
8th March 1994 -
The original letter dated 8th March
1994 alleged to have been sent by DGCA to Sahara'has not
seen the light of the day. The evidence of Witness
No.2 Capt.V.N.Arora in this regard is contradictory and
unconvincing.(cid:9)
The DOCA has also not been-
able to
explain and clarify as to when that letter was in fact
despatched by their
office to Sahara. In any case, it
is clear and rather admitted that the' said letter did
not leave office of DGCA'before crash.
The approval of DOCA was sought for
Capt.Khurana as an instructor vide letter of Sahara
dated 28th February 1994(Ex.8). This letter was sent
by Capt.Arora. .Capt.Arora states that he had telephon-
ic conversation with Mr.J.K.Sardana, Director of Train-
ing and Licensing in the office of DGCA on 7th March
1994 and Mr.Sardana told him that approval for
Mr.Khurana to act as an instructor is being granted and
he can go ahead with the training flight. Capt.Khurana
joined the services of Sahara on 3rd November 1993.
Before that he was in employment with M/s.Modiluft.
Capt.Khurana -was not cleared as an instructor when he
left Modiluft. Sahara had not conducted any test and
131

(cid:9)
training fler Capt.Khurana as an instructor.
Capt.Khurana_was approved as Check Pilot vide letter of
DGCA dated 24th December 1993 and was cleared to per-
form the duties of check pilots vide DGCA's letter
dated - 16th January 1994. He had not been cleared as
check pilot prior to 18th January 1994 in any other
Airlines.(cid:9) Capt.Arora states that experience of
Capt.Khurana as check pilot can be counted only from
16th January 1994. Capt.Arora also agrees that
(cid:9) Capt.Khurana did not fulfill condition of sub clause
4.
(iv) of Clause 2.2 of Ex.9, namely, Criteria for Ap-
q proval of. Examiners/Instructors/Check.filots for Air-
line Operations on fixed wing Aircraft.(cid:9) He admitted
.that Capt.Khurana neither had the experience of one
year as approved check pilot on the type nor the expe-
,
(cid:9)
rience 50 hours as approved instructor on another
type Of aircraft. -Admittedly, it was in the knowledge
of Capt.Arora that Capt. Khurana did not fulfill the
conditions necessary when he sent letter dated 28th
February 1994 seeking approval for Capt.Khurana to act
as an instructor. Inspite of this knowledge Capt.Arora
stated in his letter that Capt.Khurana had completed
all the formalities.(cid:9) Since the letter dated 28th
February 1994 was written knowing that Capt.Khurana was
not eligible to act as an instructor a pointed question
was asked to Capt.Arora that, did he write that letter
on his own account or he wrote it because his employer
wanted him to write such a letter. The demeanour of
132

the' witness while answering this question deserves to
be noticed. Capt.Arora after taking considerable time
in answering this question and even thereafter, with
lot of hesitation, took the burden(cid:9) writing the
letter onto himself and absolved his employer.
Capt.Arora is still in the employment of Sahara.(cid:9) The
reasons for his aforesaid answer are not far to si=ek.
Capt.Arora said that although he knew that Capt.Khurana
lacked the experience as per criteria but he wrote the
said letter and stated in that letter that Capt.Khurana
had completed all the formalities since there was a
requirement of atleast one instructor for Sahara and
the Airline had no instructor. When asked as to wheth-
er he. had reported about what he had stated in letter
dated 28th February 1994 to his senior executive in the
company, namely, Mr.Uttam Kumar Bose, firstly with
hesitation -Capt.Arora stated that he had reported that
to Mr.Bose but agaih changed stating that he ha.d not
reported it to Mr.Bose and it was purely his own deci-
sion.
AIC 13/93(Ex.9) sets out the following re-
quirement of flying experience for grant of approval of
Pilot as instructor in Clause 2.2. It reads:
INSTRUCTOR
I) Total Flying experience(cid:9) ; 3500/hours
133

comMani experience(cid:9) : 1500 hours
iii)Total command experience on
(cid:9) 1000 hours
type.
iv) Experience as approved
Check pilot on the type'(cid:9) One year
OR
Experience as approved
instructor on another
type of aircraft.(cid:9) 50 hours.
Capt.Khurana though was approved as check
pilot for the first time on 7th April 1992 while he was
working in Indian Airlines, he did not undergo training
after
or test with Indian Airlines as Check pilot.
approval dated 7th April 1992. He proceeded on leave
from 16th May 1992 to 6th June 1992 and was available
after 6th June 1992 and was subsequently taken up for
Aircraft A 320 Course on 8th June 1992 and discontinued
it on -7th July 1992. Capt.Khurana left the services of
Indian Airlines thereafter and admittedly he was nei-.
ther appointed/released nor acted as check pilot prior
to 18th January, 1994. He was also not appointed as
check pilot while working with Modiluft. For the first
time he was appointed as a check pilot was afti2r grant
of approval by DGCA vide its letter dated 4th December
Capt.Khurana Kass released ty Saharaes a check
1993.(cid:9)
pifot on issue of letter dated 16th January 19':::4 by
(cid:9) As already(cid:9) noticed
D CA as referred to above.
134

Capt.Khurana, according. to Capt.Arora did not fulfill
the aforesaid condition-of---experience-of-one year as.
check pilot witness No.5 Mr.J.K.Sardana who is the
Director of Training and Licensing in DGCA, says that
Capt.Khurana fulfilled condition No.4' f clause
Ex.9 and had experience as an approved check pilot of
one year. This he says because Capt.Khurana was ap-
proved as check pilot for the.first time on 7th April
1992 while he was in Indian Airlines. According to the
testimony of Mr.Sardana, the period of one year would
start from 7th April 1992. Mr.Sardana also states that
in case of grant of approval to Capt.Khurana to act as
an -instructor, power.of relaxation was not exercised.
According to Mr.Sardana the experience of one year
after approva,1 as check pilot is sufficient even though
the concerned pilot may not have acted as check pilot
(cid:9) Mr.Sardana further states,.: that period of one .
at
counted even if a pilot is not eligible
year could. be
to act as a check pilot. Capt.Arora has not talked
about relaxation. The letter dated 28th February' 1994
also does not state that approval in case of
Capt:Khurana was sought in relaxation of rules with
regard to experience as check pilot.(cid:9) Capt. Tripathi
also admits that he was aware that Capt.Khurana's
experience as a route check pilot was not of one year V
and as such he was not fulfilling the retirement
E7-7
2.2(4) of Ex..9. Capt.Tripathi,however, says that
135

1
Department of Civil Aviation can waive this condition.
ETYstept for Capt.Tripathi no one has talked about waiver
or relaxation of condition regarding experience of one
year as check pilot. It has also come on record that
upto 28th February 1994 when the letter seeking approv-
al was sent, Capt.Khurana had:
onducted only two checks
though the DGCA was informed that he had conducted 6
checks(cid:9) Later, after the accident Sahara said that he
had conducted 4 checks. Even out of these four checks,
admittedly two checks were conductred after 28th Febru-
ary 1994.(cid:9) DOCA_could not be aware about these two
checks when it granted approval on file on 4th March
1994.(cid:9) One check was on 4th March 1994 and another on
5th March 1994. After his release as check pilot the
'only two checks conducted by Capt.Khurana befor* send-
ing letter dated 28th February 1994 were two, namely,
on 25th January 1994 i.e. of Capt.S.C.Tripathi, and on
28th January 1994 of Capt.A.K.Chadha. It is strange
that Sahara informed DGCA that Capt.Khurana had con-
ducted six checks. The DGCA should have also cross
checked.
According to Mr.Sardana it is immaterial
whether during the period of one year, the check pilot
exercises the privileges of Check pilot or not and on
the same analogy it would also be immaterial if after
grant of _approval for one year or for a substantial
part thereof the pilot remains sick or does not fly at
136

all for any other reason and still as per the under-
--standing of the Department, he would fulfill the condi-
tion of one year experience of check pilot as contem-,
plated by clause 2.2(4) of Ex.9. This understanding of
Mr.Sardana and of the Department, to say the least, is
absolutely against not only the plain language of the
clause requiring experience but(cid:9)
against tree
object and purpose of the clause. In the hierarchy of
fliers the position of instructor is very vital and
important.(cid:9)
The instructor has to teach flying.
'suppose with a purpose it must have been stipulated
. that a check pilot with experience as check pilot of
one year, would be eligible to be considered for grant
of approval as instructor. It implies that one has to
exercise privileges of a check pilot before being
considered for approval as instructor.(cid:9)
According to
• the (cid:9) of the Department as disclosed by
Mr.Sardana a pilot - would be said to be fulfilling
Clause 2.2(4) after approval of DGCA even though he is
not released/appointed as check pilot by the Airline
and even though he is not flying at all for one reason
or'the Other. Such an understanding did not even; finn
favour with the fliers as is evident from the testimony
of Capt.Arora and Capt.Tripathi.
During the pendency, f these proceedings by
issue AIC dated 5th December 1994 requireme / n t of
137

clause 2.2 has been changed in regard to the experience
as.. check pilot. The existing clause of experience
one year as check pilot has been withdrawn and in its
place the requirement of 10 checks has been provided
(cid:9)
`for. The AIC now issued does not now stipulate any
experience as check pilot before one can be considered
for approval as instructor. This has its own fallout=.
It is appropriate•that now it has been provided that a
check pilot should have conducted 10 checks before he
is considered eligible for approval as instructor.(cid:9) In
view of the fact that in a given circumstance. 10
checks can be completed•in short span of even 2-3 days,
it may not be proper to completely do away with experi-
ence. It would be desirable to combine both the period
of experience and requisite number of checks.(cid:9) Keeping
in view the safety required in aviation matters doing
away with one year experience does not appear to be
appropriate.
There is also another aspect of approval of
Capt.Khurana as instructor. Admittedly, Capt.Khurana
did not receive any training for instructorship with
Sahara.(cid:9) It was all done with Modiluft.(cid:9) Regarding
period of one year experience of check pilot of
Mr.Khurana, Mr.Sardana says that:-
"It is true that any approval as examiner /
instructor / check pilot is valid only .till
such time the officer remair/s with the
138

gttl(cid:9)
is correctthaf
approval granted to Capt.Khurana to act ae
check pilot on 7th April, 1992
reaeed to he
valid after he left the said airlines.
Capt.Khurana was not approved check
pi 10
while working with East WestAirlines.
would be correct (cid:9) If
to state that experience nf
Capt.Khurana aea flier, While he was in
employment with East WestAirlines, wnhld not
be counted as check pilot, since he was not a
check pilot while working with the said
airlines. Capt.Khurana was approved as check
pilot, vide letter dated 9.9.93, while he was
working with Modiluft. Counting the period
after 7th April, 1992 till Capt.Khurana left
the employment with Indian Airline, and
adding to it his experience as
flier after
9th September, 1997 till 8th March, 1994,
would not make upto one year experience as
check pilot."
The training of Modiluft requires the line-
student training under supervision before the release
of an officer as an instructor. Mr.Sardana admits that
on the file there is nothing to show that prior to
approval dated 8th March 1994 Capt.Khurana had done
line-
student training under supervision but says that
Khurana had orally told him about it.
(cid:9) Mr.Sardana
says:-.1s1
"On the file there is nothing to show that
prior to approval dated 8th March 1994
Capt,kh!!rana had done line student train-
inc Under supervisinn. Mr.Khdrana had,
however,orally told me about it."
I fail to understand how approval could be accorded by
IDSCA on the basis of what Khurana told Mr.Sardana
orally and the same not having been placed on 1
-ecord.
(cid:9)
Mr.Sardana
say= that when DBE q, anted approval to
Capt.Khurana to act as instn_=tcJr, the department did
not know as to what was the syllabus for necessary
139

training and satisfactory tests of Sahara.
Further, Witness No.9' Capt.P.Kling who is a
Senior Vice-
Presijent(Operations) in Modiluft has
explained that in their Airline before an instructor is
permitted to exercise the privileges as instructor, he
is required to undergo line-student training under
supervision.(cid:9) In line-s!tdent
training Crew Resource
Management/Crew f7nordin.st on Concept ac Check Captain
is requireed to be done. The number o f surh li
ne_
student training checks varies depending upon the
performance of the concerned pilot. .On an average
trainee instructor is required to undergo 10 such
checks.(cid:9)
Capt.Khurana had not undergone line-student
training checks under supervision and had he been in
employment of Modiluft he would not have been released
as ins
tructor without the completion of the said
checks.
Capt.Khurana was cleared to perform the duties
as Check Pilot for Boeing 737-200
Aircraft for Sahara
by. Witness Nr1.10 r>pt.Vinnd Mahajan who is an Inspector
of Flying with DSCA. Mr.Sardana has stated that such
clearance was not necessary.The clearance was given
under the signatures of Capt.Mahajan vide letter dated
18th January 1994 of DGCA, Cipt.Mahajan =.taLes tha
t
neither this letter was necessary nor was he authorised
to write that letter on bhll' of the DGrA.
(cid:9) that-
sp, it remains unexplained, as to why letter dated 18th
January 1994 was issued by n pt.Mahaian on behalf of
140

DGCA.
Further according to Mr.Sardana the necessary
training and satisfactory test under clause 1.6 in
regard to an instructor can either be before-grant of
approval of DGCA or after grant of such approval.
(cid:9) In
case the necessary training and satisfactory tests are -
conducted after such approval, according to the under-
standing of Mr.Sardana, it is not necessary for the
Operator to report to the DGCA that the concerned
officer had completed the necessary training and passed
the tests satisfactorily. These matters have been left
to the good sense of the operator to comply with.
It
is not a happy state of affairs. The regulatory body
should ensure that the concerned officer has undergone
the necessary training and pass the tests satisfactori-
ly.(cid:9)
The regulatory body should also lay down minimum
traihing requirement which factor is absent in the AIC
13 of 1993. AIC 13 of 1993 has since been amended on
5th December 1994 now stipulating that the pilot has to
undergo necessary training and pass the tests satisfac-
torily before approval of DGCA for a pilot to act as an
instructor is sought. This is a welcome change in the
AIC but more is required to be done by providing mini-
mum training programme.
Mr.Sardana is not a pilot. He is not as=.ori-
ated with flying. He is a Telecommunication Engineer..
141

when papers are submitted for seeking approval of pilot
either as a check pilot or instructor or examiner tr,
DGCA, normally the same are not required to be
rirkc,
r discrutinised by any pilot. The same is the case
of endorsement-
as co-pilot. Keeping in view that
flying is a specialised subiectiarf, it
(cid:9)
necessary
that ordinarily'a person with good flying experienme
and backaround should be aissociatd in
(cid:9)
nf
such approvals.
In letter dated eth February 1994 addressed to
Indian Airlines it was stated that newly inducted
instructor had to be checked by DGCA Flight Inspector
before they are assigned
-
to impart instruction.
Mr.Sardana states that it was erroneously stated but
that letter was not withdrawn because regulations are a
dynamic process and Department keeps on adding or
deleting from it from time to time and Department
- may
be contemplating a similar procedure and that is why
letter dated 8th Fibru--Iry 1994(cid:9)
not withdrawn.
I may state that in India till the recent
_changeover primarily there were only two Airlines,
name
ly, Indian Airlines and Air India. Both are gov-
ernment controlled organisations. Wi
4-h fh$= rerent
change and 'open skies' policy various privat
(cid:9) opera-
tors have come into the Jield. In view of the changec:
142

condition, tVie responsibility on the shoulders of '`DGCA
— •
-is greater. Mr.Sardana states that the Operators are
not required to obtain approval of DGCA for thi=ir
Training Manual. It is only required to be submitted
to DGCA.(cid:9) I am informed .that durino the pendency of
these proceedings necessary circular requiring approval
of DGCA for Training Manual has been issued. It is- re
duired to be noticed that though DGCA granted approval
on 4th March/Bth March 1994 it did not know as to what
was the syllabus for necessary training and satisfacto—
ry test of Sahara for their instructor. It was not a
happy state of affair but nothing more is required to
be said now since after the accident Sahara submitted
their Training Manual sometime in May 1994 which has
since been approved.
Capt.Khurana had moved on fromione Airlines to
another in last two years.. After leaving Indian Air—
.
lines in 1992 he itined East West(cid:9) *1-11-1
left
East West Airlines add joined Mhdl!!ff and finally
Sahara on 3rd November 1993. Though DEICA had granted
approval for. Capt. Khurana to act as a Check pilot in
Indian Airlines but before he could be given necessary
training and perform the +unctions of Check Pilot, he
•
left the services pi= the said Airlines.(cid:9) Admittedly,
Capt.Khurana did n,-t act as a check pilot either in
Indian Airlines or in Ea,‘. West or in Modilu-ft. He was.
143

_
.released as a check.: pilot for the
4 r.,..i- time(cid:9)
Eahara
on 18th January 195'4. Admittedly,according to Sahara.
Capt.Khurana did not fulfill tne condition of Cia4se
2.2(iv) of one year experi
,,,,nc,=,
as check pilot neceary
for grant ofapproval to act as instructor.
Capt.Khurana in term=-
. of the rritRria applicable was
not eligible for grant of approval as l!fr!tr-for.
CONDUCT OF SAHARA
As stated earlier, now there is greater re-
sponsibility onthgr,(cid:9)
Dr;r7A. At
the same
time there is also great
r
esponsibility.on the opera-
tors.
The conduct of Sahara throughout shows that they•
have not acted with responsibility. The facts whirh
have come to light in these proceedings show that the
conduct of Sahara has been deplorable before the crash
in the matter of planning training flight in question
and seeking approval Of DEICA for Mr.Khurana as instruc-
tor.(cid:9)
It has also been deplorable immediatelyafter
crash and also during the course of these_proceedings.
Sahara should have thoroughly scrutinised the
training papers of the trainee pilots and preserved the
record before plannind the trainee flight.
(cid:9)
All the
three copies of record of simulator training at Pr
(cid:9)itic-, h
Calidonian should not havebeen handed over to the
concerned trainees.(cid:9)
This action has deprived this
144

court the advantage of the perusal of the said record.
In =to far as Sahara is concerned as it evident
from the testimony of both Capt.Arora and Capt.Tripa—
thi, Capt.Khurana was not eligible for approval
(cid:9) •
instructor since he lacked experience of one year as a
check pilot. Therefore, Sahara had no justification
whatsoever to state that Capt.Khurana fulfilled all the
conditions when admittedly it was not so. It is not
very material whether Capt.Arora wrote that Capt.Khura—
na fulfilled all the conditions on his own in his
letter dated 28th February 1994 or on the asking of his
employer.(cid:9)
Assuming that he wrote on his own then too
Sahara cannot be absolved of the responsibility since
Capt.Arora was their agent and representative.
(cid:9) It
is,however, difficult to comprehend and believe that
Capt.Arora wrote that letter on his own.
(cid:9)
Probably
Capt.Arora has taken the burden on himself with a view —
to save the embarrasement to his higher ups and the
employer. The DRCA may have power of relaxation but it
was nobOdy's case that approval of Capt.Khurana a=
instructor was =ought in(cid:9)
the said power 0-F
relaxation.(cid:9)
The power of relaxation is also not a
blanket power. In case one seeks the exercise of power
of relaxation it is to be stated that in what respect
and /for which parameter- re,
laatidn js being sought.
The regulatory body has also to place on record the
145

(cid:9)
reasons srnowing application of mind for grant of such
relaxation.(cid:9)
Mr.Bardana has deposed that Capt.Khurana
was notgranted apbroval in relaxation of any require-
menf.
Further, r
apt.Kh!trana had not undertaken any
training or test necessary -o r per.'ormino the privi-
leges of instructor while he was with Sahara.
(cid:9)
He is
stated to have given certai!T dhcumenta about such
training when he was in Mogiluft. Sahara should have
checked up with M/s.Modiluft whether rapf.Khurana had
undertaken full training as per the requirement rf
their Airlines for exercising the privileges of in-
structor instead of at!--aightaway relying upon what was
stated by Capt.Khurana.
Another
aspect that desrvs to be noticed is
a note at the bottom of office note dated 7th March,
1994 to the effect that "confirmed by DTI teliaphonical
ly that Capt.Fj5hurana is cleared B 737-200 as instruc-
tor, letter will follow.' This note iS in the hand of
one Mr.G.K.Luthra and has been initialled by
Capt.Arora. It is nobody , case that Mr.Luthra had any
talk with Mr.Bardana. Why this
(cid:9)
necess' ary to
be appended on Arm,7,x(cid:9)
something which
could not
be explained by Sahara. it ia a curious note.
/ (cid:9) There
was no occasion for Mr.Luthra to make that note. There
Was no occasion for flapt.Arnra to initial that note.
146
• • (cid:9) •

It seems that it was made after-sthe crash. Who could
be interested in creating such a evidence except the
employer.
Even -after-
the-accident and also during the
course of the inquiry the conduct of the Airlines has
not been straight forward. It is evident that Sahara
made up its mind that it was a case of simulated engine-
fl
failure as early as on 9th March 1994 when an insertion
in newspaper EX15 was given jUstifying that such an
exercise was necessary. The point is not whether such
-an exercise -was necessary or not. For the present,
the point is, that having taken that position Sahara
should have been straight forward in its stand.
(cid:9) In-
stead of doing that, they took absolute converse stand
in these proceedings to the effect that Capt.(hurana
was briefed by Capt. Tripathi in the presence
(cid:9) of
Capt.Arora that no emergency exercise should be given
during the course of the training flight. This stand
assumes such an exercise was not necessary. To justify
that stand further and having been confronted with
Ex. 15, Sahara came -
Forward with escape route in the
form of evidence of witness Mr.A.K.Ohri. His testimony
is
utterly unconvincino and not at all reliable. • It
is
in,-
rmcg.iveabl!= that Ex.15 would have been given without
consulting Officers like Capt. Arora and Capt. Tripathi
d
other senor officers and in fact on the in-struc-
147

Lions of such officers. In view of the totality of
these circumstances it is also not conceivable that
Capt.rhurana wa= briefed not to give any emergency
exercise in the training flight.
In this F-
.=1, as is ,,,,piparent from aforeir4,
the lack of proper corporate management seems evident
when one bears in mind the manner in which the approval
of DGCA for Capt.Khurana to act as instructor was
sought and the manner in which the training flight was
planned and executed before,even receipt of formal
approval from DGCA. Commercial pressure also is evi-
dent from the testimony of Capt.Arera when he says that
the Airline was in the need of an instructor and that
is the reason that he made application for his approval
knowing well that Capt.Khurana was not eligible. It i=
not possible to accept though he has taken the burden
on himself to believe that he did it without the knowl-
edge, consent or at the instance of his superiors.
In the newspapers of lath March 1994 the'
advertisement Ex.15 issued by Sahara was published
which suggests that an engine failure exercise was given
in the training
flight in question with a view to
give
out that such(cid:9) pe
of typical, dynamic training exer-
cises were mandatory requirement by the statutory
authorities..(cid:9)
This advertisement came to light only
148

when - evidence was being recorded. (cid:9) The advertisement
was brought on record during the cross examination of
Mr.S.Krishnan on- 15th November 1794. Mr-.Krishnan,
however, stated that he could not say who gave the
insertion Ex.15 in the newspaper.(cid:9)
The witness was
directed on 15th November 1994 to place on record the
basis on which Ex.15 was given in the newspaper.
(cid:9) Thi=
led to filing of affidavit dated 22nd November 1994 by
Witness No.12 Mr.Ashok Kumar Ohri who is Incharge for
•
all media releases on behalf of the Company. He is not
'an expert in flying. In fact, he does not know any-
- thing about flying and also much about the requirement
of DGCA. He has taken upon himself the entire burden
of issue of Ex.15. This document,inter-alia, gives an
,impression that power of one engine had been reduced to
zero in the ill-fated flight and Sahara knew about it
on 8th fir,h,
1994 and also that such an exercise was
.necessary.(cid:9)
When asked as to how he reached the said
conclusion, =tn utterly unHonvinHinn and unsatisfactory
reply was given that when he had gone to Airport on 8th
March 1994, he overheard certain people saying that the
power of one engine had been reduced to zero and
is how he stated about reduction of power in the Pr
,=-,-=.
release and he did not discuss about it with either
Capt.Arora or Capt.Tripathi or any other person in
Sahara about the reduction tf power(cid:9) one ,f the pr,
genes.(cid:9) He is said to have -ter=?r1 sco jlded by Mr.Uff=tm
149

remember
he(cid:9) h,„
overheard talking about reduction
of the power. I+ is
inconceivable +h=+ in an insertion in the newspaper-
about the power of one engine having been reduced to
zero would be given without the knowledge of the Senior
Pilht= end the senior executives working in Sahar,R.
wish that advertisement being a vital document would
have been collected by Inspector of Accidents and
placed on record and mentioned in his report instead of
the same being brought on record by Mr.Mahajan appear—
ing for Mrs.Khurana. Be that as it may, this insertion
shows that Sahara had made up the mind soon after the
accident that it was a case of simulatio n of engine
failure by the ins+rucfor and that it
necessary
requirement of training stipulated by the statutory
authorities and as such there was nothing wrong in the
said exercise.(cid:9) If it Was(cid:9) the q..4.WarP, should have
taken that stand. It is also a pointer to the fact
tiat the stand of Sahara that Capt.Khurana
not-- to givE emergency(cid:9) trainee pilots
T. is
lso not correct.(cid:9) That being the position Sahara
should nof(cid:9) tain the s_and aboUL the briEfing
Capt.Khurana not to give emergency exercises, the
stand, with which they pers .=:+ed. Even otherwi se
stand does not seem to be correr-f. (cid:9) At best it cr..;..n (cid:9) ..„=„

if he considers necessar he can give to the trainee
:I 50

D-Lherwise,it
(cid:9)
seems dif icult
accept as to why, on hi=
, own,
Capt.Khurana would give such a exercise contras-Y
, to his
briefing, more so, when it has come on record that
Capt.Khurana had earlier never violated the specific
instructions given to him by his seniors. It is,howev-
alfooe.!-her a different matt'(cid:9)
whether Capt.Khurana
should have given single engine exercie.e tn the trainee
p
ilots or not keeping in view the experience and record
of performance nf trainee on c-,imulator
and other
aspects which have been earlier noticed or if at all it
should not have been given on take off and should have
been given, in any case, on down wind in normal rirruit
and further, in the given poedtion, Capt.Kh
otrana ehnH1H
have anticipated that trainee may apply a wrong rudder
and bearing in mind its lethal effect, he should have
blocked the right rudder so that the trainee could only
apply right rudder and the instructor should have also
not waited for long when the trainee did not apply the
rudder and should have taken over the controls.
ROLE OF DGCA
e.tated earlier, with the present 'Open
Skies Policy- (cid:9) th2 bur7len on 4-he shoulders of filF-
-1
regulatory body like ID_:CF is greater. Prior to th
e..:
present policy, primarily there were only two operators..
151

in the field of Civil Aviation, namely, Indian Airlin
es
and A-ir India, both 2,overnment contolled organisations
and in t,le very nature of things, the commercial con-
siderations wi=re not
as
dominating as may be prevelant
in private operators. The compromise with the safety
standards cannot be allowed because of commercial
considrations.(cid:9)
The regulatory body can, however,
have 'no complusion whatsoever 7=
-or granting such approv-
In this case the understanding of Da
-A of criteria
2.
2(iv) regarding the eligibility conditions for
ap-
proval as instructor is contrary to the plain language
of the criteria. I am surprised at the understanding
of the said requirement of criteria of DGCA when it
takes the stand that experience of one year as check
pilot is required to be taken into consideration from
the date DGCA grants approval in case of a Pilot as
check pilot and it is immaterial whether he performs
the function of check pilot or not.
Even if these
functions are not performed one would still be eligible
to be considered for approval as instructor after lapse
of one year.
When the criteria talks of experience it
pre-supposes
that the offi
cer has performed the func-
tions, during
the said period of one year of a check
pilot. Anything, particularly whe,
-
; that may jeopardise
safe~y, cannot
be left to the goodwill of the Opera'
.tor
(cid:9)
only.
Further, t~e
1--Pdry body is required to
provide light to the Operators by providing some mini-
MUM
uniform standards. If the DISCA had appropriately
152
•

Itnderefonri the criteria it would no+ have
approval ih the case of Capt.Khurana.
(cid:9)
The Indian
Airlines guidelines, referred to above, lays down the
following criteria for a pilot before he is release-eh as
Instructor:-
"5.2.4.2 INSTRUCTORS

153

Sahara, as stated earlier also, had no train-
ing manual. DGCA should have atleast aeked Sahara as
to what was their training manual so that regulatory
body had an opportunity to know whether it was adequate
or not.(cid:9)
DGCA should have also cross checked the facts
before grant of approval of Capt.Khurana as instructor.
Sr,
much about the role of regulatory body.
FIRE FIGHTING OPERATIONS
Preliminary finding was recorded in the Report
.
of Inspector of Accident, on the basis of Group report,
that there was no mobile water replenishment arrange-
ment for the crash fire tenders positioned for fire
fighting, resulting in dislocation of CFTs from
ideel
position to collect water from static tank No. 9 and 11
and *
thus fire fighting operation was carried out in
stages and also that the quality of the produced foam
was not standard and the fire extinguishing media was
not creating required actions o'n the fire and also that
on two CFTs, the monitor controls were unserviceable
and on the other two monitors, controls became unserv-
iceable during fire fighting operations with the result
that side channels for fire fighting were used on
,theee
crash fire tenders.
Firstly it may be noticed that no expert
was/
involved in the Group to study and analyse whether th
-
15--t4

fire fighting opertion was adequate or not. Mr.Cnand-
--
na, Inspector of Accidents, admittegl.,,
was not an
Expert in fire fighting operations.(cid:9) L
ikewise, other
members of the Group were also not aomittenly experts
in fire fighting operations.
.7,eo4.Jiloly, the statements of Assistant Director
or Fire Officer Mr.Mehary who were admittedly
present at the time of +ire fighting operations were not
recorded.
Thirdly, the report containing the aforesaid
deficiencies in fire fighting operation was
submitted
about four months after the accident.
Fourthly, the preliminary findinn
(cid:9) regarding
the poor quality of foam was given but nc investigation
was carried out for checking the quality of foe,-
and
log book though makes detailed entries about other
aspects, there is no mention about poor foam
formation.
Fifthly, one of the crash fire tender ri+ which
the monitor was unserviceable was admittedly being used
as a mobile water tank ,.;rd Thus tne preliminary fin-iinn
that there was no arrangement for water
cannot be sustained.
Before concluding the fire fighting operation -
aspect, reference may also be made to tre
of(cid:9) Witness No.11 Mr.K.M.Ohyan Fire Off.icer v4no was

eth Marol:: 1994 and Nr.6upta witneSs
I
report regarding fire fighting operations is primarily
upon what Mr.Dhyani had stated. From
his testi-
mony if seems that the supply of water on 8th March
1994 was also available from Waterising system. It has
also been explained by witness No.13 Mr. Gupta,Deputy
General Manager (
Equipment & Sports) that wateris_ng
system was undr insf31

,r.
Terminal Building and the work was under execution and
it had reached a s.
Eage where it could be activated

ooration and when need for additional water t.-4
,Rs
felt, this potential was also usi=d.
(cid:9) Rec.:larding the
unsericeahilifw of monitor-=, at crash fi-e tenders as
(cid:9) stated in Fire Fighting Operation Report Ex.7, Nr.Gupta
e",
explained that the monitor of one fire tender (AL
was unserviceable inasmuch
(cid:9) it could not
EDP, used
at all and for that reason the said vehicle was used as
a water tenr:,
r. The monitor of crash tender AL6 was
said to be serviceable on manual operations(cid:9)
its
electronic controls wre not functioning. The monitors
of other fire tenders were in working(cid:9)

One of
foP,
monitor which had become totally unserviceable
during! fir fighting(cid:9)
on8th March 1994 was
156

said to have been set right same day in tne evening or
the next day. The monitor mf the fire tender which was
being
used as a wafer tender had become unserviceable
about an year earlier. It took a litle over one year
to set right the said monitor.
The time _ (cid:9) .for
making unserviceable monitor depends upon the nature of
(-N
the defer* and in case .elv part is to be imported it
more time. It is not desirable that unduly long
time is taken in making a monitor serviceable even if
parts are to be imported. In such matters, bear-
ing in mind the importance of fire fighting operations,
.elearanee.7. are required to be given expeditiously.
Regarding foam formation, from the testimony of fhis
witness, it appears that the foam formation is con-
trolled by a component called Proportionafor installed
on the fire tenders and that the desired quantity is
prefixed and Proportionator does not require any ad-
justment and there cannot be any difficulty in foam
formri- timn. According to(cid:9)
esired quantity
(-N(cid:9) of foam was being produced and it is not possible to
state about the riitfi.ty of the foam by observing it by
naked eye.
The cet result is Lhat there was nothing
wanting in fire fighting operations. Rather,. the
officers and officials of all Fire Departmente. includ-
ing IAAI deserve to be complimented for their grand
efforts
to control the fire and, in particular, in
15-

saving the wings of the Aeroflot aircraft which cop-
tained 50 tonnes of fuel. Her! if not been controlled
kV and the said fuel had caught fire it would have been a
bigger disaster.

engine failure exercise should not have been
given.
2.
Capt. Khurana should have guarded / blocked
the Rudder control and given clear commands as Instruc-
tor =-1 as to obviate the application of wrong Rudder
control by th,,
trainee pilot.
3.
The crash occured due to the application of
wrong rudder by trainee pilot Vidul Mahajan during
engine failure exercise.
B.
OTHER FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS
1.
Sahara should not have planned the training
flight without retaining the records of simulator
training of the trainee pilots.
2.
Sahara knowing that Capt.Khurana was ineligi-
ble~ should not have sought approval of LISCA for
his
acting as instructor.
The nGrA should not have granted the approval
:)r.
Capt. Khurana to act as instructor since he lacked
the experience of Check Pilot for one year as stipulat-
eh by sub clause (iv) of Clause 2.2 of AIC 13/93.

ASSESSOR ASSESSOR

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
I did not know much about field of
-
FIyiTtg--when- I gave consent for performing the
functions of Court of Inquiry. In fact, let me
concede that I had no knowledge about the" techni-
cal aspects of flying or other technical aspects
of civil aviation. It would not have been possi-
ble to make this report but for the able assist-
. ance, guidance and help received from various
persons. This report would be incomplete without
my expressing gratitude to them.
Air Commodore R.P.S.Garcha, one of the
Assessors is not only a senior and experienced
Flier/Pilot but is also highly knowledgeable in
the field of flying and hard working.
(cid:9) Likewise,
the other assessor Mr.R.D.Thakur, General Manager
(Engineering) in Indian Airlines, with his deep
knowledge, devotion and hard work was able to
explain to me the technical engineering aspects
in
a simple manner so that I was able to understand
these(cid:9)
aspects without much difficulty.
(cid:9) It has
been a great pleasure to be associated with Air
Commodore Garcha and Mr.Thakur.
164

In mr.H.s.Khola, Director General of
Civil Aviation, I found deep knowledge and under-
standing of various aspects of Civil Aviation. An
efficient officer, who has been source of great
help in the investigation.
What I have stated
about Mr.Khola is equally true
about Mr.Ctinrir
Singh.(cid:9)
Mr.Satinder Singh was found to be a very
hardworking and knowledgeable officer.
(cid:9) I thank
both of them for the able assistance rendered to
me.
The Inspector of Accidents is the back-
bone of such investigations.(cid:9)
Mr.V.K.Chandna,
'Inspector of Accidents provided necessary as
sist_
.with ability. My thanks to him.
Mr.J.Szir acted as Secretary to
the
Commission.(cid:9) Rui-
for his help and assistance it
would not. have, been possible to conclude the
proceedings. It is unfortunate that he developed
some health problem soon after the conclusion of
the proceedings but inspite of that Mr.Wazir:
continued rendering the necessary assistance, for
which I am greatful to him. I also wish him good
health.
165

I am also thankful to various other
officers/officials of DGCA who have always been
ready and willing to render such help as was
required and with the smiling face.
(cid:9) In this
respect special mention may be made of Mr.K.Go-
hain, Director of Air Safety of DGCA at Bombay.
The officers o4 National Transport
Service Board, Washington, British Calidonian, UK,
Fire Department at Heathrow Airport, London, the
Fire Department at Frankfurt Airport, officers of
Lufthansa Training Centre, Frankfurt, CTE, Hydera-
bad, Air India, Indian Airlines and NAL, Bangalore
deserve to be thanked for rendering able assist-
ance, help and guidance which has been very useful
in the inquiry.
Mr.Alok Mahaian, Mr.Lalit(cid:9) Bhasin,
•
Mr.R.K.Anand, Mr.R.S.Suri, Mr.Robin Mitra and
Mr.N.A.K.Sarma, advocates who appeared in the
proceeding rendered useful assistance for which I
am thankful to them. My special thanks to
Mr.Sarma who brought out in his cross examination
of the witnee-e--,
certain important aspects with
which N.A.A. may not have been directly concerned,
but without the said aspects the report would have
been incomplete in -te real sense. I may also
record my sincere ap reciation for the services
166

rendered and work done by my personal staff.
including(cid:9) Mr.V.K.Kochhar,(cid:9) Mr.S.K.Bansal(cid:9) and
Mr.Sunil Koushal, without whose assistance the
