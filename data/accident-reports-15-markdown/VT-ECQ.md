PART-I
INTRODUCTION
This accident was unbelievable.
Boeing 737 aircraft in its take off phase hit a
lorry laden with cotten bales moving on a perpendicular
public road at a distance of 410 ft from Aurangabad 09
runway end in the hot noon of 26th Apri1,1993.
The utter disbelief of a common man can be
illustrated from the following spontaneous counter
question that the lorry owner asked the lorry driver when
the latter telephonically reported the accident to him
"Were you flying?"
55 human lives were lost in the accident. The
aircraft was totally damaged. Shri K.Gohain, Director of
Air Safety, Bombay Reyion,was immediately appointed to
act as Inspector of Accident under Rule 71 of the
Aircraft Rules, 1937 (the Rules). Vide Notification
dated 26th May,f993, issued by the Ministry of Civil
Aviation, Government of India,(Annexure-A), I was
appointed to conduct the formal investigation into the
circumstances of the accident under Rule 75 of the Rules.
Shri S.N.Gupta, Deputy Director
(Air Safety), Air India,
Bombay,(cid:9) and(cid:9) Capt.V.V.Mahesh,(cid:9) Deputy(cid:9) Director
(Operation)(Retired), Air India, were appointed to act as
assessors to assist the Court. Shri L.A.Mahalingam,
Controller of Airworthiness, Civil Aviation Department,
Bombay, was appointed to function as Secretary to the
Court.(cid:9) I was then camping at Nagpur as a Vacation
Judge. On 30th May,1993, Shri H.S.Khola, Director
General Civil Aviation, accompanied by Shri Gohain and
,Shri Mahalingam personally came to Nagpur to brief me
about the accident and the investigation carried on upto
that period. I directed the Inspector or Accident to
continue the investigation.

-2-
On 8th June,1993, Shri S.T.Deo, Regional Director
of Western Region , IA along with the other Officers of
IA, DGCA and NAA met me at Bombay, and requested to visit
the accident site. Accordingly, I along with the
Assessors, the Secretary of the Court and the Inspector
of Accident went to Aurangabad on 10th June,1993 by a
morning flight IC 492. Several other Officers also
accompanied us. I visited the cockpit prior to landing
at Aurangabad and had an aerial view of the crash site
with respect to the airfield location. Immediately, on
landing we visited the Airport, Control Tower and the
Met Office. In the afternoon, we inspected the site of
the accident. Notes and photographs were Laken. VisiL
was completed in the evening. I permitted the wreckages
(which were being guarded by the police) to be removed
from the site to their proper location to Delhi/Bombay.
There was an urgency to remove the wreckages because the
rains were expected any day. The removal of wreckages was
permitted on the undertaking that the same would be
available for inspection/test as and when required. I
also granted approval for carrying out strip examination
of the engines, wheel assemblies, elevator control
surface components etc as proposed by the Inspector of
Accident. We .found that the view of runway 09 end from
the Tower was hazy because the glass was not transparent
and this was communicated to the Tower Officer. We
returned from Aurangabad to Bombay next day by a morning
flight.
I directed the Secretary to issue a Public
NoLicc
(Annexure -B) in English as well as vernacular languages
in the leading national as well as local daily newspapers
inviting any person having knowledge or information about
the accident and who desires to make the representation
conc-erning the circumstances or causes of the accident

-3-
to do so in the form of an affidavit on or before 5th
July,1993. This Public Notice was accordingly published
on or about 17th June,1993 in several newspapers from
Bombay, Delhi, Calcutta, Madras, Aurangabad, Udaipur,
Jaipur etc.
On 13th June 1993, I held a meeting with the
Assessors and the, Inspector of Accident, and had an
informal discussion covering the follow-up action to be
taken on certain components required for further
investigation, programme of the team at DGCA Office,
Delhi, pertaining to CVR and FDR read outs and visit to
CTE,Hyderabad, for simulator exercises to be carried out
there.
On 19th June,1993, our team visited DGCA Office at
safdarjang Airport, New Delhi, where the team was
received by Shri Brijesh Kumar, Joint Secretary and CND
of IA and Shii H.S.Khola,DGCA. The representatives of
several organisations, like IA, Boeing etc., were also
present. Advocate for IA was also present to participate
in the CVR/FDR read outs. I expressed an opinion that at
that stage legal representative was not necesary,since
copy of CVR/FDR transcript will be made available to
everyone and the CVR can be replayed in open Court, if
necessary. A letter containing the staff requirement was
also handed over to the Joint secretary for speedy
action. Some other administrative problems were also
discussed with him. CVR read out was carried out several
times. After going through the CVR transcript, it was
decided that it should 'be resubmitted with refined words
and minor corrections. The transcript for the earlier
period of 17 minutes was also directed to be taken. The
DGCA officials demonstrated to the team the foil type FDR
read out along with calibration charts. We were informed

-4-
that the speed and altitude parameters were not found
recorded in the FDR foil of the illfated aircraft.
On 20th June,1993, the Learn visited the Palam
Airport to acquaint with the maintenance set up and
engine overhaul facilities for B-737 aircraft and its
JT8D-17 engine. Shri H.S.Khola and Shri S.C.Jain, CEM of
IA, accompanied the team, which was given a brief
introduction on the maintenance'programme of Boeing 737
aircraft. Demonstration on various aspects of flight
controls, cockpit indications, lights, switches, thrust
reverser etc., was given. The team was also shown around
the facilities equipped for engine 'overhau]
(cid:9) and
maintenance. The jet shop is of latest technology with
all facilities for JT8D and V2500 engines. Various engine
modules and compressors along with the test bed for
testing V2500 engine which is equipped with computerised
arrangement with close circuit television facilities were
shown and explained to the team.
On 21st June,1993, the team visited the
CTE,Hyderabad. The team was taken around the CTE by the
Director Capt.R.P.Burnwal and Engineering Manager
Operations Capt.M.V.V.Rao. Shri Khola and Flight
Inspector of DGCA Capt M.S.Sharma accompanied the team.
The Director of CTE explained the syllabus for initial
and recurrent training for B-737 Pilot and Co
-pilot. He
also explained LOFT for the pilots. The flying records
of P1 and P2 handed over to the Secretary. The Instructor
Shri B.S.Sidhu explained the various RTOW calculations
for Aurangabad Airport in addition to interpretation of
various charts covering weight, wind, air speed etc., and
compilation of load and trim sheet on B-737 aircraft. A
trial compilation of load and trim sheet on B-737
aircraft using a load and trim computer was also
demonstrated.

-5-
The team visited B-737 training simulator. It is a
six axis training simulator of ridiffusion simulation
fitted with JT8D-17 engines. Various flight exercises
were carried out on the simulator, such as, normal
rotation, slow rotation, under rotation, late rotation.
These exercises were for various RTOW and different
outside temperatures. The simulator was flown by Capt.
Henry D'Costa for more than three hours. Prints of the
various flights profile were also obtained.
On 22nd June,1993, the team was briefed about Cabin
Crew training including initial and recurrent training
syllabus. The various operation circulars-mandatory,
recommendatory and informative(cid:9) were shown. The
operation of the elevator and horizontal stablizer along
with structural attachment with the help of slides were
also explained. The video film showing rotation
technique and significant importance of Vl,VR and V2
speed was also shown. We returned to Bombay on that day
in the evening.
On receiving message that fresh read outs were
ready, the team visited DGCA Office at New Delhi on 10th
& 11th July,1993. The copies of full transcript of CVR
were supplied. The detailed FDR data was not completed
by that time and hence only limited comparison with
reference to CVR read out like heading, vertical
acceleration etc. was possible. The full CVR was
replayed covering the entire tape. Various groups for
conducting different analysis were formed. I informed the
Inspector of Accident to include as far as possible all
associated group reports in his main report and submit
.the same before the pre-hearing conference fixed in the
Court room on 20th July,1993.
On 12th July 1993, the team visited the maintenance

-6-
facilities of IA at Calcutta where the accidental
aircraft had last check C-2 inspection. The team was
accompanied by Shri Khola and(cid:9) Capt.J.R.D.Rao, RD of IA.
The CEM of Calcutta explained to us the general
maintenance activities of Calcutta base. We visited the
hanger and also the instrument shop where FDR overhaul
facilities and the, calibration of B-737 FDR in the FDR
Test Rig were explained.
On 19th July 1993, as suggested by the Assessors, I
visited Air India facilities at Bombay. In the visit of
JT8D Engine Overhaul Shop I inspected the stripped
components from the PORT and STABD Engine of the
illfated aircraft. Various components conditions and
salient features of the strip Investigation report were
explained to me. I also visited Air India Air Bus A-310
simulator where various flying profiles were
demonstrated.
The first pre-hearing conference of the Court of
Inquiry was held in Court Room No.46,I1 floor, High Court
building at Bombay at 11.00 AM on 20th July 1993 as
notified. I had earlier issued individual notices to as
many as 11 parties who had expressed desire to
participate in the inquiry. After hearing parties, I
granted request of the following parties for giving them
particpant status :-
1) IA;
2) P1;
3) P2;
4) ICPA, Bombay;
5) Common Man's Forum,Bombay;
6) P & W;
7) Boeing Company,Seattle USA;
8) DGCA,Delhi.

-7-
None for NAA was present. Since its participation in
the Inquiry was essential,I ordered it tribe added as
party. None for AIAEA & ARO & FOOA were present though
they had requested for participant status.
:41 that day the Inspector of Accident submitted a
report dated 18th July 1993 in two parts. Its copies
were ordered to be'supplied to all the parties. Parties
were directed to file their detailed statements along
with (a) the affidavits; (b)the documents on which they
want to rely; and (c) the list and the detailed
addresses of the witnesses they want to examine.
(cid:9) It
was decided by consent that the evidence of the
witnesses in the first instance shall be given by
filing the affidavits which will be considered as the
examination-in-chief. i directed the parties to
exchange copies on or before 17th August,1993 and as
suggested by all fixed the 2nd pre-hearing
conference
on 24th August,1993. Similarly, by consent of parties,
27th August,1993 was fixed as the date for commencing
open public inquiry.
After the proceedings were over and parties
dispersed,Shri K. V.Vishwanath, Member of the Committee
of AIAEA and Shri Satyanarayan Pande, Jt.Secretary of
ARO & FOOA approached me in the chamber renewing their
request for grant of participant status. I called upon
them to remain present in the Court on 24th
August,1993.
Vide communication dated 13th July 1993, the
CTE,Hyderabad, categorically informed the Inspector of
Accident that the quantitative data and analysis cannot
be given by the simulation exercises carried out there
on 21st June,1993 as the simulator was only for the use

-8-
of pilot training and was equipped with JT8D-17 engines
which are at variance with the engines fitted for the
(cid:9)
accidental aircraft.
As noticed earlier, altitude
and speed traces were not available on FDR foil and
hence aircraft profile during take off with values of
speed,height etc could not be estimated. The aircraft
had prima facie failed to attain the prescribed height
at the appropriate distance after lift off. For these
reasons the Assessors as well as Inspector of Accident
opined that simulation of the aircraft performance with
various deviation of loads, rotation techniques in an
engineering based performance computer or any
other simulator having capacity to give output in an
exact quantitative manner, was quite(cid:9)
essential.(cid:9)
On
inquiry it was learnt that the Boeing Co. Seattle (USA)
being the designer and the manufacturer of the type
aircraft has the engineering simulator fitted with
engine type on the accidental aircraft (JT8D-9A).
Government of India and DGCA requested the Boeing Co.
to assist the Court of Inquiry by providing the
simulation exercises on simulator with a view to
understand the scenario of the subject accident.
Boeing Co. through its director Air Safety
Investigation and Flight Test Mr John W.Purvis showed
willingness and drew up a programme from 3rd August to
5th August,1993. Diplomatic passport for me could not
be prepared in time.
Since(cid:9) I(cid:9) showed teluctdnce
to travel without it, the programme was postponed by a
week. The Court along with the Inspector of Accident
went to Seattle where simulation exercises interspread
with discussions were carried out on 10th,11th and 12th
August,1993. Boeing Safety Investigation was
represented by Mr.J.Dennis Rodrigues. Other experts
who associated with the exercises and discussions were
Mr.James W.Kerrigan, Principal Engineer Stability and
Control and Aerodynamics and Mr Peteris A.Galins Lead

-9-
Engineer Performance Group. Capt.John H.Armstrong,
Chief Pilot Air Safety flew the simulator. Evidence
available from the CVR tape transcript, statements;
recorded by the Inspector, data regarding the
Aerodrome, the road on which the truck was operating
and various weather conditions and various loads on the
aircraft were discussed. Exercises were carried out on
various combinations of loads, aircraft speeds,
environmental conditions, pilot actions/reactions,
rotation techniques etc.
Study of "human factor" in the accident was
involved. It was earlier suggested by the Inspector of
Accident and the Assessors that as was done before,
expert advice on the subject from the AMES Research
Centre NASA,Moffett Field,Sanfrancisco (USA) should be
taken. Government of India contacted the AMES Centre
through USA Government. The AMES Centre had agreed to
tender the required advice and accordingly visit to the
Centre was also fixed along with visit to SeaLL1e.
With the help of the Assessors, certain broad questions
were formulated. Visit to the centre was finalized on
13th,16th and 17th August,1993 - 14th and 15th August
being weekends - in consultation with Dr.Irving
Statler,the Chief of Aero Space Human Factors Research
Division. Accordingly we visited the Centre where we
were received by Dr.Key Dismukes, the Chief Scientist.
We had useful conferences with Dr.Statler, Dr.Dismukes
and other experts like Dr. Barbara G.Kanki, Research
Psychologist(cid:9) (Crew (cid:9) Factors(cid:9) Group),(cid:9) MLLinda
Connell,research Psychologist. Team returned to India
on 20th August,1993.
Second pre-hearing conference was held as
scheduled on 24th August,1993 when the NAA appeared.
Shri Satyanarayan Pandey,Jt.secretary of ARO&FOOA also

-10-
was present. The Inspector of Accident filed a
supplimentary report dated 23rd August,1993 on
simulation exercises, carried out at Seattle. Its
copies were given to the parties. All parties were
permitted to inspect the documents in the office.
Parties expressed a desire for playing CVR tapes in the
open Court on the next day. At the request of the
parties, time to'file rebuttal statements Was extended
upto 30th August,1993. In this conference the
MIA,Aurangabad appeared and requested for particpant
status. The said request was granted.
On 25th August,PP)3 the CVR tape;; we/ z, pl,P

the open Court. After considering all suggestions, the
points for determination in the inquiry were
formulated.
On 30th August,1993,the third sitting of the Court was
held. Parties requested for extension of time to file
rebuttal statements and affidavits upto 6th
September,1993. The said request was granted. The
tentative list of witnesses tci be examined, the order
of their examination and the cross-examination
were
finalized. At the common suggestion of all the parties,
13th September,1993 was fixed for recording of
evidence. A tentative weekly calendar of the witneses
was prepared in advance.
Recording of oral evidence commenced on 13th
September,1993 and was completed on 8th November,1993
in four sessions, with gaps in between as desired by
the parties. First Session was held from 13th
September to 24th September,Second Session from

ARO & FOOA was neither represented by any one
nor it participated in the Inquiry.
Under Rule 75(2) of the Rules which are framed
by the Central Government in exercise of powers
conferred by Section 5 and 8(2) of the Aircraft Act
1934, such formal investigation/inquiry is to be held
in open Court in such manner and under such conditions
as the Court may think most effectual for ascertaining
the causes and circumstances of the accident. Though
the Court has been endowed by Rule 75(3) of the Rules
with all powers of the Civil Court under the C.P.Code,
neither that Code nor Evidence Act strictly apply to
the Inquiry. Court can thus obtain the required
information and collect evidence from all sources and
through all possible channels without being fettered by

-13--
the rules of procedure and evidence. Part IV Chapter 4
of ICAO Manual of Aircraft Accident Investigation gives
guidance for evaluating the evidence. The basic
approach to be adopted is that of a domestic tribunal
exercising quasi judicial functions. The main care to
be taken is to see that the basic principles of nautral
justice are not violated and a person or party against
whom any information or material is used, is yiven fair
chance to explain it. As per Rule 75(6) of the Rules,
the Court is to report to the Central Government not
only its findings as to the causes and circumstances of
the Accident, but also to make observations and
recommendations for the cancellation, suspension or
endorsement of any licence or certificate issued under
the Rules.
All the above approches,objects, factors and
principles have been kept in view in this Inquiry.

PART-II
A. FACTUAL INFORMATION
A.1 HISTORY OF THE FLIGHT :
At about 1306 IST on Monday, the 26th
Apri1,1993,IA scheduled flight (IC-491) crashed no
sooner it took off from Aurangabad Airport. It was
Boeing 737, aircraft VT-ECQ. This hopping flight
originated at Palam Airport, New Delhi with last_
destination Santacruz Airport, Bombay. Intermediate
stops were Jaipur, Udaipur, and Aurangabad.
Commander of the flight was Capt.S.N.Singh. The
First Officer was capt.Manisha Mohan. Total number of
cabin crew was four - two Airhostesses and two flight
pursers. Considering the total number of flight hours,
no change of crew was involved. IC 491 departed Palam
on schedule and landed at Aurangabad Airport at 1230
abobt 30 minutes late. While landing at Auranyabad it
carried 79 passengers, out of which 18 passengers were
bound for Aurangabad. Aircraft was refuelled,baggages,
freight were loaded and 51 passengers boarded at
Aurangabad, thus raising the total number of passengers
to 112 at the time of take off from Auranyabad.
ATC Aurangabad suggested runway 27 for take off.
But at the instance of the Commander, ATC gave
clearance for using runway 09. The aircraft taxied
from apron, upon entering(cid:9) the runway turned right
backtracked towards the beginning of the runway and
commenced a rolling take off after turning at the
dumbell.

-15-
Aircraft lifted up almost at the end of 6000 ft
runway and impacted heavily with a lorry carrying
pressed cotton bales runing from North to South on a
high way kno wn as Beed Road located perpendicularly
outside the Airport boundary wall at a distance of 410
ft from the end of runway. The aircraft left main
landing gear, left engine bottom cowling and thrust
reverser,the APU.shroud drain mast impacted the left
side of the truck at the height of nearly seven feet
from the level of the road. After the impact, the
aircraft •continued on its flight path, with the left
landing gear liberated, followed by liberation of the
left engine thrust reverser, portion of the left
horizontal'stabiliser leading edge and portion of the
left elevator surface. The liberated parts were strewn
on open area to the East of the road. The cotton bales
were opened by the impact and loose cotton was(cid:9) spread
on and around the road.
The aircraft continued the flight in the left
turn and went through the high tension electric wires
running East-West at about 35 ft above the ground level
at a distance of nearly 3 kms North-East of the runway.
It mushed into the ground. From the first point of
impact in the open field, the grounds marks were
towards North-East. The final rest position was(cid:9) about
1/2 kms from the wires. The aircraft fuselage had split
and separated into two pieces at aft of the wing
trailing edge location.(cid:9) The cabin sections in both
portions caught fire. 53 pasengers, 2 members of the
cabin crew were fatally injured. 11 passengers
received serious injuries. The Commander, the First
Officer and two cabin crew members who were in the
first section of the cabin,and 59 passengers were the
lucky survivors.

-16-
The senior fire foreman in the watch tower saw
the aircraft getting airborne near the runway end and
impacting the moving truck on the road with its
undercariage. On noticing the falling landing gears
and the left direction of the aircraft, the senior fire
foreman apprehended danger and without loss of time
ordered turn out, in the Fire Station. One CFT and one
jeep which had started initially, saw smoke coming out
from the field on the left and hence they proceeded in
that direction through the rough fields. The duty ATC
tower officer saw the aircraft after getting airborne
gaining some height turning left and then losing
height.(cid:9) He switched on the siren. He received the
"May-day" call from the aircraft by that time. He saw
smoke and alerted airport firemen transmitting crash in
North-East direction at about 7 kms. He also received
a R/T call "It has crashed".
One ambulance coming to Aurangabad from Nanded
had also;Proceeded towards the scene. The occupants of
the ambulance first noticed the smoke and then the
split portion of the crashed aircraft on the field.
They also saw dead passengers lying in the open area
between the two portions. Some of the passengers had
already come out of the wreckage from the left front
cabin entry door and some by jumping out from the
breakway fuselage portion. The right side of the
emergency window could not be opened. One passenger at
the rear could come out from the rear left door after
opening and jumping through it. The cabin crew at the
rear received fatal injuries due to fire. The flight
crew came out of the aircraft through the cockpit
sliding window.
Survivors assembled under a tree. Some of
injured were taken in an ambulance to the hospital.

-17-
Upon receiving information from the ATC Tower,
the City Police moved its men and machinery towards the
site. IA staff at the airport mobilised the available
IA bus and the staff and moved towards the direction of
the site. The NAA officials from the airport equipped
with walkie-talkie for maintaining two way
communication with tower, also proceeded to the site.
By the time, the ambulance started shifting the injured
passengers towards the main road, other vehicles
arrived. The safety vehicles got engaged to douse the
fire. The other vehicles were utilised for removing
the injured to hospital. The Municipal Corporation,
fire fighting services, fire fighting vehicles also
arrived and supplemented the fire fighting and rescue
efforts. The safety personnel went into the wreckage
after dousing the fire flames.
The accident occurred in the forenoon when the
sun was brightest on that hot day. The main wreckage
was strewn in plot no.361 having geographical location
as :Latitude 19° 52' 30" and Longitude 75° 26' 19";
average elevation of 1900 ft AMSL and at an aerial
distance of 3.1/2 kms from the end of runway 09.

PIC experience on B 737 is 140.35 hr:;.
Commander obtained the B-737 type endorsement
on his licence on 17th April,1986,and was found fit
to fly B-737 aircraft as Co-polot. He had earlier
undergone B-737 Technical Conversion Course, B-737
simulator training by day and night at the
CTE,Hyderabad, followed by flying checks on the
aeroplane by day and night. In these checks, his
proficiency was adjudged as Standard by the
Instructor Pilot and Examiner.
He commenced command training on B-737 on
11th June,1989. this training was,• however,
discontinued on 16th June,1989, at his own request.
During the above training, the Instructor pilot at
the end of the 4th Session on the CTE's Simulator
had recorded some adverse observations on his
proficiency on 16th June,1989.
When appeared for his ALTP licence renewal
medical examination at Institute of Aviation
Medicine, Bangalore, on 13th September,1989, he was
declared temporarily medically unfit for two weeks
due to ECG abnormality, TMT & Echocardioyraph.
Thereafter, on 16th October,1989, he was
investigated upon by the Classified Specialist on
Aviation Medicine and Cardiologist who considered
him to have no cardio-vascular disability and was
certified fit both medically and surgically. His
ALTP licence had a limitation from September,l978
which requires him to use corrective lenses while
exercising the privileges of his licence.

-20-
Subsequently, on 10th November,1989, he
satisfactorily completed the B-737 Technical Refresher
& IR/LR Simulator training and check at CTE,Hyderabad
and was found fit. He was found fit for PIC training
on 27th February,1990 by the check pilot who had
overall assessed him as standard. He was again taken
up for B-737 PIC training by the IA on 2nd April,1991,
and he completed satisfactorily the training and check
on Simulator and flying checks by day on the aircraft
at CTE,Hyderabad. He also completed the flying checks
by night on the aircraft on 17th july,1991 with a
different DGCA-
approved examiner who also assessed him
as standard. He was thereafter taken up for LOFT,
wherein after completion of 14 flights he was put
through additional LOFTS to reach .the required
standard. On 23rd October,1991, he failed to pass the
B-737 performance refresher test and was, therefore,
stopped for being rostered for route flying. He was
made to undergo the B-737 performance course on 9th'
December,1991. In his PIC Route Check (day and night),
reports of 1st December,1991 and 2nd December 1991
respectively, the check pilots certified him to be
"FIT to fly as Pl-Std." However, on the subsequent
PIC Route Check (day) report of 4th December,1991,
another check-pilot assessed his inflight performance
as below standard with knowledge of performance,
planning, crew briefing as poor. CTE,Hyderbad
recommenced his 10 PIC route checks and Dir. of
Operations IA advised CTE,Hyderabad, to arrange the
9th and 10th PIC route checks with Examiners Capts.
H.F.Mistry and L.Lingam. However, since Capt.Mistry
was not available, the said route check was required
to be done either by Capt R.C.Moulay or
Capt.R.L.Kapur. In all the 10 routes check reports

-21-
including those of Capt.Lingam and Capt.Moulay, the
assessment of Capt.S.N.Singh has been made as standard
and fit to fly as PIC. Capt Singh was granted B-737
type PIC endorsement by DGCA Office on the 16th
January,1992. Thereafter, he was again sent to
Hyderabad CTE for undergoing B-737 Technical
Refresher/LR check prior to renewal of his licence.
He completed LR ,check on B-737 simulator and B-737
technical refresher in July,1992 satisfactorily.
Thereafter,he was route checked as a Commander by
Check pilot Capt I.David on 9th October,1992 and was
cleared to fly as Pilot in Command on B-737 aircraft.
His last simulator IR/LR refresher as P1 on B-737
aircraft was carried out at CTE on 29th October,1992
by Capt.R.P.Burnwal who had assessed him "Fit".
He was not earlier involved in any aircraft
accident. Preceding the date of accident, he had
flown for 07:40 Hrs in the last 7 days period and
57.00 hrs. in the last one month period.

_27_
The ATC tape transcript reveals that while giving
take off clearance to the aircraft, the ATC passed the
winds as 180/05 kts, and that start up was given about 6
min.45 sec prior to the aircraft reported "Rolling". Its
actual departure as recorded by Tower. was 0735 UTc.
Therefore at the start up the 0700 UTC Metar was
available at Tower for transmission to aircraft on
ground.
The Hygrograph Chart No.53/59 was set at 0846 hrs
on the date of accident by the Meteorological Deptt. at
Aurangabad and removed at 2002 hrs. The said chart
reveals that prior to the accident the humidity was 30%
at 1200 hrs as well as 1230 hrs. The value decreased to
29% at 1300 hrs and was on decreasing trend
till
1800 hrs to 26%. Between 1200 hrs and 1800 hrd there was
no abrupt and significant change in the humidity values.
The rainfall chart No.919/70 set at 0848 hrs on the date
of accident and removed at 2003 hrs on that date
indicates nil mm of rainfall. Also the temperature
chart no.135/6
0 set at 0846 hrs and removed at 2002 hrs
on the date of accident reveals temperature of 38'C at
1200 hrs and 1230 hrs, 38.5"C at 1300 hrs and at 1330
hrs. The highest temperature recorded is 40.3-C at 1410
hrs on that date. This chart reveals that there had been
a gradual increase in the temperature from the time the

(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)
-28-
significant changes in the atmospheric pressure values
over the airfield at the time of accident. The trend is
gradual decrease to 940.5 HPa at 1705 hrs.
The DIWE record which gives values of wind
direction and speed in a graphical manner reveals that
from 1200 hrs till 1330 hrs the winds were variable both
in speed and direction and the winds prevalent were
shifting from the North-Easterly to South-Easterly
direction. At around 1300 hrs the winds as traced on the
graph were about 140/06 kts(cid:9)
giving a headwind
component for runway 09.
A.8(cid:9) AIDS TO NAVIGATION :
The accidental flight was conducted under visual
references. No navigational aids were involved. However,
there were no reported difficulties with the aids.
A.9(cid:9) COMMUNICATION:

A.10(cid:9) AERODROME INFORMATION:
Aurangabad Airport has only one runway at
orientation 09/27 (exact 087(1267').
Its length is 6000
ft x 150 ft. It has coordinates 19°51'49" N & 75°23'55"
N. The runway strength is 40 LCN and has an elevation of
1907 ft amsl. The TORA and ASDA for runway 09 is 6000 ft
and TODA IS 6360 ft. The elevation of the runway at 09
beginnning is 581.61 meters (1908 ft) and has a downward
slope towards runway 27 beginning which is 573.5m (1880
ft). The average slope percentage is-0.4.

-29-
There is brick boundary wall of average 3 ft
height on the East adjacent to which is North-South
public road known as Beed road. From 1975 to 1985/86
gates in the form of barriers were provided on that road
inline with the extremities of the airport. These gates
were closed during aircraft movements. These gates were
however not in existence since 1986 and upto the date of
accident. Subsequent to the accident, NAA in
association with the local police and administration got
the barriers reerected, with police on duty for
regulating the traffic and aerodrome watch and ward
1
staff tocoordinate between the Tower and the traffic
police at the time of aircraft movement.
At Aurangabad, which is a domestic airport, there
were no Fixed Distance Markers installed on the date of
accident. However, subsequent to the accident they were
„nstallga,joy, NAA at every 1000 ft interval.
A.11(cid:9) FLIGHT RECORDERS :
B-737 aircraft VT-ECQ was fitted with a Fairchild
CVR Model A100 (S/N 6316) and Fairchild FDR Model No.109D
(S/N 577). Both the above units were retrieved from the
wreckage and taken to the DGCA laboratory at Delhi for
preparing read outs.
A.11.1 Cockpit Voice Recorder :
The CVR unit was examined by a Group constituted
by DGCA for preparing the transcript. The CVR unit was
structurally intact and was exposed to post impact fire.
Test switches were burnt extensively. Upon stripping of

-30-
the unit, it was found that the stainless steel body had
smoke signatures. The electronic cards were extensively
burnt including the cable harness. The internal
recording mechanism including the tape and reel assembly
were in sound condition. Full transcript of CVR is given
as Annexure-F.
A.11.2 Flight Data Recorder :
The FDR which is of a foil type has the flight
data embossed on the foil by means of scribers. The unit
was examined at DGCA laboratory (Technical Centre), on
27th April, 1993 and it was found structurally integral
and exposed to extensive fire. The backcover with plug
assembly was missing and the electronic assembly unit
containing power supply and cards were extensively
damaged. After the working mechanism was taken out it
was observed that the cassette assembly containing the
foil was exposed to heat and the portion of the foil
exposed outside the cassette window had a powdery deposit
due to exposure of the foil to heat . It was also
observed that the air speed stylus and the altitude
stylus had disengaged from the capsule mechanism and were
freely moving up and down. Under normal conditions the
altitude stylus remains in the lower portion and the air
speed stylus
remains in the upper side of the foil in
contact with the foil surface. The heading and vertical
acceleration marks were available on the foil surface.
The salient observations as given by the Group
constituted by DGCA from the FDR foil are as follows:
i) The Air Speed and Altitude tracing were missing
from beginning of the foil.
ii) Both the Air Speed and Altitude stylus
had
disengaged after last foil change as such no
tracing was available on these two parameters for
previous flights also.

-31-
iii) The heading, verticalacceleration, and time
traces were available on the foil.
iv) The aircraft after entering the runway proceeded
west heading,i.e.towards runway 27 end and after
turning from the left side aligned ox _heading for
take off from 09 runway.
v) The estimated aircraft lift off is from the 'G'
trace at about 7 seconds prior to the first
impact experienced by the aircraft.
vi) From the aircraft transmission of "...Rolling..."
to the transmission "Rotate" is 35 seconds and
the lift off is estimated at 4 seconds after
"Rotate" transmission.
A corelation chart of the FDR trace and the CVR
recordings pertaining to the accident portion of the
flight is Annexure-G.
A.12(cid:9) WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INVESTIGATION :
A.12.1 General :
The aircraft soon after lift off hit the truck
loaded with cotton bales moving on the Beed road just
outside the airport boundary wall. The truck was moving
from South to North on the road,i.e.from right to left in
relation to the path of the taking off aircraft. The
centre line of the Beed road is 410 ft ahead of the
runway 09 end.
On impact with truck, the marks of the aircraft
left main wheels got imprinted on the left side wall of
the truck at a height of 7 ft from the road level. The
outboard
tyre mark was 6'4" aft of the truck cabin. The

-32-
total height of the truck super structure was 11 ft from
the road level and the cotton bales were laden upto
nearly the same height. The two vertical angle iron
members supporting the side wall were folded inward,i.e.
in the direction of the aircraft flight path. The right
side of the truck body wall upto the rear most location
was found bent outwards by about 60". Cotton from the
bales was found strewn on the other side of the road
heavily spread over an area of 80' x 120' with six
cotton bales remaining intact. The truck in its final
stop position had moved ahead on the road from the strewn
cotton location.
The aircraft left engine rear bottom just foward
of the thrust reverser cowl and the APU shrotid drain mast
on the left side of the fuselage aft of the trailing edge
flaps contacted the truck body wooden super structure and
iron members at the top. The left engine thrust reverser
with its fittings including the cowl and the APU shroud
drain mast got liberated. A piece of "U" shape iron
fitting of the truck body for affixing the top horizontal
wooden beam of the truck was retrieved entangled with the
thrust reverser cowl. The drain mast shroud had evidence
of sharp and stright contact damage on its outward face
in the fore and aft direction. The left engine thrust
reverser deflector doors did not have evidence of impact
damage on their outer surfaces. The thrust reverser tail
pipe section had a sharp bent inwards in the longitudinal
axis at its bottom. The APU shroud drain mast was
retrieved close to the boundary wall on the road side. A
portion of the thrust reverser of the left engine was at
630 ft from the runway end towards the right of the
denterline and the thrust reverser lock actuator
mechanism was at 1080' from the runway end to the left of
the centreline. The thrust reverser cowling was located

-33-
at 810' from the runway end on the left of the centerline
and to the left of the main wheel position. The thrust
reverser tail pipe flange was at 850' from the end on
extended runway centreline and the thrust
reverser-
fairing was at 815' from the runway end adjacent to the
tail pipe flange location.
The left main gear after impact of the wheels
with the truck body side wall get liberated at its hinged
trunion on the wing spar together with its actuator and
the walking beam. The landing gear portion retaining the
wheels and the inner tube of the shock strut bounced on
the ground and snatched barbed wires from fencing across
the road and these wires entangled with the wheel bogie.
Both the main wheel tyres were found deflated with
extensive damage. This part is located
810' from the
runway end in the fields across the road to
the left of
the extended centreline. The port landing gear actuator
assembly was found at 1070' from the runway end to the
left of the extended centerline.
The liberation in flight of
heavy mass from the
port landing gear and the port engine thrust reverser
assembly with the aircraft nose up attitude resulted in
these heavy liberated masses contacting the port side
horizontal
stablizer and the elevator hinged to the
stabilizer at its rear end. The outer portion of the
horizontal stabilizer from the port side of the aircraft,
measuring 98" spanwise was located at 600' from the
runway end
on the right side of the extended centerline
and the outer portion of the port side elevator measuring
115" spanwise was located at 875' from the runway end on
the left of the
extended certerline. The leading edge of
the horizontal stabilizer measuring 55" length from the
torn edge was severely crumbled and jagged with black

-34-
deposits on it. The upper and lower skin exhibited clean
tear in the fore and aft direction. The above damage on
the tail side, indicate chordwise tear of the horizontal
stabilizer continuing upto the port elevator as a result
of impact with heavy mass at the leading edge of
horizontal stablizer.
The above liberated parts were localised within
an area of 500' x 260' in the field East of Beed road in
line with direction of flight.
After losing the above parts, the aircraft still
remaining in flight impacted a set of three overhead
electrical wires at a height of 21' from. the ground at
about 31/2 Kms. North East of runway end depicted on plot
361 of Aurangabad. These wires belong to the
MSEB,Aurangabad-Jalna feeder line and usually carry 33 KV
power. Luckily at that time the power supply in the
above
high tension wires was not there due maintenance.(cid:9)
The
aircraft snapped all the three wires almost at its
middle location between the two support poles 400' apart.
At 100'ahead of the wires the left engine bottom
initially contacted the ground leaving longitudinal drag
mark for 59' after which at a further distance of 90' the
left engine again contacted the ground for a further
distance of 60'. At 44' after the left engine had
contacted the ground for the second time the aircraft
right main wheels touched the ground and the scarmarks of
the wheels moving on the ground was evident for
70'. At
this distance the aircraft stillmoving forward collided
with 2 trees standing across the path. Both the
trees
were severed at their ground level and the branches were
thrown forward to a distance of 59' and 69'. After the

-35-
above impact with trees, aircraft left side flap parts
and left engine cowl pieces started dropping cn the
ground. The left engine forward mount was retrieved 95'
from the impact with the trees and the engine rear mount
was retrieved at a further distance of 180' from the
trees. The left engine devoid of its mounts finally
rested at 350' from the impact point with the trees
leaving ground scars. After losing the left engine on
the trail a deep impression mark for 37' was evident on
the ground which is made by the nose landing gear as the
nose landing gear lock actuator was found at 15' forward
from the end of this ground mark. Thereafter at 110'
forward of the nose wheel contact mark the right engine
oil tank and engine cross shaft were found on, the trail.
Other engine components line hydraulic pump, nose cowl,
fan discharge casing, engine fire seal system were
progressively dropped out as the aircraft continued
moving forward oNNr the ground. The right main landing
gear bay portions were found dropped at 745' from the
im-pact with the two trees. The right main landing gear
severed from the shock absorber inner tube was lying at
the rear of the forward fuselage portion. The outboard
main wheel assembly of the right side landing gear got
detached from its axle and was located far from the
wreckage in unburnt condition. The tyre was holding
pressure. The nose landing gear with its shock absorber
was separated from the fuselage and was lying unburnt at
left of the main wreckage.
At 1160' from the overhead MSEB wires the
aircraft still moving forward on ground on its fuselage
belly, impacted a Babool tree of 18" diameter fully
uprooting the tree from its roots. Pieces of the right

-36-
side wing spar were found embedded in the bottom portion
of the tree trunk with a part of the spar twisted in a
"S" shape.
On impact with the Babool tree, the aircraft
fuselage split open in the vertical plane, into two
separate portions at aft of the wing trailing
edge,i.e.just aft of the 19th cabin window from the
front. The rear portion of the split fuselage
sectionretained the structure from the aft cargo door
rearwards and the remainder section of the fuselage was
with the forward portion of the split fuselage. The
forward portion of the fuselage with portions of the main
wings attached to the fuselage on both the sides, at the
wing root ends, moved forward for 190' before coming to
final stop. The rear portion of the split fuselage was
lying upside down and tilted to the right side resting on
the right horizontal stablizer and elevator and the
vertical fin/rudder and the split portion of the fuselage
was lying 106' from the Babool tree and to the right of
the trail.
A.12.2 Fuselage:
The aircraft fuselage containing the cockpit,
cabin and the cargo hold sections was in one piece till
impact with the Babool tree at a distance of 1160' from
the MSEB high tension wires. After impact with the
Babool tree with the right side of the nose section and
the right wing spar, the fuselage split into two sections
aft of the wing trailing edge.
The front portion with the cockpit moved forward
for 190' and its final stop position was facing a

-37-
magnetic heading of 045°. The cockpit interior section
was intact with no signs of any fire damage. However,
there is evidence of black soot deposits on the overhead
cockpit panels and the roof adjacent to the cockpit door.
The cockpit entry door was jammed in the closed
position. The right side of the fuselage nose section
aft of the radome was torn circumferentially with tree
branches embedded in it. The left side emergency escape
rope in the cockpit was found deployed and the right side
rope was in stowed position. Both the cockpit side
windows were found in open position. The cockpit seats
were on their locations without any damage. In the cabin
section of the fuselage front split portion, the left
main forward entry door was in full open, position. The
right main front entry door was in an unlocked condition
with the door handle in the open mode, but the door was
jammed inwards in its cutout near the closed position.
The cabin section had extensive fire damage and the roof
of the cabin aft of the cockpit upto the top level of the
cabin windows was totally consumed by fire. On the right
side • the fuselage skin upto the 12th window from the
front was available and on the left side the skin upto
the 7th window from the front was available. The cabin
interior was totally burnt including the seats and the
floor board above the front cargo hold had caved in with
fire damage. The floor board rear of the cargo hold and
over the main wheel bay was consumed by fire. The front
cargo hold was partially consumed by fire with baggages
therein also damaged by fire. The fire damage in this
portion of the fuselage indicates spread of fire from the
rear of the split portion towards the front.
The rear portion of the split fuselage which was
in an inverted position had severe fire damage right upto

L
L
-38-
the rear galley and rear toilet. The right rear cabin
door was in closed position and the left rear cabin door
including the adjacent fuselage section was consumed by
fire. The interior of the rear cabin including the seats
and floor board and roof was consumed by fire. The rear
1
cargo hold interior was consumed by fire. The rear
fuselage belly skin which was towards the top after the
rear portion got inverted, was available on the wreckage.
The tail section bottom of the fuselage including the
housing of the Auxilliary Power Unit did not have any
longitudinal grazing marks and/or impact signatures on
the skin. The available skin on the rear portion of the
split fuselage had evidence of circumferential rub marks
with wrinkles indicating that after having split the rear
portion of the fuselage had rolled over to its inverted
position. A set of three passenger chairs in totally
burnt condition was found entangled on the branches of
the Babool tree which had fallen on the ground due impact.
The available outside surfaces of the split
portions of the fuselage do not have any evidence of the
blackening due fire streaking rearwards as a result of
forward motion of the aircraft.
A.12.3 Wings :
Both the wings at the final wreckage were found
attached at their root ends with the fuselage. The
outboard portion of the right wing measuring 30' from its
tip and the outboard portion of the left wing measuring
16.5' from the tip were lying upside down on their
respective sides away from the main wings. The leading
edges of both the wings had signs of impact damage. The
wings top sections had no carbon soot deposits. However

-39-
the fire damages were evident inside the fuel chambers of
the wings. Portions of the right wing front spar were
found embedded in the trunk of the Babool tree.
A.12.4 Engines :
The right engine (S.no.P 674483) was totally
stripped of its cowlings and was located close to the
main wreckage with its bottom components and accessories
left behind on the wreckage trail prior to the aircraft
impacting the Babool tree. The left engine
(S. no. P-687725) lying 650' prior to the main wreckage
location, had its nose cowl attached severely damaged
with the cowl bottom portion pushed inwards into the
engine towards the attached nose spinner..The engine as a
whole was bowed downwards stretching open at its HPC
flange joint around 12 0' Clock position with crumbling
of the bottom section.
Both the engines were transported to Air India
Engine shop at Bombay for strip examination. The P & W
representative was also asscoiated in the said ex
amination. From the strip Investigation Report it is
revealed that :
1. Both the engines had received heavy secondary
damage caused by impact of the left engine
initially with the truck and subsequently with
the ground. The right engine. had damaged due to
impact with the ground.
2. There was no basic failure of any part of the
engine or any significant gas path deterioration
in either engine prior to impact, which could
have prevented either from being capable of
developing full rated thrust during the take off.

L -40-
3.
There is no indication on either engine of any
internal/external fire and there is no
penetration of the engine casings of either
engine due to release of any uncontained
particles as a result of internal failure of the
engines.
4.
The Pt2, sense line in the nose dome of both
engines were free from blockage and the available
Pt2/Pt7 lines of the left engine and the Pt7
probe of the right engine were also found free
from blockage. The above indicates uninterrupted
signal to the cockpit indicators on engine
pressure ratio (EPR) used for determining power
generation.
5.
The left engine was rotating at low RPM when
impacted with the ground and the right engine was
rotating at very high speed when impacted with
the ground. The lower RPM of the left engine was
as a result of the
separation of its thrust
reverser follow up cable when the said engine
thrust reverser impacted the truck and got
liberated in flight.
A.12.5 Flight Controls :
The aircraft had performed the take off with its
trailing edge flaps set at Flap 5 position. Even though
at the wreckage, the flap lever in the cockpit was found
at position 1 and free to move to any selection, the
measurements of the travel of the flap screw jacks viz.
No.1 & No.8,i.e.both sides outboard flap screw j
(cid:9)acks ,
No.4 and No.5 screw jacks, revealed that the flaps at the
time of accident flight were set to position 5. Also the
two leading edge slat actuators, were found extended

-41-
without any evidence of heating due fire. The slat
actuator pistons were found bent and deformed in their
extended position indicating that the slats were also
extended at the time of accident flight.
The cockpit selection of the THS was found at 5
units Up(Green Band). The dimensional check at the
wreckage of the stabliser screw ball nut position with
respect to the acutator assembly was found at 18" and
also with reference to its stop position was found at 7.5"
which confirms that the THS was selected to and was at 5
units Up position during the accident flight. The
trimmable horizontal screw jack assembly (S.No.481)
removed from the wreckage when examined in the shop
showed free movement of the ball nut on the screw jack.
There was no end play between the ball nut and the scre
jack threads. Also there was no damage observed on the
cable and drum assembly. The functional check indicated
that a torque value of 50-55 inch pounds was required to
operate the screw jack assembly against the maximum limit
of 84" pounds. The trimmable horizontal surface on the
right side had no damage due to impact except the tail
portion of the fuselage tilted to right and had caused
the THS on the right to buckle. An outboard portion of
the THS on the left side measuring 98" had earlier been
liberated from the main surface due impact with heavy
mass detached in flight after the left under carriage and
left engine thrust reverser had impacted the truck. The
remaining portion of the left THS retained with the
aircraft carry continuation of the damage on the leading
edge at the torn and inflight liberated section of the
left THS.
The rudder control surface had no evidence of
pre-impact damage and the rudder surface was found jammed

-42-
with its trailing edge at 6" to the left of its neutral
position. The rudder pedals in the cockpit were free to
take any position. The rudder trim knob in the cockpit
was to its full left beyond its graduation marking. The
rudder trim actuator piston inside the tail compartment
was in the extend position by 3/4th" corresponding to the
full right trim. This can be attributed to impact
damage. The rudder control PCU was found extended by 3"
which corresponds to 6" left rudder. The standby rudder
actuator piston was found extended by 3.5" which also
corresponds to 6° of left rudder.
The aileron surfaces on both sides of the wings
were found attached to the trailing edges of the wings
sections. The aileron trim selection in the cockpit was
set at 2.5" units to the left.
The elevator surface on the left side measuring
115" span wise was liberated soon
after impact of the
aircraft with the truck. The right side elevator was
intact and4ttached at its location aft of the right THS.
This elevator surface had buckling damage after the aft
fuselage portion had turned upside down and in its final
rest position and was tilted towards right supported by
the right THS outboard portion. The elevator Power
Control Unit S.No.8005 did not have any external damage
and was checked functionally in the shop and was found
satisfactory. No external leaks were also observed during
the testing. The elevator Power Control Unit on System
"1311S.No.2214 was also found satisfactory during the
functional check in as is condition and no leaks observed
during the testing. The elevator feel computer S.No. ES
608 was also tested in the shop as per the overhaul
manual procedures and no discrepancy observed.

A.12.6 Explosives :
The Bomb Detection and Disposal Squad Bureau of
Civil Aviation Security, Bombay, on carrying out
investigation at the wreckage on the very day of the
accident, has submitted that none of the typical
characterisitcs associated with on board explosion such
as metal fractures, spiked fragments, fissuring,
vaporisation on fragment surfaces, pitting, erosion,
flowering and curling was observed. The human bodies also
did not reveal explosion related signatures. The front
and rear cargo holds, retrieved baggages also give no
traces of explosion.
A.13(cid:9) MEDICAL & PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION
Toxicological testings of the blood sample of the
Commander , and the First Officer completed by the
Dy.Director, Regional Forensic Science Laboratory
Government of Maharashtra, Aurangabad, were negative for
alcohol and drugs. On their clinical examinations by the
medical officer, nothing adverse was detected.
A.14(cid:9) FIRE :
There was no inflight fire. Apparently there was
a fire after the impact,after the fuselage had split.
A.15(cid:9) POST MORTEM REPORTS :
As per Post Mortem reports about a dozen deaths
out of 55 were attributable to crash forces per-se. Most
of the deaths are as a result of post crash fire.Of the
eleven,five were having pelvic fractures and six spinal

-44-
fractures. Five died strapped on their seats and six
having spinal fractures died perhaps as a result of non
use of seat belts for whatever reasons.

certifications.
(e) The first 'three sectors of(cid:9)
the flight were
uneventful. The flight arrived at Aurangabad 25
minutes late at about 12.30 hrs.with total 79
passengers -61 bound for Bombay and 18 for
Aurangabad.
(f)
It was a hot summer noon. The halt at_Aurangabad
was 30 minutes. 51 passengers were boarded
there thus making a total of 112.
(g)
At Aurangabad,there was an unusually long
waiting list of passengers.
(h)
Capt. Mulherkar of IA (SOL) bound for Bombay met
P1 in the cockpit immediately after the flight
landed at Aurangabad and P1 asked the Trim Man
to accept Capt.Mulherkar and family consistiny
of 4 members within the RTOW.
(i)
P1 gave the RTOW of 42.6 Tons. ATOW as per L & m
Sheet was 42546 Kgs.
(j)
The ATCO gave runway 27 for the departure but on
request of P1, clearance by runway 09 was given.
(k)
The TORA as regards runway 09 was 6000' and the
TODA was 6360'. The width of the runway was
150'. The 3' high boundary wall of the airfield
is at a distance of 340' from the end of runway
markings. At about 6410' from beginning of
runway 09, outside the boundary wall lies a 20'
wide North-South Aurangabad-Beed State high way
running nearly perpendicular to the runway. High

-47-
way is situated 4.9' below runway end level.
Airport Obstruction Chart is Annexure-E.
Traffic on the road was shown to be regulated
(i)(cid:9)
during flying hours in the Obstruction Chart of
the Airport.
Mobile traffic on the road was regulated with
(m)
the aid of barriers and manned by staff of the
erstwhile Civil Aviation Department and State
Police from 1975 to 1984 or so.(cid:9) system of
regulation had stopped thereafter and it did not
exist on the eventful day.
(n) The aircraft commenced the rolling take-off at
13.05 hrs.and left mother earth at about 5800'
from the beginning of runway 09,i.e. virtually
of the end of runway. The aircraft impacted
with a lorry laden with cotton bales moving from
South to North at a distance of about 50' from
the boundary wall. The aircraft's left landing
gear, the left engine thrust reverser and APU
shroud drain mast impacted the left side of the
lorry in line with the centre line of the runway
at a height of 7' from the road level, 2.1'
above the runway end level.
(o) The aircraft turned to the left climbed some
height,thereafter started losing height, crashed
through nonlive high tension electric wires at a
height of about 50' from the runway end level.
It was dragged along the ground for some
distance. It impacted the trees, the fuselage
was split into two,and then it came to rest.
The fire broke out and the interior of the rear
portion of the aircraft was nearly completely
burnt.
(p) 53 passengers and two cabin crew received fatal
injuries at the crash site itself. One passenger

-48-
succumbed to the injuries later on.
(q) There were no impact marks on the runway surface
or on the boundary wall.
(r) The •FDR was recovered but the air speed and
altitude tracings were missing on the foil as the
respective stylus had disengaged from the
internal mechanism from the very start.
(s) During the whole take off stage from the time of
start-up clearance to the time of impact 25:06
to 32:34 as per time shown in transcript of CVR
(Annexure-F) no abnormality or emergency was
transmitted.
(t) When the aircraft was on the ground, there was a
talk about climb limit weight between P1 and P2.
It culminated in the utterance about 4 minutes
before the start-up by P2 to the effect
"everything is fine. Only nothing should happen
Yahi hai bus".
(u) As per "CVR transcript (i)Between the noting
"engine sound increases" in the transcript and
the stablised call, there was a 2 second interval
(ii) Between the stablization call and the Vr
call, there was a 27 second interval (iii)
Between the Vr call and the impact, there was an
11 second interval (iv) Between the Vr call and
the utterance of P1 "leave it leave it" there was
a 8 second interval with the absence of any
verbal communication.
B.1.1 Was the aircraft and/or engine performance
defective?
In the first place, it will have to be noticed
that on the fateful day, there were no carried forward
snags. The aircraft landed at Aurangabad with no

-49-
complaint having been made regarding its performance or
airworthiness. In the pilot defect report for the earlier
sectors, no entries were made. P2 (Wt.27) has clearly
stated that the sectors were uneventful and no snag was
experienced. AME posted at Aurangabad had carried out
the Check-A Inspection Schedule including walk around
security checks as indicated by the Inspector of Accident
Shri Gohain (Wt.1) in his report Exh.2. P1 (Wt.28) had
signed the Pilot's Certificate for General Fitness of
aircraft before flight at Aurangabad. P1 and P2 have
both confirmed in their statements (Exhs.134 & 29
respectively) that during the take off run, the engines
were operating normally and there was no abnormality and
that the take off run was smooth and the acceleration was
normal. Vr speed was attained within a distance of 4200'
at the timing of 32 seconds from commencement of the take
off run and within 27 seconds of the stabilisation call.
These timings and distances are nearly equal to the
optimum stipulated in the PEM for the existing
conditions.
In CVR transcript at the time 32:12, P2 informed
P1 that all engine parameters are normal. The aircraft
had already undergone a major C2 check and no fresh
inspection in respect of the engines was due at the time
of the accident. Engine Strip(cid:9) Investigation(cid:9) Report
attached to Exh.2 categorically states that there was no
basic failure of any part of the engines which could have
resulted in the loss of power of any of the engines.
There was no indication of an internal/external fire on
any of the engines nor any sign of uncontained failure.
'The said report clearly states that Engine 1 was running
at a lower RPM as compared to Engine 2 due to the impact
with the truck. The Pt7 ,probes along with their air

-50-
manifold on both engines were free from any blockage.
The Pt2 sense line in the nose dome of the respective
engines were also free from any blockage. The report
concludes with the statement that there is no reason for
any of the engines not developing sufficient power as and
when the same was demanded. No evidence on record
indicates any defect.
"'-
The conclusion is thus inevitable that both
engines were operating properly until the time when the
aircraft impacted the truck after which only as a direct
result of the damage sustained from the impact, the left
engine ran at lower RPM.
The aircraft was received by IA in 1974. It had a
Certificate of Airworthiness by the DGCA which was valid
upto 18th Apri1,1994 (Exh.145). At the time of accident,
the aircraft had accumulated 43888.45 hrs and 50557
cycles. The aircraft had flown 251.30 hrs since the last
flight release certificate, viz. Check C2 inspection had
been carried out. At the time of accident, 246 flying
hours were left for next major check as per Mr Mahapatra
(Wt.14).
Some doubt was attempted to be created on behalf of P1
about malfunctioning of Elevator Control System. But
suggestion appears to be altruistic. The PORT and STABD
elevators provide the primary pitch control of the
aircraft around its lateral exis. The elevators can be
controlled through two independent systems (i) manual
(ii) automatic through the autopilot system. The
autopilot elevator and pitch system consist of (i) the
pitch channel unit,(ii) the power control unit, and (iii)
the autopilot control panel. The flight crew are
required in the Before Take off Check list to confirm

-51-
before every flight that the elevator system is operating
properly. P2 had conducted such functional check of the
elevators before Delhi, Jaipur,Udaipur and Aurangabad
take off as admitted by her. In her evidence spe has
fairly confirmed the existence of free and full movement
from the elevators. There was no flight crew defect
report prepared on the elevator or any other aircraft
system.
Elevator system was operated without problem
manually by the pilot's movement of the control column
during the take off and landings at Delhi, Jaipur and
Udaipur and was operated without problem by the autopilot
system during the cruise phase of flight between these
cities and to Aurangabad. P2 is categoriCal in her
statement that the sectors were uneventful and the
flights were smooth. At no stage any snag on the aircraft
was experienced. Even P1 in his statement (Exh.29), did
not recall any
abnormality. The in-service performance
of the elevators on the three flights leading to
Aurangabad thus shows that the elevators were fully
functional. This confirmation was obtained when P2 pushed
and pulled the colualthrough the full range of elevator
travel and saw that the elevators had free and full
movement. The verbal acknowledgement that the elevators
were fully functional seconds before take off appears at
28:41
in the CVR transcript. No abnormality was
experienced or reported even during the take off roll.
There was no pilot complaint on the CVR about high or low
column forces, jammed controls or any other problem
whatsoever with the elevator system.
After the collision with the truck, the left
engine thrust reverser separated from the left engine and
crashed into the left horizontal stabilizer and the left
elevator, which were torn from the aircraft and were

-52-
found in a field immediately east of the Beed Road. Even
with only the right elevator and a part of the left
elevator operational, the aircraft was able to climb
approximately 50' above the ground at a distance of
approximately 3 Kms from the truck. Climbing movement of
the aircraft has been noticed by several witnesses like
Mr.Anil Machhar (Wt.4), Mr.S.K.Hussain (Wt.8), Mr.Gosavi
(Wt.13) and Mr.Shilpin Patel (Wt.21).
The elevator components were found tobe fully
functional in the examination shortly after the accident.
The investigators had also tested the elevator feel
computer which provides elevator feel to the flight crew
through column forces and found it to be satisfactory as
per Overhaul Manual as per Exh.2. From all these
circumstances, it is clear that the elevators were fully
operational during the accident take off.
Three factors are highlighted : (i) This aircraft
had. experienced three bird hits; (ii) number of
mal-functions with the autopilot system in the months
preceding the accident were reported; and (iii) the
elevator feel computer system may have suddenly failed so
as to inhibit the Captain's ability to accurately feel
elevator operation.
Now,.there is no material to hold that the bird
hit is indicative of elevator failure. Two of the three
bird hits experienced by the accident aircraft occurred
during final approach or landing when large elevator
inputs may not be appropriate. In none of the bird hit
events did the flight crew report having noticed a
problem with the elevator system as is clear from Exh.2.
It is true that there were a number of reported snags and
corresponding corrective actions with the autopilot

-53-
system as per Exhs.13 & 88. There were two types of
problems experienced when the autopilot system was
engaged, the stabilizer out of trim light illuminated and
the pitch channel tripped.(cid:9) These problems have no
relevance to the accident take off. The stabilizer light
and pitch channel snags were related to the autopilot
system; the snags existed only when the aircraft was
being flown by autopilot. The autopilot does not control
the elevators when the autopilot is disengaged. At the
time of the take off in Aurangabad, the aircraft was
being operated manually and the autopilot system was
disengaged as admitted by P2. This flight crew had
operated the elevators both manually and through the use
of the autopilot for earlier segments and there was no
problem with any part of the autopilot system. Even if
the snag in the autopilot system was there, it is
difficult to appreciate how that could have effected Pl's
ability to manually rotate the aircraft. On failure of
one of the two'hydraulic pressure systems that operate the
elevator feel control computer system "feel
differential" light illuminates in the cockpit's forward
overhead panel. The crew experienced no such problem.
As stated by Mr.Mahapatre (Wt.14) even with failure of
the system, the feel system will continue to operate
normally with only one functioning hydraulic system.
There is absolutely no material to indicate that the
aircraft and/or engine performance was defective and had
contributed or caused the accident. Therefore, this
point will have to be answered in the negative.
Undoubtedly there have been certain maintenance
lapses
and unexplainable and frequent repetitive snags in
the aircraft as is clear from evidence of Mr Gohain
(Wt.1) and Mr Mahapatra (Wt.14). Maintenance of aircraft
specially when it is old requires much more attention

-54-
Occurence of the repetitive snags
than it has received.
and non-placement of parts because the part number did
not match disengagement of styluses in the FDR are some
of the features which . are not healthy and the
explanations in this regard are not very convincing. But
that is a differnt part of the story.
B.1.2 Was there a sabotage by explosives or otherwise?
This possibility has to be completely ruled out.
a sabotage by
There is no material whatsoever to suggest
explosives or otherwise. It is no one's case either.
Mr.V.L.Jadhav of the Bomb(cid:9) Detection & Disposal Squad,
inspected the accident plane on that very day. According
to his report Exh.144 as well as Exh.2 both the forward
and rear holds were nearly intact with the retrieved
baggage inside showing no traces of any explosion. None
of the characteristics associated with on-board explosion
like metal fractures,spiked fragments, fissuring,
vaporization on fragment surfaces, pitting, erosion,
flowering and curling were observed.
The point is thus answered in the negative.
B.1.3(a): Was the aircraft over-loaded?
As per the L & M Sheet, the ATOW was 54 Kgs. less
than RTOW. IA asserted about correctness of the sheet at
the initial stage of Inquiry, but as the Inquiry
progressed, successive affidavits were filed before this
Court modifying the ATOW and the final figure given was
118 Kgs more than RTOW. In correctness of the L & M
Sheet to the extent of 172 Kgs is admitted at the end of
the Inquiry. The answer to the question, therefore, has
to be in the affirmative.

-55-
B.1.3(b): If yes, what was the extent of over-loading,
and its contribution in degrading the aircraft
performance?
It is nearly impossible to establish the exact
weight of the aircraft at the time of take off and
consequently the exact extent of over-loading. No direct
evidence is available. Reliance on inferences and guess
work is inevitable. Thus the endeavour has tobe made an
estimate which should be minimum wrong.
The original P & B manifest though allegedly
prepared by Mr Rapatwar (Wt.5) contemparaneously with the
checking-in has not seen the light. Anothe'r P & B
manifest,(Exh.28) has been produced. It is reported to
have been prepared by one Mr.Jain from IA who arrived at
Aurangabad in the evening of the fateful day. Several IA
officials including Mr.Rajendra Sahai (Wt.25) have
admitted that Exh.28 does not correctly reflect the
checked-in baggage of the passengers who boarded the
aircraft. It is pertinent tOnotice that every successive
re-calculation of the weight of passengers and baggage
with respect to this flight has revealed new mistakes.
Mr.Rajendra Sahai (Wt.25) asserted that the Baggage
Record Card System prevailed at Aurangabad at the
material time. No reference to this System was made to
the Inspector of Accident by any one. The card for the
relevant flight was not produced in the Court.
Mr.Rajendra Sahai promised to produce it after a day or
two. It was not produced even thereafter and he stated
that even after the search the documentwas not found and
Was perhaps destroyed after a few days of the flight
because there was no need. In the cross-examination,
he
admitted that during the search the cards for some other

-56-
flights of April 1993 at Aurangabad were found. All this
looks very unnatural. Estroying the card only for this
flight and that too after the accident cannot be in normal
course. Circumstances warrant drawing adverse inference
against IA for no (cid:9) of these vital documents.
The passengers, their hand baggage, checked-in
baggage and varieties of cargo comprised the pay load of
the aircraft. The baggage tags are serially numbered but
not accounted for. They are not even used serially.
such utilisation of baggage tags leaves scope for
manipulation and can create varieties of problems even in
case of a mistake.
The checked-in baggage reflected in the manifest
for Ex-Aurangabad passengers is too low. Average of the
checked-in baggage of 24 Ex-Jaipur passengers was over 10
Kgs per head and the average of Ex-Aurangabad passengers
was 2.5 Kgs per head.
The flight coupon has a provision for entering
the number of pieces of hand baggage and their weight,
but it appears that there is no practice of these details
being entered fully. It is very unlikely that any
passenger would have neither checked-in baggage nor hand
baggage. Those who do not have any checked-in baggage
would invariably have hand baggage and such hand baggage
is likely to be heavier. Only 7 Ex-Aurangabad passengers
had checked-in baggage as per Exh.28. It is on record
that some passengers were seen carrying heavy hand
baggages in the cabin one of them being Capt.Mulherkar.
In the whole background, it would be reasonable to assume
th4t the total hand baggages with respect of
Ex-
Aurangabad passengers must have considerably exceeded
the calculated in built passenger weight.

-57--
List of retrieved haggages,Exh.8. weight of which
was 1 ton shows that out of 83 parcels listed therein, 19
parcels were weighing in excess of 20 Kgs and some were
in the range of 18 to 20 Kgs. The claim of IA that a
retrieved baggage was in semi-wet(cid:9) condition and
therefore, that also ought to be taken into
consideration, does not appeal. Even if the baggage was
wet initially due to fire fighting operations, it cannot
remain in that condition for about a week in the hot
summer at Aurangabad. Water marks may remain but not the
water.
The aircraft had split into two.'-Rear portion
turned upwards. It suffered the most by fire. Only one
passenger Mr. Shilpin Patel (Wt.21) could 'survive. From
the photographs (Annexure-H) in the Album (Exh.79) it is
apparent that most of the baggage in the rear hold and
the hand baggage of the passengers in the rear must have
been burnt. It is in evidence of Mr. Gosavi (Wt.13) that
most of the salvaged baggage was from the front hold.
Even baggage in the front hold could not have been
intact. It is true as contended by IA that from few
examples of short delivery of baggage inference about
short delivery in every case cannot be drawn. So is the
case with examples of full delivery of baggage to which
my attention was drawn. In situations like this law of
averages has to be applied. Weight of checked-in baggage
is shown to be 740 Kgs. that of cargo only 3.6 Kgs. and
that of POT 58 Kgs. To this excess weight of hand
baggage (which is not calculated in the built in
passenger weight), weight of heavy suitcase carried by
passengers in the cabin, difference in the actual and
manifested weight - mistaken or otherwise - of the
luggage cargo etc. will have to be added. Kilo by kilo
calculation is too theoritical to be resorted to.

-58-
It is pertinent to notice that by telex message
(Exh.129) dated 25th April, 1993 issued by Aurangabad to
IA HQrs. a bigger aircraft was asked for on 26th April,
1993 to clear the committed load.
In the above background estimate the over-loading
by about 1 ton would be reasonable.
For slightly reasons the Inspector of
Accident has also estimated the over-loading by about 1
Some participants have supported this estimate.
ton.(cid:9)
According to IA the over-loading cannot in any case
exceed 500 Kgs. According to(cid:9) some(cid:9) participants(cid:9) over-
loading was much more.(cid:9) P2 has given the maximum estimate
at 4.65 tons as detailed below:
a) Over-load on account of excess
baggage(cid:9) ... 1.00 ton
b) Over-load on account of 32 extra
passengers, as explained above.(cid:9) ... 2.20 ton
c) Over weight condition on account
of 2° rise in temperature (as
stated by Mr.Gohain in his
cross-examination at page 20).(cid:9) ... 0.50 ton
d) Over weight condition on account
of RTOW not being obstacle limited
(as stated by Mr. S.K. Mukherjee
in the course of his cross-
examination at page 272).(cid:9) ... 0.95 ton
Total over weight condition
of aircraft.(cid:9) ... 4.65 ton

-59-
I will take up for consideration the estimate
given by P2 since this is the maximum figure suggested in
the course of oral hearing. No justification for these
figures and basis were shown from the record. Take for
example the weight of 32 passengers. No doubt Exh.129
gives a message that Aurangabad will not be in a position
to clear more than 80 passengers on the Basic/Advance
aircraft and in view of the committed load Dash -17
aircraft should be sent on 26th Apri1,1993-but from that
factor alone the weight of 32 passengers cannot be added
in calculating the over-load when RTOW has been
calculated on the basis of weight of 112 passengers. It
is true that the maximum booking reservation capacity
fixed for the flight for summer 1993 was 100 passengers-
but as rightly contended on behalf of IA, if the
passenger load is within the stipulated RTOW, no question
of over-loading can arise irrespective of the maximum
reservation capacity stipulated for the month. From the
evidence of Mr.Rajendra Sahai (Wt.25) it appears that IA
has a system of allocating load/capacity on various
flights/sectors for the purpose of reservation of seats
on confirmed basis. After a sector has been allocated a
particular passenger capacity, the central space control
will confirm bookings only upto the said allocated
capacity. Thereafter all bookings will automatically be
transferred by the computer to the waiting list. The
available pay load for a particular flight/sector is
computed keeping in view the lowest average monthly pay
load of that sector for the corresponding months/period
in the previous year. The allocation only determines the
total confirmed reservations that will be accepted and
has no bearing on the number of passengers that can be
actually uplifted on a particular flight depending upon

-60--
various factors. Of course, in no case the RTOW can be
allowed to be exceeded.
The possibility of exceedance of ATOW to such
higher degree has to be rejected even on scientific
basis, provided by simulation exercises. In all three
simulation exercises were carried out. The first was at
CTE, Hyderabad in June 1993 in presence of the Court, the
Assessors and the Inspector of Accident. Simulator at
CTE,Hyderabad is only a training Simulator not fitted
with type engine and got fitted with higher powered
JT8D-17 engine. As clearly confirmed by Mr.B.S.Siddhu on
behalf of CTE,Hyderabad in the letter (Exh.18) dated 13th
July,1993 the Simulator was unable to give quantitative
analysis, which was most essential in this Inquiry
considering the background of the accident. Vital
altitude and speed traces were missing from the FDR foil.
Hence aircraft-profile during take off with values of
speed, height, etc. could not be estimated. The aircraft
had prima-facie attained much lower height than the
prescribed height at the appropriate distance after lift
off. For these variety of reasons the Inspector of
Accident in his report (Exh.2) opined that simulation of
the aircraft performance with various deviation of loads
& rotation techniques in an engineering based performance
computer or any other Simulator having capacity to give
output in an exact quantitative manner was inevitable in
this Inquiry. The Assessors were also of the same view.
I was informed after making enquiry that the Boeing Co.
at Seattle has the engineering Simulator fitted with type
engine JT8D-9A. Government of India and the DGCA
contacted the Boeing Co. which readily agreed to provide
the simulation exercises.

-61-
Second simulation exercises were thus performed
in August 1993 in that Simulator in presence of the Court
and the Inspector of Accident. Exh.3 is the
supplementary report of the Inspector of Accident on the
gist of the result of the various exercises carried out
there. Exh.19 are the graphs of some of the exercises.
The results established that even with a weight of 44
tons and higher temperature and a normal rotation the
aircraft lifts off at 4905/4933' even after allowing 100'
for a rolling take off and is at an height of 35' before
5850'and with a weight of 42.5 tons and under rotation to
6° the aircraft lifts off at 5760-5800' and is at an
height of 3' at 6500-6600'. It is clearly established
that even an excess load of 1.5 tons could not cause a
lift off at 5800/5850' and this could only be caused by
delayed and/or slow and/or under rotation. Thus/late lift
off and lower climb gradient achieved in this case could
be attributable to the over weight if its extent was 6.5
tons as rightly stated by Inspector of Accident (Wt.l).
Third simulation exercises were reportedly
performed at CTE,Hyderabad on 16th October,1993 by the IA
at the fag end of the Inquiry without even informing the
Court. All of a sudden affidavit of Mr.S.K.Mukherjee of
CTE,Hyderabad was sought to be filed with a prayer to
examine him as a witness. The procedure followed by IA
and the prayer was vehemently opposed. Even though
course followed by IA was unusual, I granted the prayer
on 21st October,1993 in the interest of fair Inquiry
since the partiCipants were to have opportunity to
cross-examine him. Main thrust of testimony of
Mr.Mukherjee (Wt.24) has been that since Vr was achieved
at normal time and speed, over weight by more than
200 or 300 Kgs had to be ruled out. Now the results
obtained in CTE Simulator cannot suddenly become

-62-
quantitatively so fine as not to make allowance even for 1
ton exceedanceof weight. Its limited capacity and the
difference in engine power(cid:9) had not undergone any
change after first exercises in June 1993. Capt.Rao
(Wt.17) has categorically stated that difference in
weight by about 500 Kgs would make no difference in the
simulation results., In this background,this evidence
cannot be relied upon to hold that over weight was not
even by one ton.
Next aspect is whether the over-loading and/or
placement of excessively disproportionate baggage in the
forward hold of the aircraft or free seating of the
passengers had adversely affected the CG and consequently
aircraft's performance intake off phase. The.Inspector of
Accident (Wt.1) in Exh.2 as well as in his oral evidence,
has confirmed that even if 1 ton of under-manifested load
was placed in the forward hold, CG of the aircraft would
still have remained in the permissible range of 12% to
26% MAC. The CG, as indicated in L & M Sheet for the
entries therein for take off from Aurangabad, was 21.3 %.
Free seating of 112 passengers in the aircraft of 126
seats capacity would have negligible effect on the CG.
Mr.Rajendra Sahai (Wt.25) has deposed that having regard
to the well established concept of passenger choice
(window, aisle,remainder) free seating would not affect
CG. In any event in the flight which is substantially
full, there is a very little scope for passenger weight
imbalance. Free seating of the passengers even as per
Boeing Co. would have negligible effect on CC. In the
Trim Sheet format supplied, the cabin has not been
divided into three different zones for the purposes of
distribution of passenger load. The above stand of the
manufacturers is based on the well recognised concept of
passengers seat choice and the fact t'-at a margin for

-63-
passenger movement/change in allocated seats has been
built into the CG limits.
It is true that IA with the approval of DGCA had
subdivided the cabin into three compartments but that is
with a view to provide added safety margin. Boeing Co.
had permitted free seating on the basis of CG range from
5% MAC to 33% MAC: IA with the approval of DGCA has
.curtailed the range from 12% MAC to 26% MAC in order to
provide a further margin to take care of any difference
that might exist between the actual and calculated CG due
to passenger movement. Testimony of certain IA
witnesses from Aurangabad about putting all the
Aurangabad cargo in the rear hold only , even though load
destined to Aurangabad was off loaded from front cargo
hold appears to be unnatural but this feature cannot have
impact on the otherwise abundant and weighty material on
record.
It is, therefore, not possible to accept that the
distribution of load and free seating of passengers had
affected the CG beyond permissible limits and consequent
result was the requirement of additional input for lift
off and the proper climb gradient.
The possibility of over-loading and/or improper
loading even(cid:9) as a direct contributory factor to the
accident has to be ruled out in view of clear evidence(as
discussed later)(cid:9) about the cause of late lift
off and improper climb gradient of the aircraft which
resulted into the accident.
But it appears that the over-loading had an
indirect effect. Indirect effect was on P1's action due

-64-
to his consciousness about the over weight condition in
the hot summer time of the departure of the flight,
though he was not aware of the extent of over-loading.
Captain Mulherkar (SOL) who was a Senior Captain of IA,
had come to the cockpit with the Trim Man soon after the
flight's landing at Aurangabad with a personal request to
P1 to accommodate'him and his family (4 persons) in the
. flight which clearly indicated to P1 that there was rush
of wait list passengers. P1 asked Trim Man to accommodate
Captain Mulherkar in the flight within RTOW: It was hot
summer noon at Aurangabad. Temperature was rising. From
the Trim Sheet, it was clear that the ATOW was very close
to the RTOW. RTOW was calculated at 42.6 tons. Even on
the basis of the parameters considered by P1, RTOW would
have been 42.3 tons. The average weight of 4 passengers
with baggage etc. would come to 300 Kgs. It appears that
P1 deliberately added this weight to RTOW to avoid any
possible embarassment to the commercial staff in
accommodating Captain Mulherkar and his family when there
was a long waiting list of passengers. Calculations were
neither as per Metar nor as per any supposed observation
of the wind sock. P1 made very rough calculations and
stipulated a higher RTOW. Having done so it bothered
both P1 & P2, P1 thought that somehow he would be able to
take off, but he was not sure if the climb limit weight
will be crossed. P2, who was junior to Pl, however was
worried. All this is clear from the cockpit conversation
at CVR time 18:20 to 21:01. I reproduce for ready
reference the concluding part of the conversation at CVR
time 20:44 to 21:01.

-65-
"20:44 P2 P1 Hain right right acha aapne uska
thirty eight kar lya OK OK thik hai
thik hai.
P1(cid:9) P2(cid:9) Does not matter (cid:9) (laugh).
21:01(cid:9) P2(cid:9) P1(cid:9) Everthing is fine only nothing should
happen yahi hai bas."
P1 & P2's claim that the conversation in the
cockpit for almost two minutes with respect to the climb
limit weight was just of a theoritical and casual nature,
does not carry conviction. The matter was within the
special knowledge of the cockpitcrew and hence they were
duty bound to explain this unusual dialogue. Their
explanation is not convincing. The words "nothing should
happen" in the whole context cannot mean change in
temperature as was suggested by the cockpit crew. If
indeed the worry was about temperature, they have not
explained as to why they chose not to find out if the
temperature had changed before commencement of take off
even as fresh Metar was available at 1300 .hrs i.e. 5
minutes before the departure. They have not even given
explanation as to what they would have done at the
eleventh hour, if the temperature and other parameters had
changed. it is pertinent to notice that when the Trim
Sheet was brought for signature, P1 even did not bother
about the male, female, child distribution though those
figures were not available. The distribution was quite
important under the circumstances. P1 & P2 have accepted
in their
testimony that the response to a climb limit
weight could beadelayed rotation/lift off, resulting in
Additional speed
build up on the ground and a more acute
second segment climb. It is pertinent to notice that at

-66-
CVR timings 32:35 after the landing gear hit the lorry,
P2 instantaneously remarked "Shit Sir what have you
done."
The answer to this question, therefore, is as
under :
Over-loading was to the extent of approximately 1
ton. CG was within permissible limits. Over-loading did
not contribute in degrading the performance of the take
off. However, it had the indirect effect.
1381.4 Was there Commander's and/or First Officer's
error?
V speeds entered in the bug card were V1 = 126,
Vr = 128 and V2 = 132. These speeds were adjusted in the
indicator by P2. P2 has stated that she was continuously
monitoring the instruments from 80 kts to Vr call and she
had given the respective calls when the relevant speeds
were reached in the instrument. It is, therefore, safe
to conclude that at CVR time 32:12, 32:22 and 32:23 the
speeds 80 knts, V1 and Vr respectively were reached.
Luckily in this case the cockpit crew were available for
giving evidence about their decisions and actions which
can be divided for the purpose of analysis into two
stages. The first upto the moment of sighting the truck
and the second thereafter.
From the CVR as well as testimony of P2 & P2, it
is clear that the aircraft attained its Vr speed within
,32 seconds of commencement of take off run and within 27
seconds of stabilisation approximately 4200' down the
runway. That(cid:9) the aircraft left the mother earth nearly

-67-
runway is an admitted position.
at the end of
that the aircraft
Mr.S.K.Hussain's (Wt.8) statement
"27" painted at about
lifted off at about the digits
5800'from the beginning of runway 09 has gone
unchallenged. Considering the 6000'runway length the
aircraft failed to lift off for about 1800'additional
distance. It is also admitted position that nose of the
aircraft came up for the first time at CVR time 32:
30,i.e. approximately 7 seconds after the rotate call. I
have already held that the aircraft's degraded
performance could not be attributed either to the
defective performance or over weight. This failure can,
under the circumstances, either be attributed to (i)
delayed rotation and/or delayed rotation coupled with
conditions such
under rotation or (ii) the freak weather
as wind shear, temperature or down-draft. The later
possibility has to be ruled out. Neither at the time of
take off nor subsequently have the cockpit crew referred
to a sudden freak weather or to a sudden dropping off of
air speed in the ASI. This aspect is dealt with in
greater details separately at later stage under an
independent next topic.
There is mass of evidence to conclude that the
take off pattern was the consequence of delayed and/or
under rotation for nearly 5 to 7 seconds. According to
Mr.Sathe (Wt.11) not only was the lift off delayed but
the nose wheel coming up was also delayed. It is
pertinent to notice that during the entire period from
CVR 32:23 to 32:30 when the aircraft must have travelled
approximately 1800' on the ground neither P1 nor P2 made
any comment or displayed any consternation either by
statement or .gesture regarding the existence of any
abnormal situation. P1 admits that this delay in lifting
off was most normal. This establishes that P1 had taken a
mental decision to adopt a take off pattern

-68-
delayed lift off and low climb gradient in
entailing(cid:9)
first segment. That the aircraft lift off was late and
the climb gradient was much lower than(cid:9) expected, is a
conclusion also in the report (Exh.2). P1 & P2 have
admitted that the response to climb limit weight could
be a delayed rotation/lift off, resulting in additional
speed build up on the ground and a more accurate climb.
P1 has confirmed that the delayed rotation, slow
rotation and under rotation would all have the same
effect of higher take off speeds, longer take off
distances and enhanced climb gradient. Statement of P2 at
CVR timing 21:01 that "everything is fine only nothing
should happen "Yahi hai bas", has already been discussed
earlier. All circumstances indicate that the adopted
rotation technique was in fact a response to P1's
conclusion that the ATOW was exceeding the RTOW.
In the three statements made by P1 to the
Inspector of Accident immediately after the accident
(Exhs 29,30 and 31), he has stated that (i) the take off
run was smooth and acceleration normal,(ii) practically
the full length of runway was used for achieving V1 and
Vr speed, (iii) normal rotation had just been initiated
at about 500' from the runway end,(iv) when he saw the
lorry on the take off path, he pulled the control column
back and (v) nose went up but the aircraft did not climb
and the landing gear hit the lorry. Exhibits 133,134 and
135 are similar such statements of P2. P1's initial case
was of an abnormally delayed attainment of Vr speed at
5500' and spotting of the lorry just at the moment of
initiation of rotation, resulting thereafter in a fast
over rotation. The above version is not borne out from
the CVR transcript and other material on record to the
effect that Vr.speed had been attained by the aircraft
within the optimum time and distance of about 4200' and

-69-
about 32' seconds.
Realizing this P1 & P2 have departed from their
earlier statements in their testimony and stated that Vr
had been attained at 4200-4500'. To explain the long gap
of time and distance for the lift off after attainment of
Vr speed, P1 has belatedly come out with a completely new
and inconsistent case in the Inquiry and in his
testimony.P1's explanation that whenever he had referred
to Vr, he had meant lift off, cannot be accepted.
According to P1, he had initiated rotation 1 second after
the rotate call but the aircraft had not responded, this
had necessitated him to give additional input- as a result
nose wheel had come up though with difficulty and at that
stage he had spotted that lorry plying on the road. P2
has tried to support P1 but their versions about the time
and distance of the nose wheel coming up are quite
conflicting. According to P2, nose wheel first came up 7
seconds after the Vr and according to P1 it came within 4
seconds after the Vr.
Although the cockpitcrew had earlier stated that
they had seen the lorry immediately after the rotation
call and just at the point when rotation had been
initiated, P1 now stated that he had seen the lorry 4
seconds after the rotation call after he had given
additional input and when the nose wheel had already come
up to 6°. His explanation is untenable. P1 has made
number of inconsistent statements even in his testimony
including as to when he had seen the lorry for the first
time. He first stated that he saw the lorry just after
initiating the rotation when he was approximately 1000'
from the lorry i.e. at 5400' on the runway. This was
consistent with an initiation of rotation at 5400' and
approximately 6 seconds after Vr call. He subsequently

-70-
changed the version and stated that he saw the lorry for
the first time at CVR time 32:27 i.e. 4 seconds after the
Vr call, after he had allegedly given additional input
and when the aircraft nose had already come upto 6°, got
disoriented on noticing the lorry and did not react for
2 seconds and thereafter commenced a fast and over
rotation at CVR time 32:29. It is pertinent to notice
that even according to Pl, the aircraft body angle was at
6° at 32:29, i.e. about 6 seconds and about 1400' after
the rotate call. P1 agreed that failure of the aircraft
to lift off for 4 seconds after Vr necessitating
additional input even before he had spotted the lorry,
was extremely relevant abnormal feature. He had no
explanation to offer for not mentioning this in his three
earlier statements to the Inspector.
The position is clear that Vr was attained at
about 4100' and at 31:23 CVR time. At this point of
time, none of thedockpitcrew had sighted the lorry. In
fact the lorry was first sighted 5 to 6 seconds later.
Hence P1's reactions at 31:23 to the rotation call will
have to be viewed' in the context of not noticing the
lorry then. The claim of pilot reaction time
of
2 seconds to initiate rotation after the rotate call,
does not appear to be
convincing though provided by the
Operations Group in its report. During the take off, the
Commander has to be alert and in all attention to
the
crucial instruments and to anticipate situations. The
V1 and Vr calls from the First Officer are not wake-up
calls. As admitted,
even when the rotate call is
actually received, the Commander is ready and waiting for
the call to initiate rotation. At V1 call itself the
- bommander brings
the control column to central position
and would be keeping his eye on the ASI too. It is not

-71--
as if the Commander will initiate rotation only if the
P2 gives the call and not otherwise. Captain Rao (Wt.17)
has clearly stated that as the First Officer gives the
rotate call, the Commander too is just about starting the
rotation. Two seconds in take off path are crucial and
it means about consumption of about 450' runway.
Even if the margin of 1 second is given, rotation
call ought to have been initiated latest by 32:24 CVR
time. It is undisputed that on initiation of rotation,
the aircraft nose goes up. P2 has stated that the nose
of the aircraft had come to 6 to 7° body angle when she
looked out for the second time. According to the cockpit
crew the lorry had been sighted 4 to 5 seconds before the
impact, which means at CVR time 32:30. In•other words
the lorry was first seen about 6 seconds after the rotate
call. As stated by Captain Rao (Wt.17) the aircraft will
lift off in 4 to 5 seconds after rotation. Thus the lift
off should have occurred at 32:28 i.e. before the lorry
was sighted. If the lift off had taken place at 32:28,
the aircraft would have already achieved a height of
atleast 35' above runway level over the road at the time
of sighting the lorry. In such an event, even on
sighting the lorry, the P1 might not have "panicked" as
stated by him. By merely continuing the flight he would
have effected a take off climb without any cause for
concern.
Numerous inconsistencies in the testimony of P1
and P2 when viewed separately as also when compared to
each other exist. The late lift off has been belatedly
explained by various theories such as pilot reaction
time, requirement of application of additionalinput,
disorientation on suddenly noticing the lorry and total

-72-
non-reaction of two full seconds due to panic. In the
background stated above these explanations appear to be
altruistic.
P1 was a slow and unclear witness. He took time,
even to answer simple questions. His ability to
comprehend questions, formulate his answers and level of
professional knoWledge and confidence was very low. He
did not mind even equating rotation with lift off. He was
a slow learner as is clear from his professional and
training background as detailed in Exh.2. He failed even
in the routine annual performance refresher test. He was
required to be put through over 100(cid:9) extra LOFTS. He
had failed in the final route check. Capt Rao (Wt.17) not
only has confirmed statement about him in Ex.2 but also
explained the additional efforts and training required
before P1 managed to get PIC rating.
Low level professionalism and slow responses of
P1 led him to decide rashly that if he were to allow
extra' speed build up before initiating rotation, he would
be able to tide over the situation. In the process, he
did not almost certainly initiate rotation on rotate
call. But left few seconds to pass.(cid:9)
Allowing an extra
second perhaps would have made no difference. But he
consciously but recklessly took atleast 5 seconds to
(cid:9)
initiate rotation
and thereafter
suddenly pulled the stick on noticing the lorry.
All
incorrect decisions. As Capt.Rao (Wt.17) put it, P1 ought
to have continued the normal rotation even on noticing
the lorry and in that case without doubt the
aircraft
would have been atleast 25' high over the Beed-Road even
I
if with one engine after traversing 600'.

-73-
Some participants made a grievance about P1
choosing to have a rolling take off run. Advantages and
disadvantages of a rolling take off
as against static
take off have been explained by Capt.Rao (Wt.17). IA
policy allows full discretion to the Pilot for either
rolling take off, or static take off.(cid:9)
P1 cannot be
faulted for exercising discretion in a particular manner
especially when he had taken care not to lose any length
of runway.
Pilot error accounts for more aircraft
accidents
than any other cause. Pilot carries the highest risks
and responsibilities. Consequently,highest level of
skill and safety is demanded from him. Fading unexpected
emergencies is a part of his highly sophisticated
profession. No doubt even a pilot does not cease to be
human being and is bound to be distracted by an
unexpected emergency. But "panic" is an abhorrent word
for him. Continuation of panic condition for long is
quite obviously a dangerous situation. In this
background,becoming panicky on suddenly noticing a
running lorry on the road at the end of runway and
remaining in that condition for two seconds in a vital
take off phase was a clear example of total lack of
professionalism in P1. On his own showing he was an
inefficient pilot.
As noticed earlier, two vital parameters of
airspeed and altitude were missing from the foil in FDR
and hence the Corelation Chart
'of FDR and CVR where lift
off is estimated only from the not so reliable 'g' trace
looses its significance especially
when there is mass of
other evidence to determine the point of lift off.

-74-
Can P2 be also faulted along with P1 is the next
aspect. It is not possible to come to the conclusion
that P2 had consciously concurred with the Pl's incorrect
actions and rotation technique and take off pattern.
Though she was junior she had passed a polite but meaning-
ful remark that ,"everything is fine only nothing should
happen yahi hai bas". The system of functioning between
P1 and P2 is such that one cannot reasonably expect the
P2 to be more forceful. Her hands had gone
instantaneously near the column on realisation of the
incorrect action of P1 but P1 said "leave it, leave it"
as is clear from CVR time 32:31. At CVR time 32:35 she
remarked "shit, Sir what have you done". At CVR time 32:
53 also P1 remarked "Leave it,leave it". In the entire
background to expect her to take charge of the situation
from P1 would be too unrealistic.
There certainly exists one aspect which needs
consideration and that is about her supporting the wrong
stand of P1 in the testimony. She could have easily
deserted her senior in this Inquiry by passing the whole
buck upon him, but she chose a risky course of supporting
the senior colleague. Her attitude as a human being may
be worth appreciating but not as a responsible First
Officer who is expected to disclose whole truth in such
inquiries which are held in larger public interest of
taking measures to prevent the recurrence and collossal
loss of human lives. Public interest ought to have
prevailed over other personal considerations. But ideal
is not always practical in life.
To conclude this point, there was Commander's
error but not First Officer's error. The error was a
delayed initiation of rotation and following wrong
rotation technique in the take off.

-75-
B.1.5 Have the weather conditions - such as wind shear,
temperature and/or down draft adversely affected
the aircraft performance?
Schedule time of the arrival of the flight at
Aurangabad was 1205 hrs. It arrived at 1230 hrs, 25
minutes late Metar reports received from ATC, Aurangabad
(Exh.69) indicated to weather as follows at 12:30 hrs
(0700 UTC).
Winds 140/07 kts. viz 8 Kms
Clouds 4/8 2500' (750 m)
Temp. 38, DP 17, QNH 1012 HPa (29.90 in)
The flight departed at 1305 hrs (IsT). At this
time the Metar of 1300 hrs (0730 UTC) was available. The
said Metar was as under :
Winds 180/06 kts, viz 8 Kms
Clouds 2/8 2500' (750 m)
Temp. 39, DP 17, QNH 1011 HPa (29.88 in)
Mr. Sathe (Wt.11) was performing ATC duties at
the material time and it is clear that following
Meteorological information as available at 1200 hrs
(0630 UTC) was passed to P1.
Winds 210/05 kts, viz 8 Kms
Clouds 4/8 2500' (750 m)
Temp. 38, DP 17, QNH 1012 HPa (29.90 in)
As per the evidence, the winds between 1200 and
-'1315
hrs ranged from 3 to 12 kts. and the direction was
varying. DIWE revealed that from 1200 hrs till 1330 hrs

-76-
the winds were variable both in speed and directionand
the winds prevalent were shifting from North-East to
South-East. The CVR recording at times 12:26, 12:29, 12:
52, 13:00 mentions that at the time of approach/landing
by the flight to Aurangabad the winds were gusty and the
aircraft had experienced a sink, but that sink was
neither significnt nor abnormal. Cockpit crew chose not
to report even though they are required to report wind
shear condition. Aurangabad does not have any instrument
to detect low level wind shear. Accordingly, wind shear
cannot be detected on instrument and the same can only be
experienced by the aircraft.
P1 has stated in the earlier statements to the
Inspector of Accident that the aircraft's failure to lift
could be the consequence of wind shear/weather
phenomenon. However, both during the take off and even
subsequently, neither P1 nor P2 referred to any steep
falling off of air speed. ASI would drop suddenly in
case of a wind shear. In the CVR transcript, after the
rotate call, there is no reference to retardation by
weather phenomenon or wind shear. At the stage of oral
evidence and oral hearing, this possibility, so seriously
advanced earlier, was only half-heartedly put forward.
There is no other evidence also to hold that there was a
phenomenal change in the weather condition so as to
contribute to the degradation of the aircraft's
performance. Indeed, there is evidence to the effect
that the weather was clear.
The conclusion is thus inevitable that there was
neither wind shear nor down draft at the material time
Temperature at the runway must have been high, but this
was to the knowledge of Pl.

-77-
B.1.6 Was the Aurangabad airport and its surroundings
properly maintained?
Two aspects are highlighted (i) Absence of fixed
distance markers on the runway (ii) unregulated/
unnotified mobile traffic on Beed road beyond the
boundary wall of the aerodrome.
There were fixed distance markings on the runway
surface. They have specific pattern and distance
criteria. The fixed distance markers were not there on
or before the date of accident. Afterwords they have
been installed. These markers are short structures on
the runway .sides beyond the edge showing the distance
left for the end of that runway. Installation of these
markers are not mandatory under AIC. ICAO does not
recommend. But they are certainly useful. Because of
insistance of ICPA, now a policy decision has been taken
to install them at all airfields. it is stated that its
absence contributed to the accident in question because
the P1 had no means to know the length of consumed runway
in the take off. This is not correct.Capt.Rao(Wt.17) and
others have stated that there was no time/distance
criteria for attainment of V1 & Vr. P2 has admitted that
these markers are more useful for landings. For all
these reasons, it cannot be said that absence of these
markers has in any way contributed to this accident.
(cid:9)
The NAA has taken over the
airport in 1986
after its formation under the National Airports Authority
Act 1985, which has come into force with effect from 1st
June, 1886. Before that it was managed by DGCA. The NAA
' was duty bound to assess and limit obstacles to aircraft
operations even in the immediate proximity of the

-78-
aerodrome. Aurangabad airport has only one runway at
orientation 09/27. Annexure-I is the chart of Aurangabad
airport from Jeppesen Manual. The runway is. 6000' in
length and 150' in width. Since 1974-75 before which
runway length was 4500', TORA is 6000' for both the
runways. At the end of runway 09 there is a clear way of
360'. TODA for runway is thus 6360'. ASDA and LDA are
6000' for both the runway. There is no stop way at
either ends. Runway end lights on runway 09 are situated
at 6011'.(cid:9) There is a clear way of 329' comprising of
a paved surface of 184' and unpaved surface of 145'.
Immediately thereafter there is a boundarFy
wall. The
distance between the boundary wall and the middle of the
Beed road is 50'. The level of the Beed road is 4.9'
below the runway end level. Top of the wall is below the
runway end level. Under the ICAO Annexure 14 which has
been expressly made applicable to India under AIC 7 of
1976 dated 31st March, 1976 (Annexure-J), the obstacle
Clearance Plane is a surface starting from the end of
clear way. The obstacle clearance plane is at an
inclination of 2% (1:50) and any object which protrudes
above this plane is considered an obstacle which is
required to be limited/removed if possible. Obstacle
Charts are required to be prepared for all airports and
any object including mobile traffic which protrudes above
an inclined plane of 1.2% is required to bE noted in the
Obstacle Chart of the airport . The existence of
obstacles are also noted in the AIC/AIP for that airport.
If there is change in the situation depicted in the
obstacle chart and AIC/AIP or if there is a new obstacle
which is not
depicted on the obstacle chart, the Airport

-79-
Authority is required to issue a NOTAM bringing the same
to the notice of the airlines or the aircraft operators.
From 1985 the obstacle charts are prepared by the NAA but
are issued under the authority of DGCA after they are
received from the NAA. The assessment and limitation ()f
obstacles is under the purview of the NAA's Directorate
of Air Routes & Aerodromes. Regular surveys of the areas
in the vicinity of the aerodrome are required to be
conducted. As per the DARA(0) circular mobile traffic on
a road is taken as having a height of 5.5 meters
(approx. 18') for the purposes of obstacle limitation
and/or issuance of NOCs. Beed road is 4.9' below runway
end level and the centre of the Beed road is situated 50'
from the clearway and about 200' from the end of basic
strip. If the obstacle clearance plane is computed from
the end of the clearway, mobile traffic would protrude
12.1' above the obstacle clearance plane (18 - 4.9
= 13.1 - 1 = 12.1 ft.) and has a gradient of 26% against
the permissible 2%. If the obstacle clearance plane is
computed from the end of basic strip, mobile traffic
would protrude 9.1' above the obstacle clearance plane
(18 - 4.9 = 13.1 - 4 = 9.1 ft.) and have a gradient of 6%
against the, permissible 2%. The height of mobile taffic
'is to be computed at 12' only as indicated by Mr.
Mahalingam (wt.12). The traffic would protrude 6' or 3'
above the obstacle clearance surfface commencing from the
clearway or the basic strip respectively and would have a
gradient of 14% or 3% against the permissible 2%.
Drop barriers were installed on both sides of the
Beed road sometime in 1975 to regulate traffic from

-80-
plying on the road during aircraft operations and the
said barriers were in use till about 1985. Obstruction
Chart 9/1977 (Exh. 20) was prepared while Aurangabad
airport was under the control of the DGCA and at a
time when traffic on the Beed road was restricted
during the aircraft operations. The Obstruction
Chart shows barriers on the Beed road and accordingly
shows no obstructions for take off from runway 09.
AIC 16/1986 pertaining to Aurangabad (Exh. 72)
accordingly does not disclose the existence of any
obstruction for take off from runway 09. Sometime
during 1985 the practice of regulating traffic
along the Beed road during aircraft operations was
stopped.(cid:9) For the next several years the NAA and
its officials not only failed to take any steps to
regulate the traffic on the Beed road but also
failed to notify the DGCA and aircraft operators
that contrary to the AIC and the obstacle chart
(which depicted regulated traffic), traffic on the
Beed road was not being restricted during the
aircraft operations. In 1988 survey of Aurangabad
airport was conducted. No change was made to the
published obstacle chart or AIC. In September, 1991,
Senior Aerodrome Officer, Aurangabad forwarded to
the DGCA information for the updating of AIC 8/86.
Even at this juncture either the NAA or the Aerodrome
Officer failed to inform the DGCA that the obstacle
chart and AIC did not reflect the correct picture
about non-regulated traffic. In April 1992 an
obstacle survey of Aurangabad airport was
conducted.(cid:9) the(cid:9) survey(cid:9) map(cid:9) showing(cid:9) all
the obstacles in a tabulated form was

-81-
placed before the DARA(0) in October,1992. The survey map
clearly showed that mobile traffic on the Beed road
constituted first impact obstacle protruding 2.836 meters
(9') above the obstacle clearance plane. On enquiry
being made the surveyors categorically informed the
DARA(0) that traffic
on the Beed
road was not being
regulated during aircraft operations as is evident from
Exh.65 Sepetember 1992 survey map of the
aerodrome and
the testimony of Mr.Mahalingam. No steps were taken in
the matter of either limiting the obstacle by arranging
for regulation of the traffic during aircraft operation
or notifying the DGCA and aircraft operators that the AIC
and the obstcle chart did not correctly reflect the
ground reality vis-a-vis the existence of mobile traffic
on the Beed road. Mr.Mahalingam agreed that if traffic
on the road was an obstruction and was required to be
regulated it would be the duty of the NAA to take up the
matter with the approrpiate local authority for the
erection of barrIcades on the road. He further agreed
that once the NAA had learned that the obstcale chart OBS
9/1
977 did not correctly reflect the actual position
regarding the traffic on the Beed road, the NAA should
have issued a NOTAM or revised the chart. Nothing was
done. A policy decision was taken to ignore the matter
on the ground that
the obstruction was marginal. In the
cross-examination,(cid:9)
Mr.Mahalingam admitted that the
traffic as depicted in the NAA survey could not be
considered as marginal.
During
Apri1,1993, the NAA officers posted
at
Aurangabad comprised Mr.Ghate, Senior Aerodrome Officer,
Mr.Sathe, Aerodrome Officer and two Assistants. It is
clear that none of
them was either aware of their duties
or responsibilities in the matter of assessing and

-82-
limiting the obstacles or refused to bother themselves on
this subject. According to Mr.Ghate (Wt.10), it was not
the duty of NAA officers at Aurangabad to examine whether
anything constituted on obstacle or not. Mr.Ghate agreed
that if he found an obstacle not disclosed in the AIC he
was duty bound to caution pilots and also attempt to have
the same removed. He agreed that from survey chart
(Exh.65) he was aware that mobile traffic on the Beed
road constituted first impact obstacle not disclosed in
the AIC. Mr.Ghate's stand is that he was concerned only
with area within the aerodrome boundary walls and was not
concerned with anything beyond it. He agreed that before
keeping watch he was required to study the Aurangabad
obstacle chart OBS 9/1977(cid:9) and(cid:9) that if he had seen
the chart he would have realised that traffic on the Beed
road was required to be regulated as the traffic on the
Beed road would constitute an obstacle and that his
earlier statement to the contrary was incorrect.
In the RTOW chart .for runway 09 there is no
provision for such an obstacle. Aurangabad is a short
field runway and it has been shown that an obstacle of
7.1'situated 400' from the runway end would result in
reduction by 600 Kgs of the climb RTOW.
As late as in September 1992, survey was
conducted by NAA. Survey report (Exh.65) shows that the
mobile traffic on the road has been shown as first impact
point. Inspite of the gates being shown on all
obstruction charts of Aurangabad airport and the
officials of NAA being aware that traffic was not being
controlled in the course of daily aircraft movement, NAA
did not change or cause to be changed the AIC of
Aurangabad airport Exh.72. It is pertinent to notice that

-83-
The AICs of certain other airports such as Jaipur where
mobile traffic on the roads immediately outside the
vicinity of such airports is operating, reflects the
mobile traffic as obstructions in approach and take off
areas as is clear from AIC Exh.74. Mr. Mahalingam has
admitted that the DGCA was not informed that there was a
change in the ground situation regarding the existence of
unregulated traffic on the Beed road. Mr. Sathe (Wt.11)
has admitted that it would be his duty to report any
obstacle within 20 Kms radius of the aerodrome and that
he realised that it was a mistake not to anticipate
moving traffic as a hazard.
Under all these circumstances, the conclusion is
inevitable that there has been a failure and neglect on
the part of the NAA in not regulating the traffic on the
Beed road during aircraft operations. In any case
(cid:9) the
absence of regulation of mobile traffic ought to have
been shown in the obstacle charts. Atleast NOTAM about
the changed condition of unregulated mobile traffic ought
to have been issued.
IA's submission is that had correct position been
disclosed, the climb RTOW would have been reduced by 600
Kg. since Aurangabad is a short field runway and had an
obstacle of 7.1' (12 - 4.9) situated 400' from the
runway. According to IA, P1 planned his take off profile
and speeds on the basis that there was no obstacle in the
take off path during the first segment and this feature
had contributed to the accident. This submission is not
correct. It cannot be said that either IA or the ICPA or
cockpit(cid:9)
crew operating from Aurangabad airport had no
knowledge of the existence of unregulated mobile traffic
on the road. P1 has stated in his testimony that he had

-84-
operated from Aurangabad several times before, when it
did occur to him that the traffic on the Beed road could
be a hazard. ICPA Regional President Capt. Ashar (Wt.22)
has also admitted that he had himself operated from
Aurangabad several times and had seen moving traffic on
the said road from the flight. Mr. Surender Kumar (Wt.7)
in his testimony,'has made no secret of the fact that
during his duty at the Auranabad the feature of not
putting the cross bars on the Beed road did strike him,
there was discussion about this feature between the
officials of IA at Aurangabad but he did not bring this
to the notice of any one. It is unfortunate that even an
active body like ICPA has failed to take up this serious
matter with the appropriate authorities for number of
years. Everyone showed indifference towards this serious
matter and is now trying to pass the buck on the other.
Stoppage of practice of regulation of mobile
traffic is a typical and classic example of communication
gap/absence of interaction between the high officials as
well as the responsible public bodies. Some times the
price of an indifferent and callous attitude can be
heavy. Nation as well as individuals had to pay it in
this case. It may however be mentioned that after the
accident the traffic has been regulated during operation
timings by the NAA with the aid of local police.
The NAA has raised certain legal issues. One is
that AIC No. 7 of 1976 issued by DGCA applying the
standards and recommended practices contained
in ICAO.
Annexure 14 has no legal force. India is a Member State
of the ICAO. A large part of the law relating to Civil
Aviation is directly or indirectly derived from
provisions of conventions on international aerial

-85-
navigation.(cid:9) They are in the nature of multilateral
treaties between States and form part of our municipal
law to the extent they are applied to India by our laws.
In this context, Sections 4, 5 and 5A of the Aircraft
Act,1934 and Rule 133A of the Aircraft Rules 1937 framed
thereunder are relevant. Section 5 refers to the general
rule making power of the Central Government. Sections 4
& 5A & Rule 133A are reproduced below for ready reference.
"4. Power of Central Government to make
rules to implement the convention of 1944-
The Central Government may, by notification
in the Official Gazette,make such rules as
appear to it to be necessary for carrying
out the Convention relating to International
Civil Aviation signed at Chicago on the 7th
day of December,1944 (including any Annexure
thereto relating to international standards
and recommended practices) as amended from
time to time."
"5A. Power to issue directions- (1) The
Director General of Civil Aviation or any
other officer specially empowered in this
behalf by the Central Government may, from
time to time, by order, issue directions,
consistent with the provisions of this Act
and the rules made thereunder, with respect
to any of the matters specified in clauses
(b),(c),(e),(f),(g),(h)(cid:9) and(cid:9) (m)(cid:9) of
sub-section (2) of section 5, to any person
or persons engaged in aircraft operations or
using any aerodrome, in any case where the
Director General of Civil Aviation or such

-86-
other officer is satisfied that in the
interests of the security of India or for
securing the safety of aircraft operations
it is necessary so to do.
(2) Every direction issued under
sub-section (1) shall be complied, with by
the person or persons to whom such direction
is issued."
"133A. Directions by Director General - The
Director General may, through Notices to
Airmen (NOTAMS), Aeronautical Information
Circulars (AICs) Notices to Aircraft Owners
and Maintenance Engineers and publication
entitled civil airworthiness requirements,
issue special directions not inconsistent
with the Aircraft Act, 1934 (22 of 1934) or
these rules, relating to the operation, use,
possession, maintenance or navigation of
aircraft flying in or over India or of
aircraft registered in India."
By virtue of authority conferred by Section 4, Rule 16
of the Aircraft Rules has been made and Schedule IV to
the Rules contains such of those ICAO annexures which
are made statutorily binding in the country. Annexure
XIV does not find place in that schedule. The
submission is that the only way to enforce Annexure XIV
is through special provisions meant for the topic
contained in Sec.4 of the Aircraft Act and no other.
Based on this very reasoning is the next submission that
Rule 133A is ultra-vires the Act. The submissions
cannot be accepted. Section 5A empowers the DGCA or any

-87-
other specially empowered officer to issue by an order
binding directions with respect to any of the matters
specified in Clauses (b), (b) to (h) and (m) of sub-
section (2) of Section 5. The only limitation put on
the directions is that they should be consistent with the
provisions of the Act and the Rules made there under.
Any order under Section 5A which is not inconsistent with
the provisions of the Aircraft Act and the Rules made
there under is valid and the only fact that such order
pertains to the ICAO Annexure would make no difference.
Rule 133A is quite specific. It does not violate the
source of its existance viz. Sections 5, 7 & 8(2) of the
Act. •
It is contended that when a statute prescribes a
method to do certain act or thing it can be done only in
the manner prescribed and in no other manner. In support
of this proposition my attention was drawn to some
decisions including the well known case of State of
Gujarat vrs Shantilal Mancialdas AIR 1969 SC 634. The
context of the decision is altogether different.(cid:9) Basic
principle is well settled but it cannot be applied in a
vacuum. All depends upon the letter as well as spirit of
the enactment concerned. The purpose & whole scheme of
the enactment has to be kept in mind and various
provisions are to be read together and not in isolation.
So read,required authority in the DGCA is ample. It is
clear that DGCA can issue special directions even on
matters covered by any ICAO Annexure and(cid:9) bring it
into force even though it is not made applicable by the
Central Government through rule making power, provided
the directions are not inconsistent with the Act or the
Rules. AIC No.7/1976 is one such valid direction and has
binding effect. Indeed it is so treated and acted upon

-88-
by the NAA so far and it is too late into the day to
question its validity.
The second legal submission is that the Beed
road, being outside the boundary wall of the airport
could not be regulated by the NAA under the National
Airports Authority Act, 1985 and the Rules & Regulations
made there under and hence it was not a part of its legal
duty to regulate it. Section 2(i) of the NAA Act states
that words and expressions used in the Act but not
defined shall have the meaning assigned to them in the
Aircraft Act. Section 12 of the said Act specifies the
functions of the NAA. Section
12(3)(c)(j)(o) & (p) are
relevant. Section 33(1) is important. it reads thus :
"33.(1) The Authority or any officer specially authorised
by it in this behalf may, from time to time, by
order, issue directions, consistent with
provisions of the Aircraft Act, 1934, and the
rules made thereunder, with respect to any of the
matters specified in clauses (f), (h), (i), (j),
(k), (m), (p), (qq), and (r) of sub-section (2)
of section 5 of that Act, to any person or
persons engaged in aircraft operations of using
any aerodrome of civil enclave, in any case where
the Authority or the officer is satisfied that in
the interests of the security of India or for
securing the security of the aircraft it is
necessary to do so."
Section 38 is the Regulation making power.
Section 38(2)(h) empowers the NAA to make regulations
,providing for "securing the safety of aircraft, vehicles
and persons using the aerodrome or civil enclave and-

-89-
preventing danger to the public arising from the use and
operation of aircraft in the aerodrome or civil enclave".
At this stage the definitions of the words
"Manoeuvring area" and "Movement area" given under Rule 3
of the Aircraft Rules call for attention. They
respectively read'as under :
"manoeuvring area" means that area of an
aerodrome which is to be used for the
take-off and landing of an aircraft and for
the movement of aircraft associated with
the take-off and landing.
"Movement area" means the area of an
aerodrome which is inteded for the surface
movement of an aircraft and includes the
manoeuvring area and aprons.
The Beed road just touching the boundary wall
cannot fall outside the area controllable by the NAA
:
Indeed it was never so treated so far. Mr. Sathe (Wt.11)
has ultimately agreed that it was his dutY-to report any
obstacle within 20 Kms radius of the aerodrome.
My attention was invited to Section 9A (cid:9)
of the
Aircraft Act pertaining to the power of the Central.
Government to prohibit or regulate construction of,
buildings, planting of trees etc and so also Section 13
of the Indian
Railways Act which provides that the
Central Government may require that, within a specified
time suitable gates, chains, bars stiles or hand-rails be
erected or renewed by the railway- administration- at-
places where railway crosses a public road on the level

-90-
and further that persons be employed to open and shut
such gates, chains or bars etc. It is true that no such
specific power is to be found in the NAA Act. It is also
true, as rightly contended on behalf of the NAA, that the
NAA Act is vague and unclear leaving scope for avoidable
controversies and waste of public time and money inp
resolving them and that it deserves to be dressed up
properly by legislative amendments. But this desirable
feature will have no effect on the matter at hand. Hence
it is clear that the NAA had failed to maintain the
Aurangabad airport's surroundings properly.
B.1.7. (a) Does the Aurangabad airport require
improvement?
(b) If yes, in what manner?
Aurangabad is a major tourist centre on
international map and attracts rush of not only national
tourists but also international tourists. it is also a
fast developing industrial town. Many times there is a
rush of air passengers. Aurangabad's climate_is generally
hot. In Summer season it is extremely hot and this season
lasts for a long time. Flights operate also in the noon
time when temperature is at its peak. It has short
runway. There were occasions when the Commander refused
to fly the aircraft without off loading either the
passengers or the cargo, as a result the flight was
delayed. Mr.Anil Shah (Wt.26) has given account of his
frustrating experience on 16th Apri1,1993 on the very
flight at Aurangabad. Capt.Tyagi refused to fly due to
over loading. There
was continuous delay and flight took
off only after passengers were off loaded twice. Thd

-91-
first improvement that is needed is the extension of
runway,preferably towardsbeginning of runway 09 and by
additional 3000.' and/or shifting of the Beed road at the
end of 09. It is stated that mush-rooming of
constructions adjoining the runway is of great magnitude.
This also needs be checked forthwith.
The mobile traffic on Beed road adjoining the
boundary wall was initially regulated for number of years
during flying hours but since 1985 or so, the regulation
had been stopped. Now, the stop barriers have been
installed and the traffic is being regulated. This
practiceimust not be stopped until the ground situation is
materially altered.. The fact that there are practical
difficulties in guarding the barriers is no reason to be
slack in the performance of duty.
Airports are designed and constructed to provide
relief and comfort to passengers after flying in a
cramped,uncomfortable flying machine. Airports all over
the world are conceived as technological dream spaces,
equipped with the latest array of electronic and
mechanical equipments and presenting a dazzling spectacle
of modern transport. In India passenger terminals often
resemble rural railway stations and the facilities
available or rather the lack of them do not present a
good picture of the country's civil aviation record. it
is true that ideal is not always practical since there
are many constraints, but the goal has to be ideal. All
improvements cannot be made in a day or two and
will have
to be done in,phases but beginning has to be made.
Aurangabad airport needs extension and
modernisation. Even the ordinary facilities are sadly

-92-
lacking. During our team's first visit to Aurangabad, we
noticed that the view of the runway
(cid:9) 09 and Beed road from
the ATC tower was hazy because
the glass was not
transparent and this had to be brought to the
notice of
the tower officer. Fixed distance
markers were not
installed at the time of accident, but
now they have been
installed. It is,
necessary to provide ATIS
broadcast
service to ensure that latest weather and
other
information is available to the cockpit crew.
Modern
landing system should also
be installed. No doubt all
this requires finance which
is scarce but from the long
range point of view this may be more economic and
profitable.
B.1.8. Were adequate post-
accident actions taken by the
crew, the Indian Airlines, the National Airport
Authority or local authorities?
Fire fighting team at the
airfield was in the
state of preparedness during the take off stage. This is
clear from the fact that even before crash siren was
heard, Mr. Gosavi (Wt.l3) on seeing something falling off
from the underside of the aircraft, started off with his
vehicles in the general direction of the aircraft.
Several passengers and the surviving cabin crew have
stated the CFTs and ambulance reached the scene of crash
within a few minutes.
Fire service
for this flight was of the required
category V as per
IA Operations
Manual. Aurangabad
airfield has Cat.V fire service. Mr. Sathe (Wt,
11)
testified that earlier in the day because one CFT had
started giving trouble the category was wrongly brought
down to IV. The earlier flight IC-492 was accordingly

-93--
forewarned before landing and the flight was operated.
After discussing with Mr.Gosavi, Mr. Sathe subsequently
realised that even with the remaining CFT the category
could be maintained at V because of its capacity and the
nature of
the foam used. Accordingly during the
operation of the illfated flight IC-491, the fire service
was of category V. As a matter of fact even the CFT
which had earlier given trouble was put into operation a
litte later. The
local authorities such as Police,
Municipal Corporation, all reached the spot with their
men and machinery within reasonable time and took all
reasonable steps which were possible under the
circumstances to remove injured to the hospital. There
was great confusion and consequent delay 'no doubt, but
not major failure to take actions.
Some passenger witnesses made a complaint
about
the cold indifferences of the crew barring the cabin crew
Mrs.Dabas (Wt.6),towards them after they came out on the
ground. It is in evidence that cabin crew
Mr.Nim (Wt.9)
had himself become injured. Hence he could not have
helped much. According to the witnesses, P1 was just
standing in silence in a corner after jumping out from
the cockpit window. Pl's statement is that he jumped
inside the cabin from the front door to save passengers.
Evidence
about P2's role is conflicting. There is no
t
clear evidence tofind fault with the crew on this aspect.
There
was some debtate also about the cockpit
crew not declaring emergency after the aircraft hit the
lorry. This was primarily and essentially a duty of Pl.
One view point was that emergency ought to have been
declared. The other was that
it
was risky since theie
would have been a panic in the cabin which would have

-94--
perhaps led to
more damage and that there was really no
time. Both
the points of view are quite balancing. In
this situation, benefit of doubt has to be given to the
cockpit crew on this aspect.
Thus taking overall picture in view, this point
will have
to be answered in the affirmative.
B.2(cid:9) OTHER OBSERVATIONS:
Capt.Mulherkar (SOL) was a factor in the
accident. The
existing IA's system of no reservation, no
waiting list for SOL passengers is most unsatisfactory,
counter productive,embarrassing and impractical. It often
has a strain on the healthy relationship that is
necessary between employer and employee. Situations like
the one which have arisen in this case viz requirement of
out of way accommodating and obliging a colleague in
violation of the policy must be commonly arising.
Feeling of brOtherhood and mutuality of interest is
human. This leads to temptation to cut corners in order
to accommodate a colleague and indulgence in practices
which are not conducive to the safety of operation of
flight. Leave Travel Concession by rail/road is not
available to IA employees, even as an alternative in lieu
of free/concessional air passage. From the above
entitlement it can be seen that there is no way in which
the staff can plan its holidays due to uncertainty of
availability of flight. The situation of SOL being
required to come to the traffic counter to ascertain if
there is any seat available after all the fare paying
passengers are checked-in, is very awkward. Embarrassing
situations of going through frustrating experience of
carting the family including children to the airport and
drawing blank at the last minute because the ticket is
'subject to load' have to be dispensed with. Denial of

-95-
the seat in the very airline in which one is working
cannot create goodwill for the employer. Undoubtedly,
huge finance is involved considering the large number of
employees but proper balance can be struck, if
necessary,
by giving reduced number of confirmed concessional
tickets or by giving option to have Leave
Travel
Concession by other transport.
The IA Pilot training leaves much to be desired.
Even Sivaraman Committee Award states :
"IA should meticulously examine indepth the
existing training procedures in the Central
Training establishment, Hyderbad, in such a
manner(cid:9) that(cid:9) discipline - to(cid:9) observe
meticulously rules and regulations during
flights is inculcated among pilots."
Training by mock exercises for evacuation in
unexpected
emergencies does not exist. This has
a
potentiality
of panic situations when such emergencies
actually arise, as happened in this case. One passenger
Shilpin Patel (Wt.21) could though with great difficulty
and in an injured condition, come out of rear exit but
air-hostess Mrs.Laxmi Raman Yadav could not even open her
seat belt and met with an unfortunate death in a hanging
position tied to the seat belt when the rear fuselage
turned up side down.
Moreover, it seems to me that saree is not a very
proper dress for the air-hostess.
It can create
difficulties in emergency operations and hence alternate
dress, preferably Salwar-Kameez, can be thought of for
them.

-96-
P1's poor & dismal record of training has been
already noticed. He seems to a "pushed up" candidate.
Extra care ought to have been taken before issuing to him
a PIC grade. No attention seems to have been paid to his
record even thereafter. He was freely allowed to operate
even on critical airfield like Aurangabad and that too in
hot summer. This was an undesirable feature.
There have been repetitive snags in certain spare
parts. Maintenance of spare parts leaves much to be
desired. Disengagement of two styluses in the FDR from
the very beginning was an unfortunate classic example of
absence of work ethics. No proper explanation about the
circumstances in which that could happen.is forthcoming.
It is extremely necessary that CVR and FDR are
periodically monitored for ensuring compliance with
safety rules.
Heavy hand baggages were freely allowed in the
flight. More effective control and regulations
pertaining to checked-in as well as hand baggage is
necessary. Large size hand baggage is a safety hazard as
it blocks the emErgency exit passages. It can also
result in over-loading since the average weight of hand
baggage taken into account is only 4 Kgs. Hand baggage
limit of size 115 cm (sum of length, breadth and height)
should be strictly enforced and the airport
security should be entrusted with this responsibility as
the airlines may not be in a position to enforce it. A
basket type measure /device of appropriate size i.e. 115
cm.
total of length, breadth and height should be
9(cid:9) provided at the
airline's check-in countler as is done by
some foreign airlines. Only that hand baggage which can
fit in that measure and no other, should be permitted.

-97-
No passenger could open exit window. Pre-flight
briefing of passengers, particularly those seated near
location of exits should be strictly enforced and it
should be assured
that only those passengers who can
operate the emergency exit be allowed to sit near those
exits.
Agitations are started by the ICPA at the drop of
a hat even on smaller personal issues without bothering
for passengers convenience, but the public issue like
unregulated mobile traffic on Beed road was never taken
up though that feature was well known even to the Pilots
and the ICPA.
Evidence on record clearly establishes the total
communication gap between officials of the NAA about
regulation of mobile
traffic on Beed road. Each has tried
to pass the buck on the other. Responsibilities of the
officials are not fixed and specified and this is one of
the causes for undesired situations. There is also a
communication gap
between different public organisations
like, the IA & NAA.
Work culture/ethics is also lacking
leading to disasterous results. Serious attention to
improve upon the fast deteriorating conditions has to be
paid by all concerned, failing which credence will be
provided to current propoganda of the IA being at the
lower rung of performance record as compared to other
airlines.
I am informed that several recommendations made in
earlier Reports under Rule 75 of the Aircraft Rules
(which have been accepted by the Government) have not been
implemented despite lapse of considerable time.
Constitution of Court for Inquiry is not just an empty

_98-
formality to be performed. There is no use of having
these Inquiries in case even the accepted recommendations
are not implemented. There has to be an inbuilt
mechanism to implement them.

C. CONCLUSIONS
C.1(cid:9) FINDINGS :
1.
There was no defect either in the aircraft or in
the engine performance.
2.
There was no sabotage by explosives or otherwise.
3.
The aircraft was over-loaded. Its extent was
about 1 ton. However, this over-loading as such
did not contribute in degrading the performance of
the aircraft.
(cid:9)
4-.
There was Pl's
error in initiating
delayed
rotation and
in following wrong
rotation
techniques.
5.(cid:9) Weather condition
did not affect the aircraft's
performance.
6.
Aurangabad airport and its surroundings were not
properly maintained. The NAA failed to perform
its duty of regulating mobile traffic on the Beed
road during aircraft's operation. The NAA alsc
failed in not showing the unregulated traffic in
the Obstacle Charts and also not issuing NOTAM
about stoppage of practice of regulating traffic.
7.
Aurangabad airport requires improvements. Those
improvements include (i) extending the runway

-100-
length preferably by additional 3000' (ii) making
permanent arrangement about regulating the traffic
on the Beed road, and (iii) providing modern
facilities at the airport considering Aurangabad's
importance as an international tourist centre and
developing industrial town.
8.(cid:9) By and large adequate post-accident actions were
taken by the NAA and others.
C.2(cid:9) CAUSE OF ACCIDENT :
Causes of the accident were(i) Pilots' error in
initiating late rotation and following wrong rotation
technique, and (ii) failure of the NAA to regulate the
mobile traffic on the Beed road during the flight hours.

-101-
PART - V
D.
RECOMMENDATIONS
1.
Urgent steps for implementing the accepted
recommendations made in the earlier Reports should
be taken.
2.
The National Airport Authority Act 1985 should
be suitably amended, inter-alia by incorporating
specific provisions on the lines of Section 13 of
the Indian Railways Act, for regulation of mobile
traffic as regards roads close to the runways.
3.
AICs/Obstacle Charts for all airports and the
conditions prevalent at such airports and their
vicinity should be jointly reviewed annually by
the NAA, DGCA and the Operators.
4.
The Senior Aerodrome Officer at the airport should
be expressly entrusted with the duty of assessing,
noting and limiting the obstacles in the vicinity
of that airport.
5.
The Senior Aerodrome Officer should also be
required to carry out the regular surveys in the
area of vicinity of the airport and must be
required to forthwith communicate the NAA
Headquarters and the Operators, the existence of
obstacles not noted in the AICs/Obstacle Charts.
6.
The NAA must communicate to the DGCA and all
Operators of any obstacle which is not noted in

-102-
the AIC/Obstacle Chart and pending that, must
forthwith issue NOTAM regarding the existence of
the same.
7.
The Senior Aerodrome Officers and ATC officers
must be trained in all respects of the assessment
and limitation of obstacles.
8.
The clarification should be made to indicate the
precise duty and power of the DGCA, NAA and
Government in the matter of control and limitation
of obstacles in the vicinity of an airport.
9.
Runway of Aurangabad airport should be extended
preferably by additional 3000' towards beginning
of runway 09. Airport should be modernised by
providing modern landing systems & ATIS broadcasts
service to ensure that the latest weather and
other information is made available to pilots.
10.(cid:9)
Beed road should be shifted. Permanent suitable
arrangement to regulate the mobile traffic during
flight hours should be made.
11.
Since the statutory Notification SO-988, dated 5th
January, 1988 issued by the Government of india
does not either specifically refer to the clear
way or give any special definition of "clear way",
the Notification should clarify the whole position
including about the starting point of Obstacle
Clearance Plane and/or about the point at which
the aircraft should be at 35' height.

-103-
12. Extra care ought to be taken before giving grade
of PIC in cases where the grade is made with
difficulty.
13. Mock exercises for evacuation in emergencies
should be provided for in the training of both cabin
& cockpit crew by the IA.
14. Prescribed dress of air-hostesses should be
changed since saree can create obstacle in
emergency operations. Salwar Kameez dress or any
other suitable dress may be better.
15. Hand baggage limit of size of 115 cm. (sum of
length, breadth and height) should be strictly
enforced and the airport security should be
entrusted with this responsibility.
16. A basket type measure or device of appropriate
size i.e. 115 cm. (total of length, breadth and
height) should be provided at 'the airline's
check-in counter as is done by some foreign
airlines. Only that hand baggage which can
fit in
that measure and no other, should be permitted.
17. Greater inter-action between Operators, Crew, NAA
and DGCA should be ensured to eliminate
communication gaps resulting into the safety
hazards.
18. Pre-flight briefing of passengers, particularly
those seated near location of exit, should be
enforced and it should be assured that only

-104-
those passengers who can operate the emergency
exit,
should be allowed to sit near
(cid:9)
those
exits.
19.
The record keeping of major components by IA
should 12e computerised since it needs improvement
in view of many discrepancies and repetitive snags
noted.
20.
The existing system of no reservation, no waiting
list for SOL passengers should be suitably
changed.
21.
Work culture should be introduced in all the
Organisations.
22.
The Command endorsement given to Capt. S.N. Singh
should be cancelled.
23.
co-pilot endorsement of Capt. S.N. Singh should be
suspended for a period of three years.
24.(cid:9)
Suitable departmental actions against all those
who have failed in their duties should be
initiated.

-105-
25. Mr. Gosavi, Senior Fire Foreman who, even
without waiting for any instructions from higher
up or for siren, promptly moved with CFT in the
direction of the aircraft, should be suitably
rewarded.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
All that remains is to acknowledge(cid:9) the
guidance/help that I have received in conducting this
formal investigation and in making this Report.
For a non-technical person like me this task -
involving highly technical aspects - would have been
impossible without the able guidance of Assessors Mr.
S.N. Gupta and Capt. V.V. Mahesh - both stalwarts in
their respective fields. I was immensely benefitted by
their knowledge and experience. I am grateful to them.
Mr. L.A. Mahalingam, the Secretary to the Court
of Inquiry is a silent and patient Administrator. Whole
brunt of administration was on his shoulders. His frail
personality bore the irksome burden without any sign of
stress or strain. I thank him for all the timely as well
as untimely troubles he has taken.
In Mr. K. Gohain, the Inspector of Accident, I
found not only a very knowledgable person but a person
brimful with devotion to work and sincerity of purpose.
Hats off to his capacity for hard work. His approach to
the investigation was extremely fair. He was a willing
worker and I think I fully exploited him. All thanks to
him for so willingly being allowed to be exploited.
The parties were represented by able lawyers.
They rendered great help in conducting this Inquiry.
Their professional skill and standard was of high quality

-107-
and the cup of co-operation was brimful. I am indebted
to them for excellent legal assistance.
The Ames Research Centre (National Aeronautics &
Space Administration), Moffett Field, Sanfransisco (USA)
is a very busy Organisation burdened with much heavier
national tasks.Yet, as before, it showed no hesitation to
assist the Court in penetrating into human mind and
behaviour in such crisis situations. Dr. Irving C.
Statler, Chief of Aero Space Human Factors Research
Division, helped a lot in making arrangement for the
conferences with the experts on various fields under the
able leadership of Dr. Key Dismukes, the Chief Scientist.
No words would be sufficient to express my gratitude to
them and other experts like Dr. Barbara G. Kanki,
Research Psychologist Crew Factors Group, Mr. Linda J.
Connell, Research Psychologist for presenting various
possible
human behavioural angles involved and rendering
to us all the help and courtesies.
Boeing Co.,
Seattle rendered great help in this
Inquiry by providing services of their engineering
Simulator for the type aircraft. Company's able
officials (i) Mr. John W. Purvis, Director, Air Safety
Investigation & Flight Test, (ii) Mr. J. Dennis Rodrigues
from Boeing Safety Investigation, (iii) Mr. James W.
Kerrigan, Principal Engineer,
Stability & Control &
Aerodynamics, (iv) Mr. Peteris A. Galins, Lead Engineer,
Performance Group, and (v) Capt. John H. Armstrong, Chief
Pilot Air Safety, who flew the Simulator time and again,
rendered
help and guidance which proved to be very useful
in the Inquiry. Our programme had to be re
-scheduled
which must have
upset their schedule and caused

-108-
inconvenience to them. They all deserve highest
appreciation. My sincere thanks to them for all the help
and courtesies.
Various sub-groups were formed for different
types of investigations, without which completion of this
Inquiry would not have been possible. I am thankful to
all those who were associated with the different onerous
task of investigation.
IA staff at CTE,Hyderabad headed by
Capt.R.P.Burnwal and assisted by Capt.M.V.V.Rao
)showed to
us the institution and its working. Capt.D'Costa flew
the Simulator severaltimes. I am thankful to them for
all the assistance and courtesy.
IA staff at Delhi & Calcutta workshop respectively
headed by Mr.Jain and Capt.J.R.D.Rao showed to us their
shops with great interest. I am thankful to them.
AVM H.M.Shahul (Member Operations),NAA took lead
in showing NAA's Civil Aviation Training College at
Allahabad. Principal of the college Mr.Raghavendra Rao
and his team explained to us various features of the
training aids, UNDP project, infrastructure, basic Radar,
ATC Radar Control,Computer Hardware,
special equipments
like VOR,DME,etc.used in training.
(cid:9)
I am thankful to
them.
Recording of evidence replete with technical
words and pharases cannot be an easy task for those who
are not familiar with those words and phrases. Evidence
was recorded sometimes on non
-
working days, sometimes by

-109--
cutting short recess and sometimes even after regular
Court hours. My Private Secretary Mr. R.R. Tapadia and
Personal Assistant Mr. P.G. Kulkarni, who did that work
and the work of typing the Report deserve special
mention. Mr. K. Udayakumar, Stenographer, Office of the
Director of Airworthiness, helped them in preparation of
the Report. Mr. J.S. Chorge and Mr. K.M. More, Section
Officers and other members of the staff worked hard. I
record my sincere appreciation for all of them for
putting such hard work and giving excellent co-operation
without which completion of this difficult task within
short time of 31
1 months from the day of starting of
recording oral evidence, would have been impossible.
Mr. H.S. Khola, DGCA is a well known figure. I
had occasion to meet him in the course of this
investigation. Hardly one comes across such a balanced
and knowledgable personality. I cannot complete this
exercise without recording the above indelible
impression.
