Synopsis:-
On 15.06.2023 M/s InterGlobe Aviation Ltd. (IndiGo) Airbus A321-252NX(neo)
aircraft VT-IMW, operated a scheduled passenger flight 6E-6595 from Bengaluru to
Ahmedabad. The PIC was the Pilot Flying and the First Officer was the Pilot Monitoring for the
subject flight sector.
The Secondary flight plan was activated during the descent phase and FMS was prepared with
landing configuration as CONF FULL. However CONF 3 was selected during approach. An
ILS approach was carried out for RWY 23 at Ahmedabad. PIC made a decision to perform a
‘Practice Autoland’ during the final approach. The First officer was not qualified for CAT II/III
operations. ATC informed the existing wind conditions to the crew, which were beyond the
Autoland limitations for the aircraft. However, an Autoland was carried out. In accordance with
the CONF FULL configured in FMS, the VAPP computed by FMS resulted in target speed
lower than VLS which then contributed to a touch down below VLS-15kt. The aircraft touched
down with pitch attitude of 10° which exceeded the geometric limitation w.r.t ground clearance
and the tail fuselage section made ground contact.
DGCA-India, vide Order No DGCA-15019(01)/02/2023-DAS dated 21.06.2023 instituted
investigation of the incident under Rule 13 (1) of Aircraft (Investigation of Accidents and
Incidents), Rules 2017 by appointing an Investigation-In-Charge along with a member to
associate in the investigation.
The probable cause of the incident was the aircraft speed reduction to the extent of VLS-15kt,
the low energy state of the aircraft resulted in an increase of pitch beyond limits during the
autoland and the ensuing contact of the aircraft tail section with ground during touchdown.
The following factors led to the incident:-
 Non-adherence to SOP (Standard Operating Procedures) during FMS configuration and
during activation of the Secondary Flight Plan, i.e., FMS active and secondary FLPNs
mishandling.
 Flaps CONF 3 selection made during approach against a planned approach with
CONFIG FULL in the FMS performance page, leading to a lower target speed
computation.
 PIC’s non-compliance with the SOP for an Auto Land, including wind limitations and
flight crew qualifications.
 Lack of effective CRM between the operating crew members.

1. Factual Information
1.1History of flight:
M/s InterGlobe Aviation Ltd. (IndiGo) Airbus A321-252NX(neo) aircraft VT-IMW operated a
scheduled passenger flight no. 6E-6595 from Bengaluru to Ahmedabad on 15.06.2023.
The subject flight sector was the first sector operated by the crew on 15.06.2023. The PIC was
the Pilot Flying and the First Officer was the Pilot Monitoring for the sector from Bengaluru to
Ahmedabad. The crew members who operated the flight underwent a Breath-analyser test for
alcohol consumption at Bengaluru prior to departure to Ahmedabad and the test result was
‘Negative’. Transit inspection of the aircraft was performed by AME before the flight from
Bengaluru - Ahmedabad (6E-6595) on 15.06.2023.
There were a total of 215 passengers and 07 crew members on-board the aircraft at the time of
the incident. The aircraft's chocks OFF time from Bengaluru was 06:35 UTC and it got airborne
at 06:50 UTC.
The take-off from Bengaluru was performed by the PIC & the flight from take-off till top of
descent was uneventful. During descent the PIC, who was the PF carried out briefing for the
planned arrival to Ahmedabad via APANO 1A arrival ILS approach RWY 23 based on ATC
clearance. A Flap 3/CONF 3 approach was decided after discussion among the cockpit crew
which also included the Go-around plan. The briefing was carried out for an ILS Z approach
RWY23 with CONF 3. The aircraft was configured for the planned configuration of CONF 3
and was stabilised for the approach. Runway in use at the time of approach was ILS RWY23.
During the approach the crew observed weather approaching from the North West and they
informed the ATC of the approaching weather. During approach strong winds of the order of
30-35 kt were experienced during final turn and approach. On finals ATC reported wind gusts
up to 20 to 25 kt. PIC reported that visibility was good but approach was ‘bumpy’ due winds;
as the aircraft was Auto land current he decided to carry out auto land. During the ILS approach
the PIC informed TWR that they were carrying out a ‘Practice AUTOLAND’. Decision to
perform an Autoland was made by the PF(PIC)during the final approach segment.
After flare-out, the landing was perceived as ‘hard’ by the crew. Auto pilot was disconnected
post landing during landing roll. On reaching bay and switching off Engines, AME observed the
tail strike and informed the crew.

twenty five (25) hours of cockpit communications. Relative time mentioned is w.r.t the subject
sector. The recorded data was downloaded and following salient observations are made:-
1. The PIC informed the First Officer before top of descent (relative time 01:22) that he is
configuring the FMS for arrival on secondary flight plan and not in primary and First Officer
replied ‘right’.
2. Crew carried out arrival briefing for Ahmedabad based on available information including
the actions in case of a go-around. During the discussion the PIC informed he is planning a
CONF 3 landing and First officer replied that runway is long.
3. Crew discussed that V was 146kt and that IDLE reverse were to be used for landing.
app
4. After coming in contact with Ahmedabad the crew changed over to Ahmedabad, however
crew were unable to contact Ahmedabad again when released by Mumbai (approx. 34
minutes to touchdown). The First Officer again requested Mumbai for Ahmedabad
frequency and PIC took over the communications. Then PIC was able to contact
Ahmedabad on frequency given by Mumbai.
5. Once in contact with Ahmedabad control the aircraft was cleared via APANO 1A arrival
RWY23 and to expect radar vector ILS approach RWY 23.
6. Crew carried out approach checklist at this time QNH was discussed as 1002 hPa and
Minimum was discussed as 430ft.
7. A few seconds later the QNH was reported by ATC as 1001 hPa and PIC discussed as to
QNH is dropping.
8. The PIC is observed to be concerned about the weather and kept informing the First Officer
about the weather at Ahmedabad.
Investigation report: VT-IMW 15.06.2023 Page 10

9. At relative time 01:58:17 the aircraft was advised to contact Ahmedabad tower at 10 miles
from touchdown.
10. The aircraft then contacted tower at about nine miles to touchdown and Ahmedabad tower
informed IFLY6595 that the Winds were 190° 26 kt gusting upto 29kt.
11. PIC enquired with the First Officer what wind information was given by the ATC. First
Officer reply is blocked and the available information is that winds were 15 gusting.
12. Landing gear was extended between 01:58:54 and 01:58:58 relative time.
13. At relative time 01:59:50, the ATC Tower cleared IFLY6595 for landing on RWY23. The
tower reported winds at this time were 190° 20kt gusting up to 25kts.
14. Flaps 3 were selected at relative time 01:59:58 and landing checklist was announced by
First Officer followed by ‘ECAM memo’, PIC announced ‘Landing no blue’. Landing
checklist was completed.
The PIC is observed to be again discussing approaching weather with the First Officer and
informed the Tower controller to expedite landing of other aircraft as weather was
approaching and likely to hit the area soon.
15. At relative time 02:00:50 the PIC informed the First Officer that he is thinking of putting
‘No DH’, which would be the safest thing to do.
16. After the 1000ft autocall, the First Officer queried with the PIC regarding Configuration for
landing at relative time 02:00:50. The PIC immediately replied that it is CONF 3 and it is
the best for a go-around.
17. At 02:01:10 relative time PIC informed the First Officer to call 430 ‘minimum’, so that PIC
will disconnect the AutoPilot.
18. The PIC made a call to the ATC-Tower that ‘Carrying out practice Auto land’ at relative
time 02:01:25. The controller acknowledged the call and advised the crew that sensitive
areas are not protected.
19. ‘400’ autocall is recorded at 02:01:33 relative time.
20. PIC announced ‘Land green’ at 02:01:48 relative time and advised First Officer for ‘Low
brake’ as they are doing an autoland they have to select low brakes also.
21. The sound of ground contact is heard at 02:02:27 relative time following which the PIC
announced Reversers and advised the First Officer to announce further checklist items.
22. During taxi at relative time 02:04:34 the PIC discussed with the First Officer that the winds
were really gusty and that the aircraft was shaking even with automation. He added that
imagine in such scenario hand flying is not easy and that the best thing to do is use
automation.

1.17.1.5 Operations Manual- Part A
1.17.1.5.1 Automatic landing
● Automatic landing is a portion of the LVO approach. An automatic landing system is only
equipment providing automatic control of the aircraft during the approach & landing and is
not related to a particular weather condition. This system is mandatory for all CAT III
operations. However, it can also be performed for a CAT II approach provided the ILS
performance is sufficient and ILS signals are protected. For training and qualification
purposes it is permissible to use Autoland at or above CAT I conditions, subject to various
limitations. In case of failures while performing an Autoland, at any time during the
Investigation report: VT-IMW 15.06.2023 Page 18

approach, if visual references are sufficient, the Auto Pilot can be disengaged and the
landing completed manually.
● In order to keep the aircraft’s Autoland status valid approved pilots are expected to do an
Autoland every 30 days to authorised runways. An entry “Autoland Satisfactory” is to be
made in the FRB whenever a satisfactory Autoland is performed. If the Autoland was not
satisfactory an “Autoland Unsatisfactory” FRB entry is to be made. In addition, PIC is to
make detailed entry (reason) in defect report column of FRB for assisting trouble shooting
by engineers. Auto Land for practise can only be performed at approved runways.
● If no practice/ actual LVO approach and auto land has been carried out in preceding 30 days
the aircraft’s Autoland status gets downgraded. This condition will be indicated to the crew
by a Sticker stating AUTOLAND DOWNGRADED. This will indicate to the crew that
although the aircraft is LVO and Autoland capable yet an actual approach with Autoland
below CAT I minimums is not authorised. To restore its Autoland capability a satisfactory
practice Autoland must be performed at the earliest and an entry made in the FRB stating
“Autoland satisfactory”.
● If the Autoland status has expired/downgraded, crew must perform a practice auto land
only when the ADD/CDD/notices to crew section advises ‘crew to carry out practice auto
land’ and a ’AUTOLAND DOWNGRADED’ placard is placed in the aircraft.
The airline has informed that they had a practice in which whenever a ‘Practice Auto land’
is required for the purpose of keeping aircraft’s Auto land status, MCC was sharing the
Autoland status mail with OCC and Dispatch on daily basis and OCC was further sending
ACARS to crew using automated process. Also it has been informed that, no message was
sent from OCC to the flight crew on 04.06.2023 and 15.06.2023 for performing a ‘Practice
Auto land’.
1.17.1.5.2 Automatic landing in CAT I or better weather conditions
The automatic landing system's performance has been demonstrated on runways equipped with
CAT II or CAT III ILS approaches. However, practice automatic landing in CAT I or better
weather condition is permissible on approved runways with CAT I ground installations or on
CAT II/III ground installations when ILS sensitive areas are not protected, if the following
precautions are taken:
● The Company has checked that the ILS beam quality and the effect of terrain profile before
the runway have no adverse effect on AP/FD guidance. In particular, the effect of terrain
discontinuities within 300 meters before the runway threshold have been evaluated.
● There is no certification requirement to prove that the automatic landing system will
perform as expected at all conceivable airports. The aircraft use FLARE modes for
automatic landing. The FLARE mode is initiated at a given radio altitude (RA), which can
be either advanced or delayed as a function of V/S. A higher V/S in the last part of the
approach due to terrain profile before the runway threshold or higher descent glide slope
angle will cause the flare mode to engage earlier than usual. The aircraft may temporarily
float above the runway surface before pitch is reduced to resume a gentle descent down the
runway leading to a long flare.
Investigation report: VT-IMW 15.06.2023 Page 19

1.17.1.5.3 Practice approaches
All practice approaches on aircraft are to be carried out under weather conditions at or above
CAT I minimums. The practice approaches can be carried out by the Flight Crew who are
qualified and may not be current.
Practice Auto Approaches, at or above CAT I minimum, can be carried out on any ILS equipped
runway.
With weather conditions being better than CAT I minima, the LVPs may not have been
implemented. Therefore, the Critical and Sensitive areas would not be protected and may result
in interference to the ILS signal. The flight crew must continuously monitor the indications.
Further, practice Auto Approach Auto Land for A320/321 can only be carried out on the
runways mentioned in an Annexure to Operations Manual Part A (which includes Ahmedabad-
VAAH RWY23), in-addition to all runways with CAT II/ III facility/ approaches.
1.17.1.6 IndiGo- Operations Notice (Airbus)- FLT/OPS/N-NO:32 Fuel Efficiency & Reducing
Carbon Footprint (RELEVANT EXTRACT)
Background: Adequate fuel is essential, and correct fuel vital. Pilots play a significant role in
fuel management, and hence it is imperative that aircraft are operated in a manner, which is cost
efficient without compromising safety. Conservation begins from the finalisation of fuel figures,
all the way to shut down, a principle not always followed.
It is also stated that, ‘considering the increasing size of operations, an attempt to control rising
carbon emissions & also operating costs by saving every kilogram (KG) of fuel ……..’
Investigation report: VT-IMW 15.06.2023 Page 20

Techniques to reduce Fuel burn & Carbon emissions:
 FLAP 3 LANDINGS:
Flap3 landing is a worldwide regular practice on the A-320. Apart from landing in gusty wind
conditions, it is also executed as a fuel saving measure, when landing performance permits.
IndiGo recommends Flap 3 Landings whenever professional assessment and judgement
determines that they are appropriate for execution. Also, landing performance permitting, Flap3
Configuration is the preferred landing configuration every time. Going forward it is informed
that during PIC RCs the ability of the U/T PIC to execute Flap3 approach and Landing shall be
observed in all RCs.
Full Flap Landings are recommended in the following cases:
 Landings at Performance Limited Airfields.
 Tailwind Component 10k or higher (due high ROD)
 Landing Performance limited
[Refer Annexure 3 for Common Misconceptions and Errors related to Config 3 Landings.]
After the incident the Operations Notice (Airbus)- FLT/OPS/N-NO:32 has been replaced with
Operations Notice(Airbus) FLT/OPS/N-NO: 02-06C on SAFETY, SUSTAINABILITY &
OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY. The relevant extract on landing with Flaps 3 is as below:
CONF-3 LANDINGS: Pilots shall use their assessment and judgement to determine the
appropriate Landing Configuration. CONF-3 should be considered depending on the available
runway length and go-around performance, or in case of windshear/severe turbulence during
approach. While CONF-Full provides better handling capability in turbulent conditions, CONF-
3 provides more energy and less drag. Pilots shall also refer to conditions outlined in FCOM,
FCTM & OMB Chapter 2.
1.18. Additional information:
1.18.1Airbus Report:-
The FDR of the incident flight was evaluated by Airbus and the following were reported:-
The auto-land approach has been initiated with significant wind conditions:
- Longitudinal wind variations from -30kts (headwind) and 0kts
- Left lateral wind variations from +23kts and +10kts
Touch down occurred with landing CONF 3 selected.
Analysis of the FMS BITE indicated that a copy of the active FPLN to secondary FPLN has
been done at 07:58:36 UTC with landing configuration as default, meaning CONF FULL.
Then, indeed CONF 3 has been selected in the active FPLN by the crew during cruise (MCDU
5R button recorded pushed) around 08:00:41 UTC, before the top of descent (T/D).
At 08:07:12 UTC, secondary FPLN was activated during the descent. This led the landing
configuration to revert to CONF FULL as copied previously.
In accordance with the CONF FULL considered by the FMS, the Vapp computation resulted to
be lower than VLS which then contributed to a touch down below VLS-15.
Investigation report: VT-IMW 15.06.2023 Page 21

Airbus concluded that as per the above analysis, the reported issue was due to FMS active and
secondary FLPNs mishandling and wind gusts during final approach and flare.
No aircraft misbehaviour has been observed on this event.
The PITCH WARNING is available with the below conditions:-
PITCH WARNING PIN-Prog active ; Radio-Altimeter < 20Ft; TOGA mode not active;
Autopilots OFF; Pitch + pitch rate > 8.25°.
As per DFDR data the during flare phase Pitch angle reached +10.02° with both AP’s engaged.
As per the above mentioned PITCH WARNING conditions, AP’s must be OFF to active the
PITCH PITCH warning. This was the reason for non-activation of PITCH PITCH warning
during the event.

After landing at Ahmedabad the following entry was made in the technical log book:
‘SECTOR SNAG NIL . NOTE: CARRIED OUT AUTOLAND IN CONF3 AS WINDS WERE
GUSTING 190/20-25kt AFTER FLARE OUT AC DID HARD LANDING.’
Investigation report: VT-IMW 15.06.2023 Page 25

1.18.7 FCOM Reference: Limitations: MAXIMUM WIND CONDITIONS FOR ILS/MLS
CAT II OR CAT III AND FOR GLS CAT I : VT-IMW (Relevant Extract)
Headwind : 15 kt
Tailwind : 10 kt
Crosswind : 10 kt
Wind limitation is based on the surface wind reported by ATC. If the wind displayed on
the ND exceeds the above-noted autoland limitations, but the tower reports surface wind within
the limitations, then the autopilot can remain engaged. If the tower reports a surface wind that
exceeds the limitations, only CAT I automatic approach without autoland can be performed.
LIM-AFS-20-10-00020149.0001001: ILS/MLS CAT II and CAT III autoland and GLS CAT I
autoland are approved in CONF 3 and CONF FULL.
LIM-AFS-20-10-00020158.0001001: Automatic landing system performance is demonstrated
with CAT II or CAT III ILS/MLS airport installation. However, automatic landing in CAT I or
better weather conditions is possible on CAT I ground installations or on CAT II/III ground
installations when ILS/MLS sensitive areas are not protected, if the following precautions are
taken:
‐ The airline checked that the ILS/MLS beam quality, and the effect of the terrain profile before
the runway have no adverse effect on AP/FD guidance. Particularly, the effect of terrain profile
within 300 m before the runway threshold must be evaluated.
‐ The flight crew is aware that LOC or G/S beam fluctuations, independent of the aircraft
system, may occur. The PF is prepared to immediately disconnect the autopilot, and to take the
appropriate action, should not satisfactory guidance occur.
‐ At least CAT2 capability is displayed on the FMA and the flight crew uses CAT II/III
procedures.
‐ Visual references are obtained at an altitude appropriate for the CAT I approach. If not, a go-
around must be performed.
1.18.8 FCTM REFERENCE: APPROACH USING LOC G/S FOR CATII CATIII
FLIGHT PREPARATION
In addition to the normal flight preparation, the following preparation must be performed when
CAT II or CAT III approach is planned:
‐ Ensure that destination airport meets CAT II or CAT III requirements
‐ Check aircraft required equipment for CAT 2 or CAT 3 in QRH
‐ Check that crew qualification is current
‐ Consider extra fuel for possible approach delay
‐ Consider weather at alternate
APPROACH PREPARATION
LIMITATIONS
‐ The crew will check that tower wind remains within the limit for CAT II or CAT III approaches
‐ The autoland maximum altitude must be observed.
Investigation report: VT-IMW 15.06.2023 Page 26

AIRPORT FACILITIES
The airport authorities are responsible for establishing and maintaining the equipment required
for CAT II/III approach and landing. The airport authorities will activate the LVP procedures as
the need arises based on RVR. Prior to planning a CAT II/III approach, the crew must ensure
that LVP are in force.
CREW QUALIFICATION
The captain must ensure that both crew members are qualified and that their qualification is
current for the planned approach.
APPROACH BRIEFING
Before commencing a CAT II/III approach a number of factors must be considered by the crew.
In addition to the standard approach briefing, the following points should be emphasised during
an approach briefing for a low visibility approach:
‐ Aircraft capability
‐ Airport facilities
‐ Crew qualification
‐ Weather minima
‐ Task sharing
‐ Call-outs
‐ Go-around strategy
APPROACH PROCEDURE
TASK SHARING
The workload is distributed in such a way that the PF primary tasks are supervising and decision
making and the PM primary task is monitoring the operation of the automatic system.
PF Tasks
The PF supervises the approach (trajectory, attitude, speed) and takes appropriate decision at
DH or in case of failure.
Since the approach is flown with AP / FD / A/THR, the PF must be continuously ready to take-
over:
‐ If any AP hard over is experienced
‐ If a major failure occurs
‐ If any doubt arises.
The PF announces "LAND", when displayed on FMA.
PM Tasks
For aircraft without HUD or with single HUD, the PM is head down throughout the automatic
approach and automatic landing.
For aircraft with DUAL HUD, the PM may be head up or head down.
The PM monitors:
‐ The FMA and calls all mode changes below 350 ft as required (i.e. after PF calls "LAND")
‐ The Auto call out
‐ The aircraft trajectory or attitude exceedance
Investigation report: VT-IMW 15.06.2023 Page 27

‐ Any failures.
The PM should be go-around minded.
FLARE/LANDING/ROLL OUT
During the flare, decrab and roll-out, the PF will look outside to assess that the autoland is
properly carried out, considering the appropriate visual references.
For CAT II approaches, autoland is recommended. If manual landing is preferred, the PF will
take-over at 80 ft at the latest. This ensures a smooth transition for the manual landing.
Pull to REV MAX (or REV IDLE if conditions permits) at main landing gear touchdown (not
before).
The use of auto-brake is recommended as it ensures a symmetrical brake pressure application.
However, the flight crew should be aware of possible dissymmetry in case of crosswind and wet
runways.
The PM should make the standard callouts and advise ATC when the landing roll is completed.
1.18.9 FCTM REFERENCE: AUTOLAND IN CAT I OR BETTER WEATHER
CONDITIONS
The flight crew may wish to practice automatic landings in CAT I or better weather conditions
for training purposes. This type of approach should be carried out only with the airline
authorization. The flight crew should be aware that fluctuations of the LOC and/or GS might
occur due to the fact that protection of ILS sensitive areas, which applies during LVP, will not
necessarily be in force. It is essential; therefore, that the PF is prepared to take over manually at
any time during a practice approach and rollout, should the performance of the AP become
unsatisfactory.
1.18.10 FCOM REFERENCE: MANAGED SPEED/MACH TARGET
For managed speed/Mach, the lowest target is VLS, and the highest target is:
‐ VMAX in the case VMAX is equal to VFE, or
‐ VMAX - 5 kt in the case VMAX is equal to VMO/MMO.
When speed/Mach is managed, the target is defined as follows:
AP/FD Engaged Mode
Managed Speed/Mach Target
or FMS Flight Phase
VAPP, corrected by the Ground Speed Mini
function.
‐ The FMS flight phase is the approach
phase
Before reaching the landing configuration, the
speed will not go below:
In this case, the APs and/or FDs may be
‐ Green Dot, in clean configuration
on or off
‐ S, in CONF 1
‐ F, in CONF 2
Or
‐ F, in CONF 3, when CONF FULL is the landing
configuration (as defined in the PERF APPR page).
‐ F-G/S, G/S, LAND, FLARE or ROLL
OUT is engaged
Investigation report: VT-IMW 15.06.2023 Page 28

VAPP is memorized at 700 ft RA, so if the FMS
loses the VAPP below 700 ft RA, the managed
speed target will still be computed.
The lower limit of the managed speed target is the
VAPP that is computed by the FMS, and displayed
on the MCDU.
If the VAPP computed by the FMS is not available,
the VAPP is VLS +5 kt.
The higher limit of the managed speed target is the
VFE NEXT (or VFE - 5 kt in full configuration) of
the landing configuration.
1.18.11FCOM REFERENCE: GROUND SPEED MINI FUNCTION
When the aircraft flies an approach in managed speed, the managed speed target, displayed by
the magenta triangle on the PFDs, is variable. This managed speed target is the VAPP, displayed
on the PERF APPR page, corrected by the Ground Speed Mini function.
ACTIVATION CONDITIONS
The Ground Speed Mini function is active when:
‐ The speed is managed
‐ The FMS flight phase is the approach phase.
The Ground Speed Mini function does not correct Green Dot, S and F speeds.
PRINCIPLE
The Ground Speed Mini function takes advantage of the aircraft inertia when the wind varies
during the approach in order to provide an appropriate indicated target speed (i.e. the managed
target speed represented by the magenta triangle on the PFD). When the flight crew flies this
indicated target speed, the energy of the aircraft is maintained above a minimum level that
ensures standard aerodynamic margins versus the stall.
The minimum energy level is the energy level the aircraft will have at touchdown with an
indicated airspeed equal to VAPP, and with the wind equal to the tower reported wind as inserted
in the PERF APPR page. The ground speed then equals the Ground Speed Mini.
The Ground Speed Mini is not displayed to the flight crew.
During the approach, the FMGS continuously computes the managed target speed in order to
keep the ground speed at or above the Ground Speed Mini.
MANAGED SPEED TARGET COMPUTATION
The computation of the managed speed target uses the tower headwind component, the current
headwind component, and the VAPP.
TOWER HEADWIND COMPONENT
The tower wind is the average wind provided by the ATIS or the tower. The flight crew enters
the tower wind in the MAG WIND field in the PERF APPR page.
The tower headwind component is the projection of the MAG WIND on the runway axis. This
computation is based on the runway inserted in the FMS active F-PLN.
Investigation report: VT-IMW 15.06.2023 Page 29

CURRENT HEADWIND COMPONENT
The projection of the current wind measured by the ADIRS on the aircraft longitudinal axis is
the current headwind component (instantaneous headwind).
VAPP COMPUTATION
The FMS computes the VAPP, and displays it on the PERF APPR page. The VAPP computation
takes into account the tower headwind component. VAPP is the highest of the following
computations:
‐ VAPP = VLS + 1/3 x TWR HEADWIND COMPONENT, or
‐ VAPP = VLS + 5 kt.
Note: “1/3 of the TWR HEADWIND COMPONENT” has 2 limits:
‐ 0 kt as the minimum value (no wind or tailwind)
‐ +15 kt as the maximum value.
The flight crew can manually modify the VAPP and the MAG WIND values on the PERF APPR
page.
MANAGED SPEED TARGET COMPUTATION
The FG continuously computes the managed speed target that is equal to VAPP plus an
additional increment. This increment takes into account the headwind variation during the final
approach.
Managed speed target = VAPP + 1/3 x (CURRENT HEADWIND COMPONENT – TWR
HEADWIND COMPONENT).
The managed speed target has the following limits:
‐ VAPP, as the minimum value
‐ VFE next, in CONF 0, 1, 2, 3, VFE - 5 kt in CONF FULL, as the maximum value.
1.18.12 FCOM REFERENCE: Characteristic speeds discussed in the report
Air Speed Scale
The characteristic speeds displayed on the PFD are computed by the Flight Augmentation
Computer (FAC), according to the FMS weight data (for PFD/MCDU display consistency and
accuracy purposes).
Investigation report: VT-IMW 15.06.2023 Page 30

VLS (of normal landing configuration: CONF 3 or FULL), F, S and Green Dot speeds are also
displayed on the MCDU TAKEOFF and/or APPR pages. VLS is indicated by the top of the
amber strip along the speed scale indicates this speed. It represents the lowest selectable speed
providing an appropriate margin to the stall speed.
Vapp is the Final approach speed. It is Calculated by the FMGCs and displayed on MCDU
APPR page. VAPP = VLS + wind correction. The wind correction is limited to a minimum of 5
kt and a maximum of 15 kt. The flight crew may modify VAPP through the MCDU. During
autoland or when A/THR is on or in case of ice accretion or gusty crosswind greater than 20 kt,
VAPP must not be lower than VLS +5 kt.
The target airspeed is either computed by the FMGC in managed speed mode (magenta triangle)
or manually entered on the FCU in selected speed mode (blue triangle).The target speed is a
magenta double bar (=) when associated with the ECON speed range.
1.18.13 Additional inputs from crew account of the incident
PIC reported that visibility was good but approach was ‘bumpy’ due winds; as the aircraft Auto
land status was current, he decided to carry out auto land as he felt that there is higher safety in
doing so.
The First Officer reported that he had practised Auto Land during his type rating training in-
case of PIC In-capacitation, though he was not CAT II/III qualified. There was no “PITCH
PITCH “ alert generated during flare.
The PIC who was the PF prepared the FMS for arrival by making a copy of the active flight plan
to secondary and announced that arrival is prepared in secondary, which was also acknowledged
by the First Officer during descent preparation (CVR). However, the First Officer informed
during discussion that he was not aware of the same.
1.19 Useful or effective investigation techniques:-
Nil.
Investigation report: VT-IMW 15.06.2023 Page 31

2. Analysis:-
2.1 Serviceability of the aircraft:-
Airbus A321-252NX(neo) aircraft VT-IMW of IndiGo was issued a Certificate of Registration
on 01.11.2022 by DGCA-INDIA (entered in the register of India with effect from 28.10.2022)
and its last ARC is valid till 03.11.2023. The aircraft (MSN-10882) was manufactured in 2022.
The aircraft had accumulated a total of 2389:48hrs since new.
Transit inspection of the aircraft was performed by AME before the flight from Bengaluru -
Ahmedabad (6E-6595) on 15.06.2023. No relevant MEL was active on VT-IMW as on the date
of incident.
Based on the approved Operations Manual -Part A of M/s InterGlobe Aviation Ltd. a Practice
Autoland is conducted to keep the aircraft’s Autoland status valid, wherein qualified pilots are
required perform an Autoland every 30 days to authorised runways followed by an entry in the
FRB i.e. whether the “Autoland” was satisfactory or not, for the purpose keeping aircraft
“Autoland” status valid.
The airline has informed that they had a practice in which whenever a ‘Practice Auto land’ is
required for the purpose of keeping aircraft’s Auto land status, MCC was sharing the Autoland
status mail with OCC and Dispatch on daily basis and OCC was further sending ACARS to crew
using automated process. However no documented procedure could be produced by M/s
InterGlobe Aviation Ltd. in this regard.
It has been informed by M/s IndiGo that, no message was sent from OCC to the flight crew for
performing a ‘Practice Auto land’ for the subject flight on 15.06.2023. It has also been informed
that the practice of sending ACARS messages to flight crew for carrying out practice auto land
has been discontinued post subject incident, as the landing capability can be tested on ground
itself.
The last practice Autoland for VT-IMW prior to the incident was carried out on 04.06.2023 and
Autoland Satisfactory entry was made in the FRB/ Technical log, there was no message sent
from OCC to the flight crew on 04.06.2023 for performing a ‘Practice Auto land’.
“Pitch Pitch” autocall was not generated during flare as AutoPilot 1 & 2 were engaged during
landing.
The major and all lower inspections were carried out as and when due. The left Engine S/N
59B109 had logged 2389:48Hrs / 1590 Cycles and the right Engine S/N 59B112 had logged
2389:48Hrs / 1590 ECYC. There was no defect reported prior to departure for the subject flight
sector.
Prior to the incident flight, the weight and balance of the aircraft was well within the operating
limits.
The serviceability of the aircraft was not a factor which contributed to the incident.
Investigation report: VT-IMW 15.06.2023 Page 32

2.2 Weather aspect:
The weather forecasts provided to the crew were valid for the arrival time at Ahmedabad. TAF
for Ahmedabad (VAAH) included in the flight folder indicated that forecasted winds were from
190 degree and 18kt with gusts up to 28kt were expected. Hence, the forecast clearly indicated
the possibility of significant wind and gusty conditions at the time of arrival at Ahmedabad.
The Maximum Wind Conditions for an autoland as defined in FCOM by Airbus for VT-IMW
is Headwind: 15kt; Tailwind: 10kt and Crosswind: 10kt
The FCOM further states that, Wind limitation is based on the surface wind reported by ATC.
If the wind displayed on the ND exceeds the above-noted autoland limitations, but the tower
reports surface wind within the limitations, then the autopilot can remain engaged. If the tower
reports a surface wind that exceeds the limitations, only CAT I automatic approach without
autoland can be performed.
The PIC continued the approach with intention of an autoland, though the approach was being
performed with ATC reported winds in excess of the FCOM limitations for an autoland.
Airbus analysis also points that, the auto-land approach has been initiated with significant wind
conditions:
- Longitudinal wind variations from -30kts (headwind) and 0kts
- Left lateral wind variations from +23kts and +10kts
Weather was a contributory factor in the incident.
2.3 Flight Crew Training and Qualifications:
Practice automatic landing in CAT I or better weather condition is permissible on approved
runways with CAT I ground installations or on CAT II/III ground installations when ILS
sensitive areas are not protected. The practice autoland can only be carried out by the Flight
Crew who are qualified for Cat II/ III operations.
Crew after training and checks on simulator followed by one approach on aircraft are qualified
for CAT II/III operations. The PIC was appropriately trained and qualified for CAT II/III
operations in which an autoland is carried out. The same was also included in the last training
on simulator in March 2023, which also complied with the recency requirement.
PIC Incapacitation and autoland topics were included in ‘ZFTT Simulator Training’ during
Initial type rating course of First Officer in January 2020. However he was not trained and
qualified for CAT II/ III operations.
Ahmedabad ILS RWY 23 has been approved by M/s InterGlobe Aviation Ltd. for Practice Auto
Land and the information is detailed in the approved Operations Manual of M/s InterGlobe
Aviation Ltd.
To exercise the privileges of applicable CAT II/III authorization, a PIC/ Co-pilot shall have
carried out a minimum of 6 CAT II/III approaches to the authorised RVR including 3 landings
in the approved simulator. Hence, there is no recency requirement for qualified crew to perform
Investigation report: VT-IMW 15.06.2023 Page 33

a practice autoland on aircraft. From the above it can be seen that practice autoland has to be
conducted for the purpose of maintaining aircraft “Autoland” status as valid or for initial crew
qualification and not for crew recency requirements, however there is also no restriction on the
operating crew from M/s InterGlobe Aviation Ltd. on performing “Autoland”, if used within
aircraft limitations.
The PIC was appropriately trained and qualified for CAT II/III operations whereas the First
Officer was not trained and qualified for CAT II/ III operations.
SOP For CAT II/ III Auto Land
M/s IndiGo has a “Ready Reckoner” which combines all the company requirements for ready
reference to its crew when a CAT II/III Auto Land is planned to be performed, the same
procedure is followed for a Practice Auto Land in CAT I conditions.
This document outlines the entire process from Pre-requisites to review of failure cases prior to
performing an Autoland, including crew qualifications and wind limitations. Whereas in the
subject incident no review/ discussion/ briefing were conducted by the PIC and he directly
informed the ATC regarding his intention to perform a ‘Practice Autoland’. The First Officer
did not alert the PIC regarding his qualification status for Cat II/III operations.
FCOM reference: Descent preparation - FMS configuration states that: Landing configuration
to be selected on the MCDU-PERF APPR page: CONF FULL in the normal landing
configuration. CONF 3 should be considered, depending on the available runway length and go-
around performance, or if windshear/ severe turbulence is considered possible during approach.
CONF FULL is the default landing configuration (in PERF page) during FMS configuration,
which may be selected as CONF 3 by the crew, when required.
2.3 (a) Company Operations notice on use of Flaps - CONF 3:
Vide Operations Notice (Airbus)- FLT/OPS/N-NO:32 IndiGo recommended use of Flap
3(CONF 3) Landings whenever professional assessment and judgement determines that they are
appropriate for execution. The operations notice also stated that, landing performance
permitting, Flap3 Configuration is the preferred landing configuration every time. In-addition
the document stated that, during PIC Rout Checks the ability of the U/T PIC to execute Flap3
approach and Landing shall be observed in all Route Checks.
Full Flap Landings were recommended in the following cases: Landings at Performance Limited
Airfields, Tailwind Component 10kt or higher (due high ROD) and Landing Performance
limited.
The Operations Notice (Airbus)- FLT/OPS/N-NO:32 has been replaced with Operations
Notice(Airbus) FLT/OPS/N-NO: 02-06C on SAFETY, SUSTAINABILITY &
OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY. The operator has amended its Operations notice and has
informed to the pilots that they shall use their assessment and judgement to determine the
appropriate Landing Configuration. CONF-3 should be considered depending on the available
runway length and go-around performance, or in case of windshear/severe turbulence during
approach. While CONF-Full provides better handling capability in turbulent conditions,
Investigation report: VT-IMW 15.06.2023 Page 34

CONF-3 provides more energy and less drag. Pilots are further advised to also refer to conditions
outlined in FCOM, FCTM & OM-B on the subject.
2.4 Operational handling:
2.4.1 Descent Preparation:
The aircraft reached the cruise level of 36000ft by 07:14 UTC. FMS BITE indicated that a copy
of the active FPLN to secondary FPLN has been done at 07:58:36 UTC with landing
configuration as default (CONF FULL). Then, CONF 3 was selected in the active FPLN by the
crew during cruise around 08:00:41 UTC, before the top of descent (T/D).
The PIC informed the First Officer before top of descent (about 40 minutes before touchdown)
that he was configuring the FMS for arrival on secondary flight plan and not in primary which
was acknowledged by the First Officer. The PIC who was the PF for the sector prepared the
FMS for arrival; he was responsible to appropriately plan the FMS- ARRIVAL, F-PLN A and
PERF page. The PF is also required to enter the QNH, temperature and wind at destination and
minimum.
Based on Airbus procedures:
After the PF prepares the FMS the PM is required to check the data entered made by the PF in
the FMS. So, that PM would have the same mental image of the intended arrival and approach
procedure, trajectory, and constraints than the PF. The PM should check with the PF if anything
is not clear.
As per the available evidences neither did the First Officer crosscheck or raise any concern about
the FMS arrival data nor did he query the PIC about the flight plan or landing performance data.
2.4.2 Secondary Flight Plan:
FCOM guidelines state that, the secondary flight plan is an option available to the crew. Before
the top of descent, the SEC F-PLN should either be set to an alternate runway for destination.
So that, if there is a last-minute runway change, then the flight crew only needs to activate the
secondary F-PLN.
The FCOM procedure also advises to check the VAPP after the activation of the SEC F-PLN,
and modify it, if necessary. Also crew is required to check /modify the landing configuration.
The PF is required to select the landing configuration on the PERF APPR page: CONF FULL
in the normal landing configuration. CONF 3 should be considered, depending on the available
runway length and go-around performance, or if windshear/severe turbulence is considered
possible during approach, the forecasted winds were from 190 degree and 18kt with gusts up to
28kt were expected. When the flight crew plans on landing in FLAPS 3 configuration, the GPWS
LDG FLAP 3 PB-SW is set to ON. Upon completion of this task, ‘Flaps’ in ECAM checklist
will also be indicated as complied (No Blue) as soon as Flaps are in ‘CONF 3’.
2.4.3 FLT PLAN handling:
The PIC who was the PF prepared the FMS for arrival by making a copy of the active flight plan
to secondary and announced it which was also acknowledged by the First Officer during descent
preparation. However, the First Officer informed that he was not aware of the same, the First
Officer did not cross check the FMS data and the acknowledgement was likely not made
Investigation report: VT-IMW 15.06.2023 Page 35

consciously and was made in the flow while the crew were performing descent preparation
without having the mental picture of the approach planned by the PIC.
However the PIC configured the arrival Performance in active flight plan. After 08:01:39 UTC
the aircraft started descent. At 08:07:12 UTC (30 minutes to touchdown) secondary FPLN was
activated during the descent. This led to the reversion of landing configuration to CONF FULL
as copied previously. This activation of the secondary flight plan was not announced by the PIC.
This disconnect between the either crew members is further evident during the unannounced
activation of the secondary flight plan at 08:07:12 UTC (i.e., 30 minutes to touchdown) which
led to the reversion of landing configuration to CONF FULL as copied previously. Initial entries
and changed entries to automated systems were not verbalised and acknowledged.
2.5 Events leading to the incident:
Crew carried out arrival briefing for Ahmedabad, for a CONF 3 landing including the actions in
case of a go-around. After coming in contact with Ahmedabad the crew changed over to
Ahmedabad, however crew was unable to contact Ahmedabad again when released by Mumbai
(approx. 34 minutes to touchdown). The First Officer again requested Mumbai for Ahmedabad
frequency and PIC took over the communications. Then PIC was able to contact Ahmedabad on
frequency given by Mumbai. Once in contact with Ahmedabad control (approx. 30 minutes to
touchdown) the aircraft was cleared via APANO 1A arrival RWY23 and was advised to expect
radar vector ILS approach RWY 23; during this period (08:07:12 UTC, i.e., approx. 30 minutes
to touchdown) secondary FPLN was activated during the descent. This led to the reversion in
landing configuration to CONF FULL as copied previously. At no point was the activation of
the secondary flight plan brought to the attention of the First Officer who was the Pilot
Monitoring.
Crew carried out approach checklist and Minimum discussed was 430ft, QNH received from
ATC was 1002 hPa. A few minutes later the QNH reported by ATC as 1001 hPa and PIC brought
the attention of the First Officer towards the drop in QNH. The PIC was concerned about the
weather and kept discussing with the First Officer about the approaching weather being observed
by them at Ahmedabad during the descent and approach, even at 10Nm to touchdown.
The crew contacted Ahmedabad tower at about nine miles to touchdown and Ahmedabad tower
informed that the Winds were 190° 26kt gusting up to 29kt. PIC rechecked with the First Officer
regarding the wind information transmitted by the ATC. First Officer’s reply is not clearly heard
in CVR but the recorded information is that winds were 15 gusting.
About a minute and half later (approximately 02 minutes to touchdown), the ATC Tower cleared
VT-IMW for landing on RWY23, the tower reported winds at this time were 190° 20kt gusting
up to 25 kt. Flaps 3 was selected and Landing checklist was completed. The PIC is observed to
be again discussing the approaching weather with the First Officer and informed the Tower
controller to expedite landing of other aircraft as weather was approaching and was likely to hit
the area soon.
During the approach just prior to the 1000 ft auto-call (about 01 minutes and 20 seconds to
touchdown), PIC informed the First Officer that he was thinking of putting ‘No DH’, which he
thought was the safest thing to do in the prevailing condition. Soon the First Officer queried
with the PIC regarding configuration used; The PIC interrupted the First Officer, the reply was
Investigation report: VT-IMW 15.06.2023 Page 36

immediate and not receptive towards the opinion/ input, which the First Officer was trying to
communicate, the PIC stated that the configuration used was CONF 3 and it is the best for a go-
around. The First Officer further did not speak up and state his intentions with appropriate
persistence. The PIC promoted the course of action that he felt was the best, even though the
prerequisites for an Practice Auto Land were not followed/ complied.
The PIC then advised the First Officer to remind of ‘minimum’ at ‘430’, so that he would
disconnect the Auto Pilot, following which (at approx. 01 minute and 10 seconds to touchdown)
the PIC then made a call to the ATC that ‘Carrying out practice Auto land’. The controller
acknowledged the call and advised the crew that sensitive areas were not protected. The decision
to perform a ‘Practice Autoland' was not communicated in the cockpit; it was taken
independently by the PIC and not after discussion with the First Officer indicating a lack of
effective CRM and exclusion of the First Officer from the decision making, neither did the First
Officer inform the PIC about his qualification status for Cat II/III operations. The “overall
picture” and the approach plan were not shared with the First Officer.
The system design for managed speed/Mach is such that the lowest target is VLS. However, in
the approach phase, VAPP is memorised at 700 ft RA, so that if the FMS loses the VAPP below
700ft RA, the managed speed target will still be computed. The lower limit of the managed
speed target is the VAPP that is computed by the FMS, and displayed on the MCDU. In the
subject scenario, the VLS was 140kt and the Ground Speed Mini function adjusted target speeds
for the wind conditions during approach. However below 700ft radio altitude, the target speed
was the memorised Vapp which in this case, due to selection of Landing Configuration as
CONFIG FULL was less than VLS (which was calculated for selected configuration of CONF
3). This resulted in the target speed being lower than VLS. The PF and the PM did not monitor
the drop in the target speed and the drop in aircraft speed below the VLS was not announced.
PIC announced ‘Land green’ and advised the First Officer for ‘Low brake’ about 30 seconds
before touchdown. The First Officer did not respond to the actions of the PIC nor did he take
any role in the monitoring and announcing the parameters during the ‘Practice Autoland'.
There was a significant change in winds below 60ft radio altitude from approx. 28kt to 11kt at
touchdown and change in direction from about 175° to about 130°. The aircraft pitch was about
4°-5° during final approach below 500ft radio altitude. Below 50ft radio altitude the aircraft
pitch started increasing from 4.7°. The aircraft pitch increased beyond 5° below 40ft radio
altitude and reached a max of 10° upon touchdown. The speed at touchdown was about 15kt
below VLS. There were no callouts from the PF or the PM regarding the target air speed
fluctuation below the VLS (140kt) during the approach.
Upon touchdown the PIC announced Reversers and advised the First Officer to announce further
checklist items, as the First Officer did not announce any callouts during the final approach to
flare. During TAXI IN at Ahmedabad, the PIC discussed with the First Officer that the winds
were really gusty and that the aircraft was shaking even with automation. He added that in such
scenarios manual flying is not easy and that the best thing to do is use automation, which is
contrary to the limitations and system definition for performing an AUTO Land.

CRM issues identified were associated with poor decision-making, ineffective communication,
and poor task or resource management. FCOM/SOP's defines the shared mental model upon
which a good crew performance depends upon, the established SOP's had been ignored by the
crew.
To summarise the above; due to CONFIG FULL selection made in the performance(PERF) page
during the FMS setup and CONF 3 being selected during approach, the FMS memorised target
speed (Vapp) which was below VLS for CONF 3 was maintained below 700ft during the
approach. The decrease in speed is of the extent of VLS-15 which caused a decrease in aircraft
energy. The low energy state of the aircraft and variations in the prevailing winds resulted in an
increase of pitch and the ensuing tail ground contact during touchdown.

3. Conclusion
3.1 Findings:
1. The aircraft was having a valid Certificate of Airworthiness, Airworthiness Review
Certificate and Certificate of Registration as on the date of incident.
2. The Operating cockpit crew members were having valid licences and ratings for operating
the aircraft.
3. The crew members who operated the flight underwent a Breath-analyser test for alcohol
consumption at Bengaluru prior to departure to Ahmedabad and the test result was
‘Negative’.
4. The aircraft was released in a serviceable condition for the scheduled passenger flight from
Bengaluru on 15.06.2023 for operating 6E-6595(Bengaluru to Ahmedabad). There were no
defects reported prior to the incident sector.
5. The incident sector (Bengaluru-Ahmedabad) was the first flight sector for the subject crew
members on 15.06.2023.
6. PIC was the Pilot Flying and the First Officer was the Pilot Monitoring for the subject flight
sector.
7. Flight Duty Time of both the crew members was within the specified limits.
8. The Pilot Flying (PIC) was adequately trained and qualified for CAT II/ III operations,
while the First Officer was not trained and qualified for Cat II/ Cat III operations.
9. There is no requirement for crew to perform ‘Practice Autoland’ to maintain the recency of
their CAT II/III operations.
10. There were no instructions from M/s IndiGo to the flight crew for the subject flight to
perform a ‘Practice Auto land’.
11. PIC made a copy of the active FPLN to secondary FPLN at 07:58:36 UTC with landing
configuration as default (CONF FULL). Then, CONF 3 was selected in the active FPLN by
the crew during cruise around 08:00:41 UTC, before the top of descent.
12. Before top of descent that PIC configured the FMS for arrival on secondary flight plan,
which was acknowledged by the First Officer.
13. Arrival briefing for Ahmedabad was conducted for a CONF 3 landing including the actions
in case of a go-around.
14. The crew contacted Ahmedabad tower at about nine miles to touchdown and Ahmedabad
tower informed that the Winds were 190° 26kt gusting upto 29kt. PIC rechecked with the
First Officer regarding the wind information transmitted by the ATC. The First Officer did
not alert the PIC about the correct winds.
15. Wind information transmitted by Ahmedabad ATC (Tower) prior to landing was 190° 20kt
gusting up to 25kt. The FCOM limitations w.r.t Maximum Wind Conditions for an autoland
are Headwind: 15kt; Tailwind: 10kt and Crosswind: 10kt. Since the tower reported surface
wind exceeded the limitations, only CAT I automatic approach without Auto land could be
performed.
16. During the issue of landing clearance, ATC informed the crew that the winds were 190°
20kt gusting to 25kt. The operating crew were aware of the prevailing wind conditions and
still chose to continue with the 'Auto land'.
Investigation report: VT-IMW 15.06.2023 Page 39

17. The winds as per FDR indicated that at the time of approach the prevailing wind conditions,
i.e., wind speed was steadily beyond the aircraft limitations for an Auto land.
18. TAF available to the operating crew was 190° 18kt Gust up to 28kt for the period of arrival.
19. Before 1000 ft. the aircraft was configured for landing and was on profile, speed trend was
fluctuating. AP1 remained active from take-off till landing. AP2 was selected at 1896 ft
radio altitude during approach (08:27:32 UTC).
20. Passing 700ft in approach the IAS was 151kt and ground speed was 133 kt. Below 700ft
radio altitude, the Vapp dropped below VLS (140) (the ground speed was about 122-127kt).
This was a result of CONFIG FULL selection made in the performance (PERF APPR) page
during the FMS setup and CONF 3 being selected during approach, the FMS memorised
target speed (Vapp) was below VLS for CONF 3.
21. Decision to do an Auto land was made only during the final approach segment by the PIC
below 700ft radio altitude and First Officer was not consulted during the decision making.
Neither did the First Officer inform the PIC about his qualification status for Cat II/III
operations.
22. Autoland was carried out, but neither was a briefing for Autoland nor was its checklist
followed as per SOP.
23. Passing 60ft radio altitude the aircraft speed was 144kt IAS and 124kt ground speed. There
was a significant change in winds below 60ft radio altitude from approx. 28kt to 11kt at
touchdown and change in direction from about 175° to about 130°.
24. Winds were variable below 1000 feet quartering left headwind varying between 20kt to
35kt.
25. The aircraft geometry is such that aircraft tail would make ground contact when the aircraft
pitch UP angle is near/ more than 9.7 degree UP with Shock Absorber Fully compressed
and near/ more than 11.2 degree UP with Shock Absorber Fully extended.
26. Below 50ft radio altitude the aircraft pitch started increasing from 4.7° and reached a
maximum of 10º at touchdown of main wheels which was at 08:37:26UTC. The aircraft
vertical speed was 128ft/min at touchdown and vertical acceleration of 1.85g. The aircraft
speed, IAS at touchdown was 125kt and ground speed was 124 kt.
27. Aircraft pitch attitude at touchdown was 10° and Tail portion of the fuselage made ground
contact. The speed at touchdown was about 15kt below VLS.
28. ‘Practice Auto land’ is required to be performed every 30 days to authorised runways to
keep the aircraft’s Auto land status valid. The last ‘Practice Autoland’ for VT-IMW prior
to the incident was carried out on 04.06.2023. The aircraft’s autoland status was valid as on
date of the incident.
29. Requirement to perform ‘practice auto land’ for maintaining the aircraft’s Auto land status
‘valid’ has been discontinued post subject incident, as the landing capability is tested on
ground itself.
30. “Pitch Pitch” autocall was not generated during flare as Autopilot was ON during landing.
Investigation report: VT-IMW 15.06.2023 Page 40

3.2 Probable cause:
The probable cause of the incident was the aircraft speed reduction to the extent of VLS-15kt,
the low energy state of the aircraft resulted in an increase of pitch beyond limits during the
autoland and the ensuing contact of the aircraft tail section with ground during touchdown.
The following factors led to the incident: -
 Non-adherence to SOP (Standard Operating Procedures) during FMS configuration and
during activation of the Secondary Flight Plan, i.e., FMS active and secondary FLPNs
mishandling.
 Flaps CONF 3 selection made during approach against a planned approach with
CONFIG FULL in the FMS performance page, leading to a lower target speed
computation.
 PIC’s non-compliance with the SOP for an Auto Land, including wind limitations and
flight crew qualifications.
 Lack of effective CRM between the operating crew members.
4. Safety Recommendations:
1. Necessary corrective training may be imparted to the flight crew in-view of the findings
detailed above.
