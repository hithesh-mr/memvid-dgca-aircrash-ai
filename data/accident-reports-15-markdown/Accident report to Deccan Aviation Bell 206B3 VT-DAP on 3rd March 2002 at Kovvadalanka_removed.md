4. FACTUAL INFORMATION

1.1 History of Flight

AACA

Bell 206 B-3 Helicopter with registration No. VT-DAP was leased from Helicopter

Leasing International Inc., Tokyo, Japan and operated by Deccan Aviation Pvt Ltd.( Non-
scheduled operator Permit No.2/97 issued on 42.9.1997 and valid upto 41.09.2002) with its
Head Office located at Bangalore. The helicopter was hired by Global Peace Initiative, a
voluntary social organization to fly Hon'ble Lok Sabha Speaker Shri G.M.C.Balayogi from
Bhimavaram(West Godavari District) to Hyderabad on 3.3.2002. The helicopter was flown to
Bhimavaram on the previous day and positioned at D.N.R.College ground. Thereon, the
helicopter was flown to S.R.K.Engineering College Helipad at 0700 Hrs(IST) on 3.3.2002 for
the Hon’ble Lok Sabha Speaker. The helicopter took-off from helipad at 0735 Hrs (IST) with
total 3 persons on board including the Pilot, the Hon’ble speaker and his Personal Assistant.

The helicopter was being flown by Capt.G.V.Menon with effect from 28.2.2002. After
the last replacement of the engine at Varnasi on 28.02.2002, he had not reported any
abnormality or snag when he flew to Bhimavaram on the previous day prior to the accident

. flight. The helicopter was re-fuelled at Bhimavaram from epicoated barrels transported by
truck from Hyderabad. The helicopter was having approximately 30 gallons of fuel and had
uplifted 45 gallons (total 75 gallons) for commencing the flight.

A pre-flight inspection schedule was found carried out and signed by the Capt. who
was authorized by Controller of Airworthiness, Bangalore . Capt.G.V.Menon occupied the
right-seat in the cockpit while the speaker occupied the left-seat. His personal assistant was
in the cabin at the rear.

Te

PY 4.1.2. r
f : Capt.G.V.Menon had filed a flight plan with FIC(Exhibit No. 15), Chennai on
telephone, prior to departure from Bhimavaram, FIC, Chennai had approved the flight plan

from Bhimavaram to Hyderabad through direct routing at 3000 feet AGL under Visual Flight

Rules (VFR). The helicopter took-off at about 0735 Hrs (IST) and headed for Hyderabad.

The crash site is about 2-3 nautical miles away to the left of direct routing between

Bhimavaram and Hyderabad.

Apparently, shortly after the take-off, the pilot encountered poor visibility and kept
deviating to the left due to weather. Even after deviation, he continued to encounter poor
visibility due to fog as reported by the eye-witness. Under VFR, the pilot is required to
maintain the visual ground contact, therefore the pilot continued to descend so that the
ground contact is not lost. In doing so, he got into a committed situation wherefrom he was
not in a position to go back. With the worsening visibility, he came so low such that further
flight was risky and he wanted to make a precautionary landing. After steadying the
helicopter, he realized, perhaps due to slight drifting of fog, that he is not on ground but on
water surface almost in the middle of Venkata Ramana Fish Pond. While intiating immediate
corrective action, he pulled up the helicopter without accurately judging his clearance from
water surface and in the process when the nose of the helicopter pulled up, the tail of the
helicopter hit the water bed causing breakage of tail-rotor blades and part of tail-boom.

: With the tail-rotor already rotating at 1700 rpm approx of aircraft engine in full power
when the tail rotor contacted water surface caused disintegration of its tail-boom at about 3
feet from the tail rotor-side. Both the tail-rotor blades sheared off immediately after the
impact and were found floating in the pond. The tail-rotor gear box along-with vertical fin had
sheared off and fallen in the pond at the place where the tail boom hit the water surface and
was lying underneath the water at that location.

After the helicopter tail section hit the water, the breakage of tail-boom caused the
; loss of directional control. The pilot was unaware of the extent of damage to the helicopter
' and with full power, he continued towards the Eastern side of the pond. Since, the engine
!

‘
was developing full power, the helicopter rose to 10 meters above the water surface and
crossed the pond flying through a row of coconut trees and while passing through them, the
tear portion of the helicopter hit the branches of a coconut tree at about 10 ft height (some
coconut leaves were found stuck between horizontal stablizer and tail boom).

Immediately after leaving the Venkata Ramana Fish Pond without directional control
the helicopter started Spinning violently over the adjacent ponds. After making two-three
such violent spinning, it hit the eastern bank of the Mandala Anjaneyulu Fish tank. The
impact had been with the forward body of helicopter making contact with a strong muddy
bank of height 3 to 4 feet. Since, the helicopter was iri spin and had gained sufficient

forward momentum, the structure had collapsed and the occupants were killed due to the
impact.

The fuel tank with rubber cells burst immediately after the impact and all the fuel in the
tank leaked-out into the pond. The workers feeding the fish at Venkata Ramana Fish Pond
and other adjacent fish ponds had watched the whole mishap. After the helicopter crashed
on the bund, the workers rushed to the spot after pause of few minutes and tried to rescue
the occupants.

3 As they approached the wreckage, they found all the three occupants were profusely
Z bleeding without any movement, the pilot in command was struggling for life. Other two
< occupants had already died and after a while , the pilot also died before receiving any first
t aid.
4
t Shri Mani, owner of ‘Mandala Anjaneyulu Fish Pond who was at the spot stated
(Exhibit No. 4) that having identified the person sitting at the left pilot seat as the Hon'ble Lok
6 Sabha Speaker, he immediately informed the local police about the accident.
s The local police immediately rushed to the spot and cordoned-off the area. With the
. help of the local people, the bodies were removed and transported to Eluru Govt. Hospital.
s After the post-mortem of the deceased, bodies were handed over to the relatives/employers.

1.13. MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION
Immediately after the accident, the workers at the fish pond rushed to the site and
tried to rescue the passengers. They had found the passenger sitting on the left-seat of the
cockpit and in the cabin dead. The pilot of helicopter was struggling for life with severe
injuries and within in no time, he also died without receiving any medical/first-aid. Local
Police were informed immediately with the help of cell phone by Shri Mani , owner of
Anjaneyulu Fish Tank. The local police arrived at the site after about half-an-hour of
information and removed the bodies from the helicopter. The bodies were later sent for post-
mortem to Eluru Government Hospital. The post-mortem report (Exhibit No.17) of pilot does
not indicate any incapacitation and / or presence of alcohol.

Fee 1.16 TESTS AND RESEARCH
8 1.16.1 — PROBABLE EMERGENCY CONDITIONS
ye The helicopter flight manual describes the following conditions under which the pilot
¢
@) has to land as soon as possible (as per Chapter No.3) :-
> a) Engine oil pressure low, high or fluctuating
b) Illumination of engine chip light
4S c) Engine failure
( d) Illumination of tail-rotor chip light
e) Tail-rotor control failure
c f) Illumination of transmission chip light

j) Battery hot.
1.16.1.1
For conditions listed under a,b, and , the engine was tested for full performance at
Manufacturers facility and certified to have been working satisfactorily at the time of accident.
The parameters recorded during the test run were normal and to the required specification.
The engine test run was witnessed by the Member of Committee Shri Yashpal, Senior
Manager(Engg.), Pawan Hans Helicopters Limited at Indianapolis, USA. A report (Exhibit
No.5) was submitted by the Original Equipment Manufacturer Rolls Royce, USA. From the
eye-witnesses statements and the evidences collected from the accident site, it has
undoubtedly being corroborated that the engine was developing sufficient power and the
helicopter could climb over 10 meters from the ground level. From the above, it is proved
that the engine was not the contributory factor for the accident.
;
yf For conditions listed under (d) and (e), tail rotor failure could have resulted due loss of
& pitch control, failure of the drive shaft, gear ceasure, missing rotor blades or combination of
> the above conditions. None of the above conditions were prevailing as the helicopter was
is seen approaching straight on a steady flight for landing at the middle of the fish pond. All
i parts of the tail rotor such as rotors, gear box & its attachment, pitch control mechanism were
x found lying under the water at one location, except the tail rotor blades which were floating
> around. It amounts that there was no failure of any of the components of trail rotor system
2 prior to the accident. Also, the analysis carried out by National Aerospace Laboratory
3 reported (Exhibit NO.18) that the breaking of tail boom, tail drive shaft, tail rotor control shaft
Pf and tail rotor blades were due to impact load.
z For conditions (f), (g) and (h), i.e. transmission chip light “ON”: The investigation team
% had inspected the chip detectors of the system and found no metal particles. Further the gear
i box was strip inspected at the Deccan Aviation hangar , in the presence of members of the
¥ 18
©

committee on 29-7

Parts or signs of ze lita. and there was no sign of any damage to the internal
Perating without / less quantity of oil and therefore conditions

under (g) & (h) were not prevalent before the accident.

For condition (i), ie, Main drive shaft failure: Investigated by National Aerospace
Laboratory, Bangalore and revealed that there was no failure of main drive shaft during flight
(Exhibit No. 23).

For condition (j), i.e. Battery hot: The battery condition was checked in the Deccan
Aviation battery shop and found not heating up during rapid charging and discharging and
was found satisfactory, battery temperature sensors were found satisfactory and is not a
contributory factor for making a precautionary landing.
1.16.2 -EXAMINATION OF TAIL-ROTOR UNIT, BOOM & STRUCTURUE
The detached tail-rotor unit consisting of the vertical fin, boom structure, tail-rotor gear
box and the broken rotor blades were tested at National Aerospace Laboratory, Bangalore
and the report submitted by National Aerospace Laboratory (Exhibit No. 18) revealed that the
failure was due to the impact of the tail boom with the water surface. After examining the
report, the tail gear box was strip opened in the presence of the members of the committee
and found to contain mud mixed with oil. Subsequent to cleaning of mud, the Tail Gear Box
j - was found rotating freely .
1.16.3 FUEL FILTER CONTAMINATION TEST
The engine fuel filter was removed and sent to M/s Rolls Royce, Indianapolis, USA for
, detailed examination of any debris accumulated in the filter to ascertain the probable internal
failure of the engine. The Rolls Royce report( Exhibit No.5) indicated that there was no
> metallic material or debris in the filter.
