SUMMARY
M/S Raymonds Ltd. Ecureuil AS 355N, helicopter VT-RLA
was chartered by M/s Air Sahara for Non-Scheduled flight
for Juhu-Race Course-Amby Valley-Juhu sectors on 22.9.02.
The helicopter operated Juhu - Racecourse - Amby Valley
sectors uneventfully. Along with VT-RLA, M/s Air Sahara
helicopters VT-SIP and VT-SIL also operated these sectors

uneventfully. All these three helicopters were scheduled
to depart from Amby Valley for Juhu airport with an
interval of 15 minutes same day evening. After VT-SIP took
off at about 1045 UTC, VT-RLA took off at about 1100 UTC
and was seen setting course straight for Juhu airport.
There were a total of five persons on board. The
visibility was 5 Km with hilltops clear and there were
. drifting clouds. After climb out, the helicopter deviated
from its track and took a right turn. During the right
turn the pilots entered into bad weather at low height and
lost visual reference with the ground. The helicopter
impacted the ground and got disintegrated and was
destroyed due impact and post impact fire. All five
occupants on board received fatal injuries. VT-SIP and VT-
SIL (which took off after 15 minutes of VT-RLA) landed
safely at Juhu airport. VT-RLA was neither in contact with
any ATC unit nor with VT-SIP and VT- SIL.
1. FACTUAL INFORMATION
1.1 History of the flight :
M/S Raymonds Ltd. Ecureuil AS 355N, helicopter VI-
RLA was chartered by M/s Air Sahara for Non-Scheduled .
. flight for Juhu-Race Course-Amby Valley-Juhu sectors on
22.9.02. The helicopter took off from Juhu airport at 0627
. UTC for Race Course under the command of Capt. K. Malhotra
with Capt. N.K. Bhardwaj, as copilot. After picking up
three passengers from Race Course, it took-off and set
course for Amby Valley and landed safely at about 0845
UTC. Two other helicopters VT-SIL and VT-SIP of M/S Air
Sshara had also taken off from Juhu airport on 22.9.2002
and after picking up passengers from Race Course also
landed at Amby Valley alongwith VT-RLA. At about 1045 UTC,
M/S Air Sahara helicopter VT-SIP took off from Amby Valley
for Juhu airport under the command of Capt. Deepak Dhermy
with Capt. Rakesh Sharma as copilot. There were four
passengers on board. Prior to take-off, the pilots had
checked up the weather from Juhu ATC, Visibility was 6
Kms. with clear sky. The weather at Amby Valley was 5 Kms .
cloudy and hilltops were clear though there were drifting
clouds. Capt. Deepak Dhermy had briefed the pilots of VT-
RLA and VT-SIL to take-off after 15 minutes interval.
; After take-off, they(VT-SIP) took one orbit over Amby
valley at an altitude of approx. 500 ft. AGL for about 5-7
minutes to show the area to the visitors on board and then
set course for Juhu airport. M/S Raymond nelicopter VT-RLA
took off from Amby Valley at about 1100 UTC for Juhu
airport under the command of Capt. K. Malhotra with Capt.
N.K. Bhardwaj, as copilot. There were three passengers on
Z

board. Before departure Capt. K. Malhotra had obtained the
weather from Juhu ATC. Capt. A.K.Sen and Co-pilot Capt.
R.S.Dev, who were scheduled to operate VT-SIL, observed
the take-off of VT-RLA from the ground and setting course
directly towards Juhu Airport and was not visible to them
once it went abeam the Koraigarh fort. Thereafter they
took-off with four passengers on board from Amby Valley
and set course straight for Juhu airport at about 1115
UTC. They did not make an orbit over Amby Valley. Prior to
take-off, they had checked up the weather from Juhu ATC.
Visibility was 6 Kms. The weather at Amby Valley was about
5 Kms. cloudy with medium and high clouds. The clouds were
broken and passing clouds in patches about 1000 ft. high.
The hilltops around were generally clear of clouds.

Capt. Deepak Dhermy (commander of VT-SIP) has stated
that after setting course for Juhu airport, after some
time he contacted Mumbai Approach Radar and gave their
position report. They were asked to route via south of
Trombay to Bandra Point. He contacted Spartan Control and
gave their position report. He tried to contact VT-RLA who
was to take-off from Amby Valley helipad but there was no
radio contact. He enquired from Bombay Radar and VT-SIL if
there was any contact with VT-RLA and they replied in
negative. They came over Bandra point and thereafter .

. landed at Juhu airport at about 1134 UTC. Capt. A.K. Sen
(Commander of VT-SIL) has stated that after getting
; airborne, after sometime they contacted Mumbai approach
| around 37 NM. After sometime they got a call from VT-SIP
) asking if there was any contact with VT-RLA. Then they
tried to contact VT-RLA but there was no visual or radio
contact. They also tried to contact Spartan control but
there waS no contact with them. They landed at Juhu
airport at about 1136 UTC. As both the helicopters VT-SIP
and VT-SIL had landed at Juhu airport except VT-RLA,
subsequently, it was found that helicopter VT-RLA had
crashed and its wreckage was found at about 4 Kms from
Amby valley helipad in a nachani field at village
Pethshahpur. After take off, VT-RLA was neither in contact
with Mumbai Radar nor with any other station enroute nor
with other helicopters VT-SIP and VT-SIL which had also
departed from the Amby valley helipad. The helicopter got
destroyed due impact with the ground and post impact fire.
All five persons on board received fatal injuries. One
lady who was working in the nachani field received
superficial burn injuries by the fuel from the helicopter
debris.

5

( equipped with two modular-design TURBOMECA ARRIUS 1 A
turboshaft engines incorporating free-power turbine and
full-authority digital governor. These engines were
mounted at the top of the fuselage to the rear of the main
gear box in two separate fire-proof compartments. The
helicopter was owned, Operated and maintained by M/s
Raymond Limited, Mumbai.

The helicopter had done 2741:10 airframe hrs and 4603
landings since new and 225.50 airframe hrs and 287
landings since last revalidation of C of A. Port engine
(Sl. No. 2001) had done 3448.10 hrs. since new and 1442.10
hrs. since last overhaul and Starboard Engine (Sl. No.
2058) had done 3132 hrs. since new and 1285 hrs. since
last overhaul as on date of accident. The mandatory
modifications were also found complied with.

1.6.2 History of Engines :

The helicopter was fitted with engine Sl.no.2060 on
LHS (#1) and engine sl.no.2058 on RHS (#2) at the time of
issue of C of R and initial C of A. No.1 engine
(Sl.no.2060) was replaced with sl. no. 2001 on 2 ode e000,
No. 2 engine (sl. no.2058) was replaced with sl. no. 2080
on 9.3.98. Thereafter, it was replaced with sl. no. 2012 .
on 24.11.98 and again replaced with sl no. 2058 back at
no. 2 position on 21.7.2001.
1.6.2.1 History of Engines (including components) installed

and replaced on LHS (sl.no.2060 & sl.no.2001)

Engine Sl.no.2060 was replaced with Sl. no. 2001 on
2.3.2000, since on 12.2.2000 the pilot had reported that
while repositioning the helicopter, the #1 engine started
and all parameters observed normal and just before
Starting no.2 engine a loud thud noise was heard and #1
engine was switched off. During rectification combiner
gear box input flange and its mounting bolts were found
Sheared and were replaced. Both MCD, oil filter and fuel
Filter were checked and no chips were found. Compressor,
turbine blades checked for condition and freedom of
rotation and found Satisfactory. Air intake grid plenum
casing checked and no abnormality found. Exhaust cone
Checked and found Satisfactory. Boroscopic inspection of
compressor, combustion chamber, gas generator turbine,

: free power turbine, MGB, combiner gear box carried out and
found satisfactory. The helicopter was given ground run
and during ground run No.1 engine started but Ng did not
Pick up beyond 22%. Engine was switched off. The engine-
#1(S.N.2060) was then removed on 29.2.2000. At the time of
removal, the engine had done 1825.15 hrs Since new/since

6

last O/H. The removed engine Sl.no.2060 was sent to M/s.
Turbomeca for investigation. Investigation report revealed
that on dismantling of no.2 module, heavy signs of erosion
on air path, diffuser assembly, centrifugal wheel, nozzle
guide vane and HP blades were observed.

The engine sl.no.2001 was installed in place of sl.
no. 2060 on 2.3.2000. At the time of installation, the
engine had done 2535 hrs since new and 529 hrs since last
overhaul. On 16.4 2001, HP pump Sl no. 401 B was removed
at 1950.45 component hrs.(life 2000 hrs.) and replaced
with new and serviceable HP pump sl. no. 346 M. On
13.7.2001, during switch off, leak was found from drain
valve of HP pump of # 1 engine. Leak was beyond
permissible limits. HP pump (Sl. no. 346 M which was
installed on 16.4.2001 with 00 component hrs.) was
suspected faulty and same was replaced. On 14.2 2002, at
Juhu airport, # 2 engine failed to start and # 1 engine
chip light flickered. For rectification of the snag on
no.l engine, reduction gear box and rear bearing MCD were
checked and fine metal dust was found on both the chip
detectors. The oil filter was checked and no metal
particles were found. The oil system was drained and no
metal particles were found. The engine oil system was
flushed and on subsequent ground run no warning light
illuminated. After ground run, negligible dust found on-

; both the chip detectors. Same were cleaned and fitted
back. Test flight was carried out and no warning light

; came ON. The chip detectors and oil filter did not
indicate any metal particle. Engine run down time was 44

seconds. Boroscopic inspection on engine (sl.no.2001) was
carried and found satisfactory. Thereafter the helicopter

was released for flying. On 5.3.2002 at Aurangabad, the

Pilot had reported that five minutes after take off,

Surging sound was heard from No.1 engine. All other
parameters were observed normal. The helicopter landed

back safely. During rectification the engine was checked
externally and no abnormality was observed. Front and rear

MCDs were checked and were found clean. Engine filter was

opened and negligible amount of metal dust was’ found.
Boroscopic inspection of compressor blades and_= gas

generator turbine blades was carried out and =e =~»*no
abnormality was observed. Boroscopic inspection of
combustion chamber revealed black carbon deposit. Visual
inspection of free turbine, after exhaust pipe removal,

revealed rubbing marks on turbine casing. Free turbine

could be rotated by hand without any rubbing noise.
Rotation of gas turbine assembly was normal and no rubbing

, noise was observed. Engine run down time was 42 seconds.
P2/P3 sensors of both the engines were swapped and the
helicopter was given ground run. During the ground run,

7

4

surge noise was heard again from #1 engine. The helicopter
WaS switched off. During further rectification, the HP
pump was swapped with that of #2 engine. The helicopter
WaS again given ground run and again surge noise was heard
from #1 Engine. It was decided to replace the engine
(Sl.no.2001). Because of non-availability of complete
engine, it was decided to replace module-2 as per the
advice of Turbomeca. No.1 engine was removed for Module-2
replacement on 22.3.2002 and was installed back on
24.3.2002 after Module-2 replacement and completion of
power assurance check and test flight. At the time of
Change, module-2 had done 00 component hrs. The engine had

done 3320.40 hrs since new and 1314.40 hrs since last
Overhaul.

On 25.3.2002, the helicopter operated one _. non-
Scheduled flight from Auragabad to Juhu airport.
Thereafter, it did not operate any flight up to 4.4.2002.
On 5.4.2002 at Juhu airport, the Pilot reported that no.1
engine chip light came ON during ground run. The
helicopter was switched off. The engine was again removed
on 5.4.2002 for replacement of Module-1. It was re-
installed on 9.4.2002 after replacement of the module and
completion of power assurance check. At the time of
change, module-1 had done 389 components hrs. The engine -

; had done 3322.50 hrs since new and 1316.50 hrs. since last
overhaul.

Both the removed modules were sent to M/s Turbomeca
for defect investigation. The investigation report
revealed that particles from No.1 Module were due to the
flaking of output gear rear bearing outer ring. M/s
Turbomeca had developed the modification TU98. This TU98
modification introduces an angular displacement of anti-
rotation tab located on the output gear rear housing. This
modification would reduce the stress on the outer ring.
The investigation report of Module-2 revealed after having
noticed significant erosion on the centrifugal diffuser
during disassembly, further investigations were carried
out on the different parts and revealed that the surge
phenomenon was probably due to the rupture of centrifugal
diffuser radial vanes on the leading edges. The radial
vane complete detachment led to a modification of the
resonance conditions of these vanes, which became free on

one end, and thus rupturing 13 vanes by vibratory fatigue
and cracking 4 others.

On 25.7.2002, fuel was found leaking from no.1 engine
combustion chamber drain valve line during inspection for
weekly ground run as booster pump was put ON. Pressuring
Valve/Starting Electro valve was suspected faulty and same

8

was replaced with new one. During ground run, no leak was
observed and the helicopter was released for flying.

On 13.8.2002 at Juhu airport, the Pilot reported that
during start up of #1 engine, there was no torque meter
indication. All other parameters were found normal. During
rectification suspected torque meter transmitter was
replaced with new one and checked for security of
attachment and the helicopter was released for flying.

On 4.9.2002 at Juhu airport, fuel was found leaking
from LP pump drive shaft sealing ring drain line of # 1
engine as the booster pump was put ON. During inspection,
LP pump was suspected faulty and the same was replaced
with an overhauled pump. During ground run, no leak was
observed and the helicopter was released for flying.
1.6.2.2 History of Engines (including components) installed

and replaced on RHS (sl. nos. 2058,2080 & 2012)
: No. 2 engine (Sl. no. 2058) was replaced with Sl. No.
2080 on 9.3.98 since on 26.2.98 at Juhu airport, the Pilot
reported that five minutes prior to landing, RH engine
chip warning light flickered. All other engine parameters
were normal. During rectification, chips were found in.
: Accessory Gear Box Magnetic Chip Detector. The system was
flushed. Engine ground run was carried out for 30 minutes
and chip light flickered again. Chips were found again in
Accessory Gear Box Magnetic Chip Detector. Engine
(sl.no.2058) was suspected unserviceable and it was
replaced with engine sl. no. 2080 on 9.3.98. At the time
of replacement, the engine Sl.no.2058 had done 1127.15 hrs
Since new and engine sl. no. 2080 had done 2387 hrs. since
new and 198 hrs. since last overhaul.

The engine sl.no.2058 was sent to M/s. Turbomeca for
defect investigation. Investigation report revealed that
the output shaft rear bearing deterioration was found in
Module-l1 and a severe air path erosion was noticed
(Module-2) particularly on centrifugal compressor, radial
diffuser and Tl blades and Flame tube omega film was found
cracked.

On 24.11.98 , engine sl. no. 2080 was also replaced
with sl. no. 2012 since on 17.11.98 at Raipur, the Pilot

reported that no.2 engine oil pressure was fluctuating.
During rectification, LOP s/w pressure transmitter was
Cleaned. Oil filter was checked and engine ground run was
Given. During ground run,  no.2 engine oil pressure
continued fluctuating. During rectification oil filter was
removed and fine pazticles were found and MCD was found

9

OK. System was flushed with new oil. Low Pressure switch
was checked and found OK. The engine was again given
ground run. During ground run, no.2 engine oil pressure
continued fluctuating and chip light flickered
momentarily. During rectification, fine particles were
found at rear MCD and oil filter. The helicopter was
grounded and the engine (Sl.no.2080) was replaced with sl.
no. 2012 on 24.11.98. At the time of replacement, the
engine sl. no.2080 had done 2555.05 hrs since new and
366.05 hrs since last overhaul. It had flown 168.05 hrs
after installation on #2 position on VT-RLA.

The engine sl no. 2080 was sent to M/s. Turbomeca for
defect investigation. Investigation report revealed that
on free turbine bearing, there was abnormal wear of balls
and bearing cage was damaged(consequential damage). Apart
from degradation of free turbine ball bearing, flaking of
rear half internal ring raceway was also observed.

On 21.7.2001, the engine sl. no. 2012 was replaced
with engine sl. no. 2058 (which was initially installed on
VT-RLA and was sent to Turbomeca for defect investigation
following an incident at Juhu airport on 26.2.98). At the
time of removal of sl. no. 2012, it had done 3498.52 hrs.
Since new and 1914.50 hrs. since last overhaul (TBO being ~

, 2000 hrs.). At the time of re-installation of the engine
sl. no. 2058 on 21.7.2001, it was found to have done 2761

. hrs since new and 914 hrs since last overhaul. As per
entries made in Manufacturers log book, on 12.4.2001 the
engine had been removed from the airframe following an
incident abroad and was returned to Turbomeca for test run
and power assurance check. Igniter and fuel pump had been
replaced. On the day of accident, the engine sl. no. 2058
was found installed on VT-RLA on no.2 position.

On 4.2.2002 at Delhi, No.2 engine failed to start.
During rectification, electrical wiring and start electro
valve was checked and found satisfactory. Relay 53K was
suspected faulty and was replaced with new 53K relay and
operation was found satisfactory during ground run.

On 14.2.2002 at Juhu airport, no.2 engine failed to
start and No.1 engine chip light flickered. During
rectification work on no. 2 engine, Combustion chamber

; drain valve was checked and found satisfactory. HE
ignition unit and HE igniter were checked and _ found
Satisfactory. Start injector of # 2 engine swapped with

that of # #1 engine and found no- improvement.
Starting/pressurizing valve of # 2 engine swapped from # 1
_ €ngine and found no improvement. HP pump metering valve of
No.2 engine replaced with new HP pump and found no
10

improvement. The old HP pump was fitted back. LP pump of #
2 engine swapped with that of # 1 engine and found no
improvement. Confirmation box of T4.5 without resistance
swapped and found no improvement. Tl probe was replaced
with new probe and found no improvement and the old one

i fitted back. Ng probe was swapped from # 1 engine, contact
was cleaned and the engine started.

" 1.6.3 Scrutiny of the defect register of VT-RLA revealed
that some incidents were merely recorded as snags in the
past and serious snags were recorded to have been noticed
on ground after the last flight. Few of them are
enumerated below: |
i) On 22.8.99 at Kandla, the Pilot reported that during
No.1 engine starting, TGB chip light came ON. During
rectification, TGB MCD were checked and found fine metal
particles. TGB oil was drained and found its colour
brownish and fine metal dust particle found in oil. TGB
oil system was flushed and ground run was carried out.
During ground run, TGB chip light came ON again. During
further rectification, on checking the chip detector and
TGB oil, fine metal dust particle ring was found. TGB
assembly was suspected unserviceable and the same was
replaced with new one. However, scrutiny of the journey

. log book did not reveal any incidents/observations of any >
similar snag on the previous sectors, which is quite
unlikely as suddenly TGB chip light coming ON during

engine starting would not require replacement of TGB

assembly.
ii) On 26.9.99 at Juhu airport, nil vibrations were found
recorded in the Pilot Defect Register(PDR). The journey
log book also showed nil incidents/observations for this
date. However, nil snag was found struck off and heavy
vibrations were written over that column. During
rectification vibration check was carried out and Starflex
and frequency adopters were replaced with new and
serviceable starflex and frequency adopters. Free turbine
wheel of # 1 engine was also changed as it was left with
118 Nf cycles of its stipulated life. It is quite unlikely
that without experiencing vibrations in earlier sectors,
Starflex and frequency adopters required replacement on
ground.

: iii) On 23.5.2000 at Juhu airport, nil snag was found
recorded in the Pilot Defect Register (PDR). In the

. journey log book also nil incidents/observations were
found recorded for this date. However, in the
rectification column it was mentioned that after last
flight check, found all three spherical thrust-bearings

1]

i |
having a circumferential crack. All three bearings were
replaced with new and serviceable spherical  thrust-
bearing. It 1s quite unlikely that without experiencing
vibrations in earlier sectors, all three spherical thrust-
bearings required premature removal after the last flight

There is no Met office at Amby Valley. Before
departure from Amby Valley for Juhu Airport, the
destination weather is obtained from Met office at Juhu
airport. The assessment of inflight visibility and actual
local weather lies with the flight crew to make their own

: decisions. On the day of accident, as per the pilots of
VT-SIP who took-off about 15 minutes prior to VT-RLA, the

visibility was 5 KMs cloudy and hilltops were clear though
there wag aQrifting clouds. The passing clouds were
generally coming from west/north west direction near the
Amby Valley area and were above their helicopter. As per
the pilots of VT-SIL who took-off about 15 minutes after
VT-RLA, the visibility was 5 kms. cloudy with medium and
high clouds. The clouds were broken and passing clouds in
patches of about 1000 ft high. The hill tops around were
generally clear of clouds.

According to one lady eyewitness who was working in
the nachni field where the accident took place, the
weather was Dhuka (foggy), the visibility became poor and
it was dark as well.

1.8 Aids to Navigation : Amby Valley is located on radial
135 and 42 NM from Bombay VOR and the routing is direct
via south of Trombay.

. 1.9 Communications : As per the log entries from
Mumbai ATC, the helicopter VT-RLA was not in their contact

after departure from Amby Valley. Also VT-RLA was neither
in contact with other two helicopters VT-SIL & VT-SIP nor
with Kunjali (Naval) ATC.
1.10 Aerodrome Information : The helipad at Amby Valley is
a VFR helipad. It was located within the premises of Amby
Valley housing complex having proper security
arrangements. It had a space to park three helicopters.
The approach to land/ take-off to helipad was 12°/30°.
1.11 Flight Recorders : Neither fitted nor required.
1.12 Wreckage and Impact Information :

Examination of the crash site revealed that wreckage
was lying on the right side (about 90°) of helicopter
normal track to Juhu airport. The first contact of

helicopter with the ground was found in the form of four
consecutive blade marks (main rotor blade tip hitting the
ground more and more deeply) separated by a maximum
. distance of about 14 ft. These marks were curved slicing
the ground to a depth of approx 3 inches. Of one of the
main rotor blade, a piece of roughly 60 cms. was not
traceable but some part belonging to this piece was traced
13

about 70 meters on left side of the final trajectory of
the helicopter indicating that the blade was badly damaged
while hitting the ground. A tree trunk cut with an angle
gave the indication of the fifth contact mark of the main
rotor blade. This angle suggested the inclination of about
50° to the right on the roll axis when the main rotor of
the helicopter hit the ground. There was also a ground
mark (skid) alongside the first blade mark indicating the
possibility of helicopter initially impacting the ground
in right bank attitude. After the tree trunk cut, a lot of
debris from the canopy was lying on the ground. Thereafter
it bounced clearing over two trees about 6 ft high and
started disintegrating in the forward motion and caught
fire. It rolled through a sloppy nachani field and finally
impacted with the number of boulders (stones). Both the
engines, transmission and root portion of main rotor
blades were found near the final rest point at about 165
meters from the initial impact. A second impact was
noticeable at a distance of about 60 meters after the
first impact. Splines of one engine/MGB coupling shaft was
also found near the main wreckage. A portion of tail boom,
TGB and broken tail rotor blades found lying at a close by
distance. Vertical fin and tail rotor head, did not have
any fire damage indicating that there was no inflight
fire. There were severe burnt areas before the final -
. impact area, which indicated that the fuel was sprayed
during the final trajectory after impact and also
: indicating that the fire was post crash. Both digital
engine control units were found in burnt condition. The
wreckage diagram is shown at Annexure-l.
The wreckage was shifted in the hanger of Million
Air, a division of M/S Raymonds Ltd., at Juhu airport. The
main wreckage including the engines was examined in
association with two specialists from Eurocopter and
Turbomeca who were deputed to India to assist/participate
on behalf of BEA, France in accordance with the provisions
of ICAO Annex 13. The following observations were made:
Engine/MGB coupling shafts :
On both the shafts, the splines of the flange were
broken. Aspect of the fractures was characteristic of a
pure torsion rupture corresponding to an overtorque in the
transmission line between the main rotor blades and the
engines. This overtorque occurred when a main rotor blade
hit the ground while engines giving power. The condition
: of both flex couplings on both shafts indicated no
misalignment.
14
é

Combiner gearbox:
| After removal from the main gearbox, it turned freely
and condition of all the gears was satisfactory. The two
Freewheels were found jammed in the working position and
; could not be disengaged. When the freewheel is engaged,
the rollers are held tightly between the top of the bosses
on the freewheel shaft and the input pinion bore so the
‘ pinion is driven by the shaft. In the case of an
overtorque due to a blade rotor Strike while engine
running, the bore of the pinion is buckled by the rollers
under the increasing pressure loads which results in
making hollowed marks. So the freewheel gets jammed in
this position.
Main gearbox: |

The condition of the gears was satisfactory and the
bearing turned freely. The oil pump module was in normal
condition considering that the TBO of the main gearbox was
practically reached.

Tail rotor drive system:

The forward shaft was found bent and the coupling
Found broken. The two bearings on the fan drive shaft
turned freely without resistance. Blades of the rotors

; were not broken and no rotation marks could be seen on the
broken stators. The condition of the intermediate shaft

was satisfactory without coupling failures. The long rear
shaft was found broken in two parts (static failure) and
all the six bearings turned freely without any resistance.
Tail rotor gearbox and tail rotor:

The gearbox was still fitted on the tail boom and
turned freely without resistance. The pitch change device
worked normally. The two pitch change links were found
bent. There was no indication of imbalance at the
attachment points.

Main rotor: |

The main rotor mast did not indicate any abnormality
and the four contacts ball bearing turned freely without
resistance. The rotating scissors and the stationary
scissors were in satisfactory condition. The ball bearing

of the swash plate turned freely without resistance. One
pitch link was found bent and all the three were still

attached with the blade horn lever. The droop restraining

, ring was found buckled by the droop restrainers. On the
Starflex rotor head, two arms were found broken in the

drag direction (typical 45° angle rupture following a main

15
ee

rotor strike) and the third one was mainly broken in the
flapping direction (typical 90° angle rupture). All the
three bushes fitted at the end of the arms were still
3 bonded. The spherical thrust bearings as well as the
; frequency adapters were in satisfactory condition. The
. : damages on the sleeve flanges were the consequence of the
is main rotor blades strikes.
Main rotor blades:
f
: On one of the blade, the spar was broken two times
i with evidence of leading edge strike and tip strike. On
the other blade, a 60 cm part at the end of the blade was
| found broken. On the third, the spar was broken roughly at
: 60 cm from the tip. Evident ground marks could be seen at
the tip.
: Tail rotor blades:
One blade was found broken at the middle with
evidence of a tip trailing edge strike. The second broke
_ mear the blade cuff. There was no evidence of rupture
while turning but static rupture when the tail hit the
ground. These observations indicated that when the blades
hit the ground the tail rotor shaft was not in power. This
implied that these damages were consecutive to the
. Engine/MGB coupling shafts ruptures. This also explained
why there was no evidence of imbalance.
Skid landing gear:

The front cross tube was found broken in three parts:
the horizontal part of the front cross tube between the
two landing supports was not bent which indicated very low
crash vertical speed. The front cross tube was found bent
and broke in the forward direction. The same observations
could be made on the horizontal part of the rear cross
tube between the two landing supports. The two skids were
broken but not bent. The manner in which the skids landing
gear broke indicated that the vertical speed was very low
when the aircraft impacted the ground.

Flight controls and hydraulic system:
Most of the flight control lines located under the
| Floor were found broken in very little parts and had been
badly damaged by the fire. All fractures observed were
typical of static rupture (45°. angle rupture). The
deformations of the pilot cyclic stick were in accordance
: : with the direction of the crash and indicated it was
firmly held by the pilot. No noticeable observations could
be made on the copilot cyclic stick and the two collective

16
é
ie erence opera ad eA I Pe peor gee escreterremioe mane eee sa secant pg ps case

: sticks. These two observations seemed to indicate that
there was no conflict between the two pilots. All
: actuators of the Auto-Pilot were severely damaged by the
fire. The main servo-controls were still fitted on the
: main rotor, one piston was bent near the mounting on the
‘ : mast casing. The extension of the piston was the same for
t two of them (8 cms. from the end of the lower cylinder to
the axis of the mounting bolt). On the left one whose
’ : piston was bent, the measurement was higher (9 cms.). It
’ may indicate the possibility of a lateral position of the
cyclic stick. The tail servo-control was partially damaged
; by the fire as well as the load compensator. The two
; hydraulic pumps were removed from the combiner gearbox
without any fracture of the splined shafts. The two
: hydraulic units (regulating valve, filter and pressure
. Switch) were still fitted on the main gearbox but were
; partially burnt. All the flexible hoses had been burnt.
Pilot seat:
On the bucket of the pilot seat, there was no
_ evidence of high vertical load factor (the lateral walls
were not crushed). The back of the seat was broken at the
| Junction with the bucket indicating high horizontal load
factor.
. Tailboom, stabiliser and fins:
The tailboom was broken in two parts but the Junction
with the fuselage was found totally burnt. Observations of
the burnt areas indicated that it was due to a post crash
fire. The horizontal stabiliser was still fitted to the
tailboom, the right side outer third was detached. A heavy
distortion corresponded to an impact with a stone. The
upper fin was still attached to the tail boom and heavy
distortion of the top corresponded to an impact with the
ground. The lower fin was torn out with heavy distortion
? of the tail guard following impact with the ground.
The general observations indicated that the body
Structure and the rear structure was found to be entirely
burnt. The bottom structure and the cabin floor were found
Broken in little pieces which indicated a high energy
impact. Instruments and electronic equipments located in
the front part of the cabin did not have post crash fire
evidence, but were severely damaged. The warning panel was
in a relatively better condition. Concerning the "NG and
failure electronic unit! only the selectors panel located
on the instrument panel was remaining, the electronic unit
. itself had not been recovered as located in the totally
burnt rear structure. The two fire extinguisher bottles
Showed evidences of Overpressure (distortion of the
17
a ee

percussion heads) indicating that these had not been used

, in flight.

Engines:

r The general condition of both the engines revealed

: that these were superficially burnt by post crash fire.
E Gas generator casings, accessories, pipes were severely

E distorted, exhaust pipes were severely distorted and free

turbines and gas generators were found seized.

| On LHS engine, no particles were found in the front

7 plug. The rear plug was missing (area severely distorted

on impact). On RHS engine, no particles were found in both

| plugs.

Inspection of the fuel and oil filters revealed that
on LHS engine, filters and o'rings were partially burnt.

| On RHS engine, no particles were found in filters.

DECU’s were found burnt by post crash fire.

Inspection of centrifugal compressors of both the

. engines revealed no visible damage on the blades except
presence of soil and soot ingested in the air path.

Inspection of combustion chambers revealed presence
of ingested soil.

Power turbines casings were found distorted. Both
free turbines showed evidences of heavy rubbing between
rear faces of turbine disks and distorted exhaust pipe
cones with blue coloration on the cone metal. Rubbing
traces were also visible on the trailing edges of turbine
blades.

The ingestion of soil, the heavy rubbing traces on
free turbines and exhaust cones in addition with the fact

| that both transmission shafts between engines and MGB had
| been found sheared (torsion fracture) and evidences of
Overtorque had been detected on MGB free wheels indicated

, that both engines were running and delivering power at the
time of impact.

; However in order to determine the exact amount of
power demanded at the time of crash and to find out the
internal conditions of the engines, taking into account

18

2 the history of engines, it was felt that the strip

examination of the engines was necessary. However, the
| same could not be done at that time due non-availability
| of the required tools and was done at a subsequent date.

; Lsi3 Medical and pathological information : Capt. K.
Malhotra and Capt. N.K. Bhardwaj had undergone preflight
medical examinations by their company doctor on _ the
morning of 22.9.2002 and were found medically fit to
operate the flight. After the accident, all five occupants
on board received fatal injuries. Post mortem of all five
bodies were carried out at Khandala hospital.

Post mortem of the body of Capt. K. Malhotra revealed
that the opinion as to the probable cause of death was
upper and lower limbs were amputed, crushed, multiple
fractures and head amputed, ribs fractured, multiple
abdominal parts were crushed, teared haemonorage shock in
air accident.

| Post mortem of the body of Capt. N.K. Bhardwaj
revealed that the opinion as to the probable cause of
death was superficial multiple burns, abdomen crushed,
teared and head injury; haemorrage shock; upper and lower
limbs multiple fracture in air accident.

Post mortem of bodies of other three passengers on

board revealed that the opinion as to the probable causes
of death were mainly due to multiple injuries, head
injuries and haemorrage etc. due to shock in air accident.
1.14 Fire : There was post impact fire.

1.15 Survival aspects : The accident was not survivable.
1.16 Tests and research:
1.16.1 The damaged parts of the helicopter viz: Main Gear
Box (MGB) drive shafts (2), Broken flange spline (male),
Broken ends of the tail drive shaft, Main rotor blades end
surface and Droop stops were sent to Research &
Development Directorate at DGCA Hqrs., New Delhi for
metallurgical examination. During Visual and Macro
examination under a stereomicroscope upto a magnification
of 40X, the following observations were made :
, i) Main Gear Box (MGB) drive shafts and broken flange
‘ spline (male) member :
Both the MGB drive shafts were found broken at the same
locations. The fractured surfaces were found flat and
19

: completely rubbed off. Few spots of virgin fracture coul:
: be located at different regions. There was no evidence o
é any shear lip or plastic deformation etc. The spline
if region of the drive shaft showed no evidence of any crac}
: or failure. The spline teeth flanks observed to have
. : shallow bite marks/impression probably caused by the
. mating teeth of the female member. There was also nc
¥ evidence of any twisting / bending of the drive shafts.
; The splines of both the failed drive shafts and the broker
: spline (male) member were found intact.
11) Broken ends of the tail drive Shaft:
R One end portion of the failed drive Shaft revealed a slant
. and fibrous fracture. There was no evidence of any
progressive damage. The other end portion indicated
brittle fracture having dull appearance. There was an
evidence of ovality and transverse cracks on the outside
Surface of this portion.
: 111i) Main Rotor blades end Surface:
The outside surface of the broken end was observed to have
shallow wear impression marks throughout its
Circumference. There was no evidence of any
deterioration/damage marks on these surfaces.
iv) Droop stops: Excessive flapping marks were observed
. on the top and inside surfaces of the droop stops. The
| severity of flapping marks had caused the bending of the
middle flange of the droop stops.

Further, Scanning Electron Microscopic (SEM)
examination was also carried out of the fractured surface
of the broken spline (male) and the fractured surfaces of
the broken ends of the tail drive shaft. The SEM
examination of broken Spline showed the presence of the
Shear dimples on the fractured surface at various
locations. SEM examination of the broken ends of the tail
drive shaft indicated the presence of equiaxed dimples on
the slant and fibrous fracture on one broken end portion.
Presence of shrinkage cavities, exposed dendrites having
Micro cracks, which are mostly confined to the outer

| dendrite layers and equiaxed dimples on the fractured
Surface of the other end portion were observed. Presence
of cavities, dendrites and rubbing marks on the inside
Surface of the failed portion of the tail drive shaft were
/ Observed. Presence of Cavities, dendrites and cubbing
marks in the outer Surface of the same end portion of the

tail drive shaft were observed.

20
&

The above laboratory examination revealed that the
failure of both the MGB drive shafts and the broken spline
male member had occurred primarily under shear over load
conditions. The evidence of shear dimples confirmed the

| failure of these parts under shear overload conditions.
; There was no evidence of any progressive damage. The
evidence of dimpled, rough and brittle fracture surface
textured along with the presence of transverse cracks on
° one side of the outer surface confirmed the failure of the
tail drive shaft broken ends under overload condition in
bending.
1.16.2 Both the engines were strip examined in the hanger
of Million Air at the Juhu airport in association with a
specialist from Turbomeca who was deputed to India along
with the required tools to assist/participate on behalt of
BEA, France in accordance with the provisions of ICAO
Annex 13 and following observations were made:
LHS engine (sl. no. 2001)
Before strip examination of the engine, during visual
inspection the general condition of the engine revealed
that engine was superficially burnt due to post crash
fire, however the engine was exposed to the heat for
considerable time causing oil coking within the engine.
Both modules were damaged due to impact during crash and
all pipes were badly distorted. Power and gas generator
. turbine were found seized and there was big distortions at
turbine casing bottom flange and it was found slightly
bent.
All pipes and electrical control harness were removed in

1.16.3 The engine oil collected from the oil cooler at the
crash site was analysed for the soap test at  PHHL
facilities, Mumbai and the result was found to be within
limits. Both the hydraulic pumps were opened and no damage
to gear and outer casing was observed. Auto-pilot control
and annunciator panel’s bulb filament conditions were
, examined at Air India facilities, Mumbai. However, nothing
conclusive could be established. No information from GPS
could be obtained. ;
1.17 Organizational and management information :

: 1.18 Additional information :

; 1.18.1 At the accident site, ten cans of Mobil Jet-II, 5

f litre can of hydraulic oil, tool box and one spare

: aircraft battery were found. M/s Raymonds Ltd. were

; requested the reason for carrying these items on board for

. é Juhu-Amby Valley-Juhu sectors. They intimated that ten
: cans of Jet-II and 5 litre can of hydraulic oil and tool

: box were not carried on board their helicopter for this

' particular flight. They further intimated that since the
: helicopter was hired by ‘Air Sahara’, the possibility of

‘Air Sahara’ requesting their crew members to carry the

above referred items in VT-RLA helicopter on the return
flight to Mumbai, due to limitation of space in their

: baggage compartment could not be ruled out and they
further intimated that the same may be confirmed from Air
Sahara. Regarding the reason for carrying one spare

battery onboard, they intimated that prior to operating

the flight on 22.9.2002, they had earlier operated flight

to Pune on 20.9.2002 and a spare battery was sent as

| abundant precaution by road, since the helicopter was
expected to make multiple starts at Pune. After completion

| of the flight at Pune, the spare battery was placed

: onboard the helicopter, close to the aircraft battery in

7 the baggage compartment, to bring back to Mumbai, in order
to avoid Octroi problems. The helicopter VT-RLA returned.

° , to Mumbai late in the evening on 20.9.2002 and due to an
Oversight, the battery was not off loaded and remained

} onboard prior to operation of flight to Amby Valley on
: ; 22.9.2002. However, the AME who carried out pre flight
inspection on 22.9.2002 stated that during daily
inspection he had seen the battery lying adjacent to the

: active battery in cargo compartment. Immediately he
instructed the technician to remove the battery and

| he (AME) was continuing his other DI items. However, due to
Over-sight the technician did not off load the spare

battery from the helicopter and he (AME) also assumed that

the spare battery was removed. He further stated that he

: regretted the lapse on his part.

On query from M/S Air Sahara regarding ten cans of

Jet-II and 5 litre can of hydraulic oil, they intimated

that it was an irresponsible statement on the part of

: M/s.Raymonds knowing fully well that loose oil cannot be

: carried on board or in luggage compartment. They further
intimated that moreover, they had so many their company

. vehicles plying up and down from Amby Valley daily and
conveyance of excess baggage, if any by surface transport
. : was not a problem. They further intimated that why
| “M/s Raymonds had made such a statement against them must

| Se seen in correct perspective. It is quite likely that

when the spare battery can be kept on board VT-RLA due to

24

:

oversight by the AME, then the possibility of the ten cans

of Mobil Jet-II and 5 litre can of hydraulic oil and tool

box, keeping on board by M/s Raymonds due to oversight can

; not be ruled out. In view of above and treating of

incidents as mere snags, it is suggested that Safety audit
of M/s Raymonds may be carried out.

; 118.2. BDDS, at the office of BCAS, Mumbai was
E. requested to examine the wreckage at the site from the
point of view of sabotage involving explosive if any. The
: wreckage was examined by BDDS at the site and it was also
E sniffed by explosive sniffer dog. Some bluish powder was
seen scattered on ground, same was tested with field
explosive chemical detection kit, but the result was
- negative. Some quantity of powder was sent for FSL testing
: and confirmation of explosive if any. However the result
was negative. Their report revealed that from the
examination of the wreckage and scrutiny of the statement

of witnesses, it was opined that the accident to the .
subject helicopter can not be attributed to any on board
~~ or external explosion of explosive/explosive device.

. : 2. ANALYSIS
2.1 Serviceability/Maintainability of the helicopter:
2.1.1 The helicopter was manufactured in 1994. It was
| owned, operated and maintained by M/S Raymonds Ltd.,
Mumbai . It was issued with Certificate of Registration
and initial Indian certificate of Airworthiness on
22.12.95. At that time it was fitted with engine sl. no.
2060 on LHS(#1) and engine sl. no. 2058 on RHS(#2). The
. Certificate of Airworthiness was revalidated on yearly
basis and was last revalidated up to 13.12.2002. The
helicopter has done 225 airframe hrs. after last renewal
of C of A. The port engine sl. no 2001 (which was fitted
on LHS at the time of accident) had done 1442.10 hrs. and
: Starboard engine sl. no. 2058 had done 1285 hrs., since
: last overhaul.
° | Scrutiny of documents such as engine log books and
Pilot’s Defect Register revealed that No.1 = engine
. . (Sl.no.2060, which was originally fitted at the time of
, initial issue of C of A and C of R) was replaced with sl.
j no. 2001 on 2.3.2000. Even on this engine both the modules
nad been replaced one after the other. (Module 2 was
25

Fn and after carrying out one non-
scheduled flight, module 1 was replaced on 2-4.2002). No,
; 2 engine (sl.no.2058) was replaced with s1. no. 2080 on
fe 9.3.98. Thereafter, it was replaced with gs]. no. 2012 on
t 24.11.98 and again replaced with sl. no. 2058 back at no.
; 2 position on 21.7.2001.
F The reason for replacement of LHs engine sl. no. 2060
with sl. no. 2001 was that on 12.2.2000 while
, 4 repositioning of the helicopter, loud thud was heard.
: During the process of rectification, it wae decided to
: replace the engine. At the time of replacement, the engine
| (Sl. no. 2060) had done 1825.15 hrs. since New/last
i Overhaul. During disassembly of the engine at Turbomeca,
: heavy signs of erosion on air path, diffuser assembly,
centrifugal wheel, nozzle guide vane and HP blades were
; observed in no.2 module.
: The reasons for replacement of both the modules of
engine sl. no. 2001 were that on 2-3.2002 the -pilot
| reported surging sound after five minutes of take-off and
- landed back. During the Process of rectification, it was
‘ decided to replace the engine. Due to non-availability of
é the complete engine, module-2 was replaced on 22.3.2002.
: Thereafter one non-scheduled Flight was carried out on
ie 25.3.2002. There was no flight till 4.4.2002. on 5.4.2002,
P the pilot reported no. 1 engine chip light came on during
| | ground run. During the Process of rectification, it was
) decided to replace module-1. During disassembly of both
: ji the modules at Turbomeca, module-] revealed flaking of
Output gear rear bearing outer ring. Module-2 revealed
f €rosion on the centrifugal diffuser and during further
disassembly rupture of centrifugal diffuser radial vanes
; on the leading edges.
The reason for replacement of RHS engine 2058 with
| Sl. no. 2080 was that on 26.2.98 the pilot reported
flickering of RHS engine chip warning light about 5 mts.
| before landing. During the process of rectification, it
WaS decided to replace the engine on 9.3.98. At the time
of replacement, the engine (Sl. no.2058) had done 1285
ors. since last Overhaul. Disassembly of the engine at
: Turbomeca revealed that the Output shaft rear bearing
; deterioration was found in Module-1 and severe air path
f ©rosion was noticed (Module-2) particularly on centrifugal
Compressor, radial diffuser and T1 blades and Flame tube
° ! omega film was found cracked.
The reason for replacement of engine sl.no.2080 with
: sl. no. 2012 was that on 17.11.98, the pilot reported no.
2 engine oi] Pressure was Fluctuating. During the process

z of rectification, it was decided to replace the engine on
* 54.11.98. At the time of replacement, the engine (sl.
ie 35.2080) had done 366.05 hrs. since last overhaul.
i Disassembly of the engine at Turbomeca revealed that on
t Free turbine bearing, there was abnormal wear of balls and
. t bearing cage was damaged (consequential damage). Apart from
. degradation of free turbine ball bearing, flaking of rear
é half internal ring raceway was also observed.
The reason for replacement of engine sl. no. 2012
; with sl. no. 2058 was recorded as it had done 1914.50 hrs.
; and TBO was 2000 hrs.
:
From the above, it is therefore evident that all the
; engines maintained by M/s Raymond Ltd. have been removed
: prematurely before completing TBO life of 2000 hrs.
| 27.1.2 On 22.9.2002, Sh. Jaspal Singh Sahans, (AME no.
3439) carried out the Daily Inspection Schedule on VT-RLA
: at Juhu airport at 0445 UTC before the helicopter took-off
: at 0627 UTC for Juhu-Race Course-Amby Valley-Juhu sectors.
: No snag was found recorded by the flight crew in the
previous sector. Fifty hrs./ 30 days schedule/ check had
been carried out on 28.8.2002 and the flight release
: certificate was issued on 28.8.2002 which was valid up to
o ! 26.9.2002 or completion of 2772.55 flying hrs. |
] ; After the accident, the helicopter wreckage was
/ : examined in association with specialists from Eurocopter
and Turbomeca who were deputed to India on behalf of BEA,
| France in accordance with the provisions of ICAO Annex 13.
The examination revealed that the helicopter wreckage was
scattered over an area of approx. 165 meters. There were
. several burnt areas before the final impact area which
indicated that the fuel was sprayed during the final
trajectory after the impact. This also indicated the fire
was a post crash. Vertical fin and tail rotor head also
did not have any fire damage indicating that there was no
inflight fire. The helicopter has hit the ground in a
right bank attitude at very high horizontal speed. One
main rotor blade was badly damaged when the tip hit the
: ground but was not entirely broken at that time indicating
: that it could have hit the canopy as the debris of the
: canopy was lying just after the tree trunk cut main rotor
Dlades. The bottom structure and the cabin floor were
. Oroken in small pieces indicating high energy impact. The
. | corsion fracture of the two engine/MGB coupling shafts
| indicated that the two ongines were delivering power when
; | the main rotor blades hit the ground. There was _ no
| evidence of previous malfunction or previous failure
) pefore the helicopter crashed. All the observed ruptures
. 27
; 0 ee ae ee Te

appeared to be consequent of the crash. Breakage pattern
of the skids indicated that the vertical speed was very
low when the helicopter impacted the ground. Due to the
fire, most of the flight controls components were severly
damaged. All fractures observed were typical of static
° rupture. However there was no evidence of inflight failure
: of flight controls. The two fire extinguisher bottles
showed evidences of overpressure indicating that these had
, not been used in flight.

During examination of the engines, the ingestion of
soil, the heavy rubbing traces on free turbine and exhaust
cones in addition with the facts that both transmission
shafts between engine and MGB had been found sheared
(torsion fracture) and evidences of over torque had been
detected on MGB free wheels indicating that both engines
were running and delivering power at the time of impact.

However, taking in to account the history of the
engines, and to determine whether the engines were
developing required power at the time of crash, the
engines were strip examined in the hanger of Million Air
at Juhu airport in association with a specialist from
Turbomeca who was deputed to India along with the required
tools to assist/participate on behalf of BEA, France in

o accordance with the provisions of ICAO Annex 13. Strip

. examination revealed that the engines were operating and
delivering power at the time of crash. Al] damages

/ observed on this engine resulted from impact from post
crash fire.

Metallurgical examination of Main Gear Box (MGB)
drive shafts (2), Broken flange spline (male), Broken ends
of the tail drive shaft, Main rotor blades end surface and
Droop stops revealed that both MGB drive shafts and of the
broken spline (male) member have failed under’ shear
Overload conditions. One broken end portion of the tail
drive shaft has failed under bending overload conditions.
2.1.3 From the evidences enumerated above, it is evident
that all the engines have been removed prematurely without
completing TBO life of 2000 hrs. However, no
defect/incident was found recorded in PDR/Tech log in the
previous (last) sector operated just prior to the
premature removal of the engines. [It is opined that

> premature removal of engines in the above scenario should
: have left some symptoms 1n the previous sector operated by
_ the lielicopter.
Further, the Scrutiny of the defect register of VT-
RLA revealed that some incidents were merely recorded as
28
Z
-

PO °
ca snags in the past and.serious snags were recorded to have
> been noticed on ground after the last flight e.g. on
% 52.8.99 at Kandla, the pilot reported that during No.1
‘ engine starting, TGB chip light came ON. During the

; 7 process of rectification, TGB assembly was replaced.
17 However, scrutiny of the journey log book did not reveal
. ha any sncidents/observations of any similar snag on the
+ previous sectors. on 26.9.99 at Juhu airport, nil
vibrations were Found recorded in the Pilot Defect
i. Register (PDR) ‘The journey log book also showed nil
ie . ncidents/observations for this date. However, nil snag
4 was found struck off and heavy vibrations were written
+ over that column in the PDR. During the process of
t rectification, Sstarflex and frequency adopters were
; replaced. Free turbine wheel of # 1 engine was also
4 changed as it was left with 118 Nf cycles of its
t stipulated life. On 23.5.2000 at Juhu airport, nil snag
was found recorded in the Pilot Defect Register (PDR). In
B the journey log book also nil incidents/observations were
.- Found recorded for this date. However, — in the
; rectification column it was mentioned that after last
: flight check, found all three spherical thrust bearings
' having a circumferential crack. All three bearings were
F replaced. It is opined that sudden replacement of major
° | components is quite unlikely without leaving symptoms /
: : observations in the earlier sectors. It therefore appears
. ' that though the helicopter was in serviceable condition oF
the day of accident, it 1s necessary that reporting of
j incidents should be taken seriously rather than treatinc
| these as mere snags for the purpose of prope:
: investigation. All incidents should therefore be reportec
' promptly by flight crew and QCM should have effective
c control of monitoring of snags/ incidents for preventior
and recurrence.
| 2.2 Weather :
The pilots had obtained the weather from Juhu airpor™
i before departure for Amby Valley. The area forecast anc
. the forecast weather within 100 NMs which was valid fro
0100 UTC to 1500 UTC on 22.9.2002 was as follows:
Surface wind calm, becoming 290/08 Kts at 10/12 UTC,
. upper winds NW between 05 to 10 kts, weather haze TEMP
. 01-15 thunder showers, Visibility 3000M in Haze becomin-
’ f 6KM and TEMPO 1500M in feeble rain. The cloud amount wa
. | scattered SC 600m to 750M, scattered CU 750M to 5000M
t and broken AC 3000M; TEMPO 1-15 scattered ST 300M, few Co
- 900M to 9000M, overcast AS 2400M with weather warning Nil.

7 since there sg no Met office at Amby Valley, the
j assessment of inflight visibility and actual local weather
é lies with the flight crew to make their own decisions. On
; the day of accident, 4° per the pilots of VT-SIP who took-
3 off about 15 mts. prior to VT-RLA, the visibility was 5
4 KMs cloudy and hill tops were clear though there was
4 drifting clouds. The passing clouds were generally coming
: From west/north west direction near the Amby Valley area
7 and were above their helicopter. As per the pilots of VT-
STL who took-off about 15 mts. after VT-RLA, the
wigibility wae s kms. cloudy with medium and high clouds.
‘ The clouds were broken and passing clouds in patches of
: about 1000 ft high. The hill tops around were generally
clear of clouds.
According to one lady eyewitness who was working in
the nachni Field where the accident took place, the
weather was Dhuka (foggy) and it was dark as well. The
weather had become poor.
:. From the foregoing, it can therefore be inferred
: that though the visibility at the time of take-off from
' Amby Valley was 5 Kms., there were passing and drifting
' clouds and the weather was foggy close to the ground and
‘ the visibility became poor on the right side of track in
: rhe area where the helicopter crashed. The weather 1s
therefore a contributory factor to the accident . :
2.3 Deviation of the helicopter from its normal track
é after take-off from Amby Valley:
, Amby Valley is located on radial 135 and 42 NM from
| Bombay Radar and the routing is direct via south of
Trombay. After VT-RLA had taken off, it was seen by the
flight crew of VT-SIL, who were scheduled to take-off
after 15 mts. of VT-RLA, and it was observed setting
course directly on radial 315 towards Juhu airport and was
not visible to them once it went abeam the Koraigarh fort.
Thereafter, VTI-SIL also took-off after 15 mts. interval.
VT-RLA was neither in contact with Mumbai ATC nor with VT-
SIP, VT-SIL and Kunjali ATC.
: It is quite likely that VT-RLA had deviated from its
: normal track towards right side due some of the reasons
; such as to show the Amby Valley area to the visitors
, (foreigners) on board at their request or drifting clouds
; . coming from west/north west direction or attempting tc
, force land in the field due to technical problem ot
: : attempting to land back at Amby Valley at the request O-
3 the visitors .
30

Considering the possibility of deviation due to
Showing the area to the visitors at their request, it is
felt that the possibility can not be totally ruled out as
the Amby valley area from the air was more prominently
visible from the right side rather than the left side of
the normal track of the helicopter .

Considering the possibility of deviation due attempt
to force land in the field due technical problem, it is
felt that though there were no obstructions around, the
trajectory of the aircraft was not the best in case of an
emergency procedure and most appropriated area to be used
for an emergency landing. In such a Situation, the
horizontal speed of the helicopter would have been much
lower. The horizontal speed of the helicopter was
estimated to be very high (about 150 kts.) which was close
to VNE. The possibility of the helicopter deviating from
the normal track for attempting to force land in the field
is therefore ruled out in view of above circumstances.

) Considering the possibility of deviation due
attempt to land back at Amby Valley helipad due drifting
Clouds, it is felt that since VT-SIP, VT-RLA and VT-SIL
had taken off from the same helipad within an interval of
15 mts. and VT-SIP and VT-SIL had landed at Juhu airport, .
the weather at Ambay Valley was such that the visibility
was 5 kms. and hill tops around were clear though there
were passing/ drifting clouds. These clouds were coming
from West/ North-West direction , and there is a
possibility that the crew deviated to the right to avoid
these clouds and in that area ( where the accident took
place ) the weather was foggy and dark as well and the
visibility had become poor , the crew might have attempted
Co turn back towards Amby valley for landing . Thus the
possibility of the helicopter deviating from the normal
track for attempting to land back at Amby Valley helipad
due drifting clouds can also not be ruled out in view of
above circumstances.

Considering the possibility of deviation due attempt
to land back at Amby Valley helipad at the request of
Visitors, it is felt that the possibility can not be
totally ruled out as the location of the wreckage was such
that it was indicating that the helicopter was in a
continuous right turn on radial 85 ( towards Amby Valley
helipad ) from normal track when it crashed .

2.4 Savnotage aspects:

BDDS, at the office of BCAS, Mumbai was requested to

examine the wreckage at the site from the point of view of
:
|
|

Sabotage involving explosive if any. After the examination
of the wreckage and scrutiny of the statements of
witnesses, it was opined that the accident to the subject
helicopter can not be attributed to any on board or
external explosion of explosive/explosive device.

2.5 Circumstances leading to the accident:

Three helicopters had taken off from Amby valley
helipad within an interval of 15 minutes. VT-RLA was the
second to take-off. The weather at Amby Valley was such
that the visibility was 5 kms. with hill tops clear and
there were drifting clouds. VT-RLA, after take off, was
seen setting course straight for Juhu airport. After climb
out, the pilots turned right side either to avoid
drifting clouds or to show the Amby valley area to
foreigners or to land back at Amby valley at the request
of visitors and while continuing right turn entered into
bad weather in that area as the weather at the site of
accident was foggy and the visibility became poor. While
continuing right banked turn , the pilots lost visual
reference to the ground , main rotor blades hit the ground
more and more deeply and the helicopter bounced and a tree
trunk was cut and it started disintegrating and was
destroyed by the impact and post impact fire. All five
persons on board received fatal injuries.
3. CONCLUSIONS
3.1 Findings :

1. The helicopter held valid Certificate of
Airworthiness.

2. The helicopter held valid flight release
certificate.

3. The pilots held valid licenses while undertaking
the flight.

4. After take-off, the helicopter was seen setting
course straight for Juhu airport on Radial 315 .

5. The visibility at Amby Valley was about 5 kms.
There were medium and high broken and drifting
clouds.

6. The helicopter deviated from its normal track and
took right turn.

32

7. The weather was foggy , the visibility became poor
and it was dark as well on the right side of track.

8. The trajectory was not the best in case of an
emergency landing.

9. During the right turn at low height, the pilots

: entered into bad weather and lost visual reference
with the ground.

10. While continuing the turn on radial 85, the
helicopter banked about 50° to the right and main
rotor blades sliced the ground four times and cut a
tree trunk after clearing two trees.

11. In the process, the main rotor blades cut the
canopy and the helicopter impacted the ground and
started disintegrating and was destroyed due to the
impact and post impact fire.

12. Fxamination of the wreckage/stripping of engines |
revealed that engines were operating and developing
power. There was no evidence of in-flight failure
of flight controls.

13. The accident is not attributed to any on board |
or external explosion of  explosive/explosive
device.

14. The helicopter has not hit any obstructions
before impacting the ground.

15. At the accident site, ten cans of Mobil Jet-IlI,

a 5 litre can of hydraulic oil, tool box and one
additional aircraft battery was found.

16. There was post impact fire.

3.2 Probable cause of the accident :

The pilots after getting airborne turned towards right

side of track and soon thereafter collided with the ground

on losing visual reference due bad weather in that area.
