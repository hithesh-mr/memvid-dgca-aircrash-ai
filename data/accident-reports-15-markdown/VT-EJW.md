Inquiry which investigated accident to Indian Airlines ( SHOD)
Dornier aircraft DO-228 VT-EJW at Kochi on 30th July, 1998.
Indian Airlines (Short Haul Operations Department) Dornier DO-228
aircraft VT-EJW was involved in an accident at Kochi while
operating scheduled flight IC-503 (Kochi to Thiruvananthapuram) on
30th July, 1998. The aircraft had earlier arrived at Kochi at 0505
UTC after operating flight IC-501 from Agati, Lakshadweep Islands.
The pilot did not report any abnormality during the flight from
Agati to Kochi. The aircraft took off from runway 17 at 0534 UTC.
The take off was normal and after attaining a height of about 400
feet, it was seen pitching up steeply to a near vertical attitude
and thereafter appeared to perform
d manoeuvre similar to a stall
turn to the right and crashed on the rooftop of the Component
Repair Shop (CRS) building of the Naval Aircraft Yard. After
impact, the aircraft caught fire and was completely destroyed.
All the six occupants on board the aircraft comprising three crew
members and three passengers received fatal injuries. Three persons
working in the CRS were also fatally injured and six other persons
received minor injuries.
The Government of India had appointed a Committee of Inquiry under
--
Rule-74 of Aircraft Rules, l9t7, headed by Air Marshal P. Rajkumar,
Programme Director (Flight Test), Aeronautical Development Agency,

India, Capt. I.D. Singh, Air India as members and Shri Subhash
Chander, Director Air Safety, Mumbai as Member Secretary.„
,- The
report of the Committee of Inquiry which was received on 16-11-98
is at Annexure A.
The Committee has concluded cause of the accident as under :
"After take off, the aircraft pitched up uncontrollably, stalled,
fell to its right and crashed. The uncontrollable pitch up was
caused by sudden uncommanded downward movement of the Trimma:Ae
r-(cid:9) Horizontal Stabilizer leading edge.(cid:9)
This was due to partial
detachment of its actuator forward bearing support fitting due non-
r".(cid:9) installation of required hi-lok fasteners.
Poor aircraft maintenance practices at Short Haul Operation
Department contributed to the accident."
The Committee of Inquiry has made 49 findings and 7 recommend
- ations which are aimed at enhancing the safety of aircraft
operations. The Government have accepted the report along with
findings, cause and recommendations as indicated in Annexure-I.

HOW IT HAPPENED
proposed
(Reconstructed by the Committee in consultation with experts from
Dornier Luftfahrt GmbH)
3.1.24(cid:9) During take off, the(cid:9) Noted
Pilot-in-Command
r.ntated the aircraft
by moving the control
column(cid:9) backward
thereby holding on to
a pull force.
3.1.25 As a normal reaction, Noted
the Pilot-in-Command
trimmed out the pull
force by blipping the
trim switch to move
the THS leading edge
(LE) down.
3,1.26(cid:9) As— the THS LE moved(cid:9) Noted
down, the down load
on the THS and
elevator increased,
which resulted in a
pushy force on the
actuator attachment
fitting on Frame 34.
3.1.27(cid:9) Following(cid:9) gear(cid:9) Noted
retraction as the
aircraft accelerated,
to counter the nose
up trim change the
Pilot-in-Command
pushed the control
column(cid:9) slightly
forward moving the
elevator(cid:9) trailing
edge (T.E.) down.
3.1.28(cid:9) To trim out this push(cid:9) Noted
force, the Pilot-in-
Command(cid:9) trimmed
forward to move the
THS LE up, thereby
converting the push
force in area of
Frame 34 to a pull

3.1.29 At(cid:9) that(cid:9) stage(cid:9) of Noted
flight,(cid:9) the(cid:9) THS
actuator(cid:9) forward

increase(cid:9) in(cid:9) the arm

actuator(cid:9) moving(cid:9) the
THS LE down.
3.1.31 Movement of(cid:9) the THS Noted
LE down(cid:9) resulted(cid:9) in
the initial pitch up
of the aircraft.
3.1.32 Piich(cid:9) up(cid:9) of(cid:9) the Noted
aircraft(cid:9) at(cid:9) that
stage(cid:9) prompted(cid:9) the
Pilot-in-Command(cid:9) to
push the control
column forward, which
moved the elevator TE
down creating an
upward force at the
rear end of the
THS/elevator surface.
3.1.33(cid:9) Considering(cid:9) the(cid:9) Noted
location of the hinge
line and the centre
of pressure of the
THS, the upward force
rotated the THS LE
further down to 14
deg.
3.1.34(cid:9) Such a large movement(cid:9) Noted
of the THS LE
downwards caused the
Violent pitch up to

Indian Oil bowser refuelled the aircraft after carrying out
a fuel sampling check. The aircraft was refuelled with 600
lbs. as the arrival fuel figure was 1000 lbs. Three
passengers namely Shri Raju Samala, Shri Sasikant Ramani
and Mrs. Vijaya Kalyani checked in at Kochi aerodrome for
Thiruvananthapuram. There was only one piece of checked-in-
baggage. The load and trim sheet was computed by Mrs.
Achamma Jacob, Senior Traffic Assistant on duty, and was
signed by Capt. S.R. Singh. Preflight inspection schedule
was carried out by Shri M. Vijayakumar, Sr. Aircraft
Technician and was countersigned by Capt. S.R. Singh. On

seat when the aircraft taxied out from the tarmac.
1.1.2(cid:9) At 0527 UTC, IC-503 requested Kochi ATC for start
up clearance as per the ATC tape transcript (Exhibit
No.01). ATC approved the start up and passed temperature
4

27, QNH 1009 and informed IC-503 that level clearance was
awaited. At 0530 UTC, IC-503 contacted ATC and stated that
IC-503 was ready for taxi. ATC cleared IC-503 for taxi via
link for RWY 17. At 0531 UTC, IC-503 requested ATC to
enter, back track and line up for RWY 17 to which ATC asked
the aircraft to standby. AT 053130 UTC, ATC again informed
IC-503 to remain on standby to enter RWY as level clearance
was still awaited. At 053149 UTC, ATC cleared IC-503 to
line up and hold as level clearance had still not been
received. At 053336 UTC, ATC requested IC-503 to contact
Thiruvananthapuram, as they were unable to establish
contact. IC-503 informed ATC that they would do so at 3000'
after take off to which ATC asked the aircraft to standby
as at that very moment contact had been established with
Thiruvananthapuram. At 053356 UTC, ATC cleared IC-503 to
Thiruvananthapuram via flight planned route to cruise and
maintain flight level 95, after departure from RWY 17, to
climb straight ahead to 1000', turn left, and then climb on
track. The clearance was read back by IC-503. At 0534 UTC,
ATC instructed IC-503 to be on standby for take off
as they
were firing a cartridge to scare away a bird on the
runway.
At 053413 UTC, IC-503 was cleared for take off by
the ATC
after passing winds as 250/08 kts. There were no
further
transmissions between IC-503 and Kochi ATC.
1.1.3 Sub Lieutenant Darshan Lal who was one of the two
duty air traffic controllers (DATCO) on duty at the tower
stated that (Exhibit No.02) the look out on duty had
reported to him that IC-503 was climbi ng very steeply on
the take off path. He had moved forward from where he was
standing and established visual contact with the aircraft.
At that time, the aircraft was about 600' above ground
level (AGL) having pitched up past the vertical, with the
5

(cid:9)(cid:9)
nose having turned to the right through more than 90°. It
had banked between 90°-120° to the right and the nose was
just below the horizon. Thereafter the nose of the aircraft
continued to drop and the aircraft rolled to the left to
almost wings level attitude. By that time the aircraft nose
had dropped sharply and the aircraft crashed on the roof of
the CRS building at the NAY(K). He had viewed the aircraft
through the glass panes of two frames measuring about 6' in
width at the Control Tower.
1.1.4(cid:9) Sub Lieutenant Rashmi Singh who was on duty at
the tower as DATCO stated that (Exhibit No.03) when the
aircraft had gained a height of approx. 500' after take
off, the aircraft had gone out of her line of sight. The
look-out on duty had reported that IC-503 was performing a
loop and within a few seconds she saw the aircraft crashing
on one of the buildings of NAY(K).
1.1.5(cid:9) The look-out on duty at the tower, Leading Air
Handler J.S. Biswas stated that (Exhibit No.04) the
aircraft had gained height normally after take off till
about 400'. The aircraft had then suddenly pitched up till
it had become almost vertical. He had reported the same to
the DATCO. Another look-out, Naval Air Handler R.K.
Tripathi, who was on duty at the tower stated that (Exhibit
No.05) the take off had been normal upto approx. 600'
height. After that he had seen the aircraft pitch up
sharply to approx. 90° attitude and then become inverted.
Thereafter the aircraft had entered a dive. While diving it
had rolled to the wings level position. The dive was quite
steep and before impact, the aircraft had appeared to yaw
slightly to the left and right.

1.1.6(cid:9)
Lt. Vikram Mahajan, an eyewitness stated that
(Exhibit No.06) he was going to attend a squadron briefing,
when he had seen an Indian Airlines Dornier emerge from
behind the Flight and Tactical Simulator(FATS) building in
a vertical attitude, eventually becoming inverted and then
diving steeply, thereby appearing to complete a loop. He
had not seen where it had crashed and in what attitude as
it had been obscured by the FATS building. When inverted,
it was facing North. The aircraft was visible to him for
barely five to six seconds. Throughout this duration, both
engines appeared to be operating normally.
1.1.7(cid:9)
Dy. Commandant T. Anil Kumar, an eyewitness
stated that (Exhibit No.07) while walking towards the FATS
building with his colleagues, he had seen a Dornier
aircraft climbing vertically along the take off path of RWY
17, at a height of about 500'. From the vertical attitude,
the aircraft had become inverted. At the end of the
inverted phase, the nose had dropped and the aircraft had
dived in a steep nose down attitude rolling to right. The
aircraft wing was facing away from his position. The
maneouvre was a half loop. The aircraft while carrying
out
the maneouvre had moved to the right from its initial
position and had lost height simultaneously and was then
obscured. During inverted flight, the aircraft had
maintained a level attitude, horizontal to the ground and
at no stage had the aircraft lost height in that phase of
flight.
1.1.8(cid:9)
Lt. Cdr. Bhuri Singh, SATCO on duty stated that
(Exhibit No.08) Indian Airlines Dornier 228 aircraft IC-503
had taken off from RWY 17 at about 0534 UTC and immediately
after attaining a certain height, the aircraft was seen
7

(cid:9)(cid:9)
performing an unusual maneuver by the personnel on duty at
the ATC and the personnel on duty at the ATC garage. On
seeing this, the Crash Fire Tender (CFT) crew manning the
CFTs in the garage had driven their vehicles towards the
runway entry point. The aircraft was then seen diving
towards the west of RWY 17/35 and crashing on top of a
NAY(K) building. By then the DATCO had sounded the crash
siren and two CFTs had already crossed the runway and
proceeded towards the NAY(K) complex. Both CFTs of the ATC
had reached the crash site and commenced fire fighting by
about 0536 UTC.
1.1.9(cid:9) The aircraft had caught fire immediately after
impact with the roof of the CRS building. The nose of the
aircraft was entangled with the steel girders of the roof,
half inside an Air Conditioned (AC) room and the tail was
on top of the roof approx. 30 feet in the air. The crash
crew were directed to break the AC windows and the side
delivery hoses were taken inside to fight the fire from
underneath the nose. The two CFTs and one Domestic Fire
Tender (DFT) of Garuda had fought the fire from the top
with main monitors and from the bottom with side delivery
hoses. In the mean time three fire tenders from INS
Venduruthy had also been deployed to fight the aircraft
fire and also to replenish the water of the main CFTs.
1.1.10(cid:9) The ATC had requisitioned the services of three
DFTs from INS VENDURUTHY fire station, three DFTs from the
Port Trust Fire station, one from the Kochi Ship Yard, two
from the Kerala Fire Force, Gandhinagar, one from the
Kerala Fire Force, Club road, two from the Kerala Fire
Force, Mattancherry and ten ambulances from various
hospitals. The fire was completely extinguished by 0555 UTC
8

(cid:9)(cid:9)
by using ATC CFTs and Garuda/Venduruthy DFTs for fire
fighting/replenishment of water in the CFTs.(cid:9)
During the
fire fighting a total of 2000 liters of foam compound were
used to completely extinguish the fire on the aircraft and
inside the room.
1.1.11(cid:9)
Rescue personnel wearing fire proximity suits
could not gain entry into the aircraft wreckage since it
was engulfed in flames when they had arrived on the scene.
The wreckage was also disintegrating. As soon as the fire
Was brought under control, one crew member was removed by
the rescue team without disturbing the wreckage. He was
declared dead on arrival at the hospital. Removal of other
personnel was difficult due to the position of the crashed
aircraft inside the room of CRS with the tail sticking
above the roof. The walls and roof of the building were
also giving way. The major portion of the fuselage had
compressed on impact and was enmeshed in the steel girders
of the roof. The wreckage was suspended in the air with all
bodies trapped inside.
1.1.12(cid:9)
The crash and salvage teams had used a crane and
slings to lift the tail portion of the wreckage and place
it on the roof. Part by part the wreckage was slung and
lifted by the crane to free the remaining bodies. It had
taken approx. 4% hours to recover the last body from the
wreckage.
1.1.13(cid:9)
All six persons on board IC-503 died in this
accident. Two persons namely Shri K.G. Thomas and Shri
Chandrasekharan, who were working in the hangar, also died.
Another person Shri A. Radhakrishnan received serious
9

injuries and succumbed to his injuries on 7.8.98.(cid:9) Six
other persons received minor injuries.

1.6 Aircraft Information
1.6.1(cid:9) Dornier 228-201 aircraft VT-EJW was manufactured
by HAL, Kanpur in 1986. The aircraft had S/N HAL-
K/D0228/1006. It was initially issued with a Certificate of
12

Airworthiness (C of A) No.1799 on 20.6.86 under Normal
category and sub-division Passenger machine. The maximum
all up weight authorised was 5980 kgs. It was earlier
maintained by erstwhile Vayudoot Ltd. The aircraft was
grounded on 6.3.93 for 1800 hrs/one year inspection and the
C. of A of the aircraft had expired on 10.11.93. In 1994
there was a merger of Vayudoot Ltd with Indian Airlines and
the Short Haul Operations Department (SHOD) was formed. In
March 1997 SHOD took up the matter with Director of
Airworthiness (DAW), DGCA, Delhi Region to resume
operations with VT-EJW as a part of their programme to
utilise their Dornier 228 fleet and submitted the following
quantum of work for approval for the purpose of C. of A
renewal.
a)
Thorough cleaning, inspection and corrosion prevention
of the aircraft.
b)
4800 flight hours (FH) and 8 Year inspection schedules
(These were the highest Maintenance Schedules on the
aircraft).
c) All applicable SSIs.
d)
Compliance of all mandatory modifications, inspections
and Service Bulletins.
e) Installation of all serviceable lifed components and
accessories.
f) Installation of ATC Transponder.
g) Installation of Flight Data Recorder.
13

h) Installation of overhauled/serviceable engines.
j) Installation of overhauled/serviceable propellers.
k) Painting of aircraft.
1) Weighing of the aircraft.
m) Any other work required to comply the findings of the
technical audit of M/s Dornier who had carried out detailed
inspection of the Dornier 228 fleet of SHOD.
1.6.2(cid:9) During the 4800 FH/8 year inspection schedule,
the Trimmable Horizontal Stabilizer (THS) actuator
attachment bearing support fitting was removed. It was sent
for Eddy Current Inspection (ECI). The fitting failed to
pass the ECI. Since no new fitting was available in the
stores, a fitting of the same part no. was removed from
another Dornier aircraft VT-EJU and installed on VT-EJW
after it had passed the ECI.
1.6.3 On completion of the above quantum of work and C of
A test flight on 14.4.98, C. of A was renewed on 27.4.98
for one year. At the time of C. of A renewal, the aircraft
had done 13289:20 hrs since manufacture. It was registered
with IA on 12.6.97 vide C. of R No.2279/3. It was fitted
with Garrett TPE-331-5-252D engines (Left Engine S/N H58004
and right engine S/N H58014). On 6.5.98 left engine S/N
H58004 was removed due suspected engine malfunction and
overhauled engine S/N P39108 was fitted. The aircraft was
fitted with constant speed reversible Hartzell propellers
S/N CD 1710 on the left and S/N CD 2096 on the right.

1.6.7(cid:9) A list of snags reported and the rectification work
done after the C of A renewal on 27.4.98, is at Exhibit
No.10.
1.6.8 At the time of take off, the aircraft had an All Up
Weight (AUW) of 4892 Kg against authorized max. take-off
weight (MTOW) of 5980 kg. and the CG was 27.45%, which was
within limits.
1.6.9 The primary flight controls consisted of ailerons,
elevators and rudder and were operated manually from dual
cockpit controls. Secondary flight controls consisted of
electrically operated fowler flaps. ,The ailerons were
linked to the flaps in such a way that they drooped
16

progressively as the flaps were extended. The ailerons were
trimmed electrically, the rudder was trimmed manually and
pitch trim was achieved by moving the complete horizontal
stabilizer electrically. The positions of all three trimmed
surfaces were indicated on a combined trim position
indicator (Refer Annexure 1).
1.6.10 A stall warning system gave an audio-visual
indication of the onset of a stall condition. A discrete
signal from the lift computer illuminated the STALL warning
lamp and sounded a stall warning horn if the airplane speed
deviated into deep SLOW range. A press-to-test facility was
_incorporated into the STALL warning lamp to test the
serviceability of the system.
1.6.11(cid:9) The aircraft was trimmed about the pitch axis by
an electrical actuator, which moved the complete horizontal
stabilizer. The actuator was controlled by paired pitch
trim switches on each control wheel. Movement of the
actuator was limited by internal limit switches. The
airplane VT-EJW was fitted with an autopilot. The
stabilizer actuator could also be controlled by the
vertical trim switch on the flight director mode
controller. This switch allowed the pilot to trim the
airplane about the pitch axis without disturbing the
selected flight director mode or disengaging the autopilot.
Aircraft VT-EJW was fitted with a single shaft THS
actuator. Actuator in fully extended position corresponded
to THS leading edge (LE) full down position and actuator in
fully retracted position corresponded to THS LE full up
position. Apart from actuator bottoming at the end of
travel in the extended or retracted positions, there were
17

no other mechanical stops to prevent THS movement in either
direction.
1.6.12(cid:9)
A Fowler type flap was fitted to each wing
inboard of the aileron. Both flaps were driven by a single
electrical central drive unit via flexible shafts and screw
jack type flap actuators. Flap position was selected by the
flap selector switch and controlled by the flap control
unit mounted on the central drive unit. The central drive
unit consisted of a reversible DC motor equipped with an
electromagnetic brake . The motor drive was taken out via an
overload clutch and reduction gearbox. Torque limiters
protected the flexible shafts and flap actuators against
overloading. An asymmetry control unit was fitted on the
outboard ends of the left and right flap outer drive
shafts. These two asymmetry units compared the positions of
the left and right flaps and provided a fail-safe circuit
to stop the flaps when an asymmetrical movement was
detected.

1.11 Flight Recorders :
1.11.1 Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR)
1.11.1.1 Dornier aircraft VT-EJW was fitted with a CVR
manufactured by the Electronic Corporation of India Ltd.
(ECIL). It was a MRU 101 model, Sl.no 0123. The unit was
retrieved from the wreckage in a burnt condition. It was
then dismantled at the facilities of the DGCA office,
Delhi. The spool tape was releised from the deck. The tape
was then transported to a new spool with lead tapes
attached to both the ends. Play back of the CVR was done on
a spool type, four channel, instrumentation recorder and
all the information on all four channels was transferred to
a Digital Audio Tape Recorder (DAT).
1.11.1.2(cid:9) The relevant tape transcript was prepared from
the time the aircraft was cleared for take-off till the
20

(cid:9)(cid:9)
aircraft crashed. It was of about 1 .nt. 07 sec. duration.
The tape transcript is at Exhibit No.12.
1.11.1.3(cid:9) Replay of the CVR revealed that after the
aircraft was cleared for take-off, the crew carried out
before take off check lists and during the take off there
were call outs of '80 kts.', 'Vi', 'Rotate' and 'Positive
rate'. No abnormality in the voices was detected till the
'positive rate' call out, which was given 40 seconds after
the aircraft was cleared for take-off. Six seconds after
the 'Positive rate' call out, there was an exclamation of
"WHO GAYA AA GAYA" followed by aural warning (1.037Khz)
which stopped after 2 seconds. On•e of the crew had then
said 'Everything checked'. Thereafter there were abnormal
sounds in the cockpit probably of the headset microphone
getting mechanically disturbed. Another aural warning
(1.025Khz) appeared 11 seconds before impact followed by an
exclamation of "HARE RAM HARE RAM" by the Pilot-in-Command.
Nine seconds prior to impact, sudden change in engine noise
(drop in intensity of pitch of engine noise) was noticed
which continued till impact. Aural warning (1.025 Khz),
which had sounded earlier, stopped two seconds prior to
impact. The Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) sounded
a 'Too Low Pull Up' warning just before impact. Only "Too
Low" was recorded as the aircraft crashed before the full
warning was completed.
1.11.1.4(cid:9) To detect the propeller RPM during the course of
rotation and initial phase of climb of the aircraft, sound
spectrum analysis was carried out at the facilities of DGCA
office, Delhi (Exhibit No.13). Sound spectrum analysis
revealed that while the RPM remained more or less between
90 to 100% upto -9 seconds before the crash, there was a
21

noticeable drop in its pitch from -8 to -3 seconds prior to
crash. Upto -8 seconds prior to crash, the RPM remained
within the required level. For the last 8 seconds, RPM
evaluation could not be done as Blade Passing Frequency
features could not be seen during the analysis.
1.11.2 Digital Flight Recorder (DFR) :
1.11.2.1(cid:9) The aircraft was fitted with a Loral DFR, model
F-800 having S/N 00684 U and part no.17M-900-274. It was
manufactured by M/s L3 communication, Aviation recorders,
USA in 1988 and was procured by Indian Airlines in April
1998. It was fitted on VT-EJW on 30.6.98 at Agati and had
done about 90 hrs since installation till the date of
accident. It was recovered from the wreckage without any
fire damage. The recorder was sent to M/s VSM Aerospace,
Bangalore for decoding the accident data and their report
is Exhibit No.14. After dismantling the DFR, the recording
capsule was removed and installed on a serviceable DFR. The
unit was then run for nearly four hrs. However no useful
data could be obtained. The recording capsule was then
installed back on the accident DFR. A sample check of data
on various tracks revealed that in each track some data on
altitude, heading and 'g' trace were available with time,
which was coupled with a large number of bad frames. The
airspeed data appeared to be totally corrupt. In view of
the above observation, 24 hrs. data dumping was performed
in the 'read mode only' from the recording capsule of the
accident DFR.
1.11.2.2 It was observed that recording capsule of the
accident DFR had no relevant data recorded in it all
through 24 hrs. There was a cyclic pattern between the bad
22

(cid:9)(cid:9)
and partially good/good data over the 24 hrs. block. There
was a spring valve blockage in the pitct and static input
socket of the accident DFR. The blockage was due to a bent
spring valve found in both the ports, which obstructed the
airflow.
1.12 Wreckage and Impact Information :
1.12.1(cid:9) The aircraft crashed on a heading of 290° on the
roof of the CRS of the NAY(K) located at a distance of
about 700' to the right of RWY 17. The sides of the CRS
building had high buttresses approx. 7-8 ft: higher than
the highest point of the roof. The aircraft caught fire
after impact with the CRS building and the entire wreckage
was confined at one location only in the building. There
was no damage to the trees and buildings. surrounding the
CRS building. The final position of the aircraft wreckage
indicated that the aircraft had nose dived into the CRS
building at an angle of about 20°. The tail portion of the
aircraft was up in the air on top of the roof at a height
of about 30' (Refer Photograph 1). The sketch showing the
crash site is at Annexure 2.

lower portion of the fuselage between Frames 18-19 where
the landing gear was mounted was recovered. The upper half
of the section was found sheared off, Frames 18-19 were
badly crushed and burnt and were hanging entangled in the
roof structure. The main landing gear area of the fuselage
was also recovered from the roof in a totally burnt
condition. The left gear was fully retracted but the right
gear showed partial extension. However there was no sign of
fire on the extended portion Jf the right gear actuator
indicating that the gear had partially extended during the
process of removal of the wreckage. The hydraulic power
pack and its associated components mounted between Frame 19
and 21 were found in the wreckage. These were broken and
burnt. Air-conditioning equipment between Frames 15 and 16
was damaged and found burnt. All accessories/components in
the Frames between 22-25 were damaged and burnt.
1.12.4(cid:9) Examination of the wing section covering Frames
16-19A revealed that the left wing was in one piece and had
broken off from the fuselage. It showed signs of fire
towards the root end. Both the attachment bolts of the wing
were found secured and safetied. Aileron control rods were
found broken. Wing tip was found secured and intact. The
24

(cid:9)(cid:9)

fairing was found secured. Only the outer portion of flap
was found which had signs of burning. Flap linkage's were
found broken. Asymmetry control unit alongwith its
electrical connection was found secured to the rear spar.
Examination of flaps and screw jacks revealed that the
flaps were in the extended position '1' (5° position).
Examination of screw jacks showed that the outboard screw
jack had 21 visible threads and the inboard had 19 visible
threads Inboard half of the wing had burn marks. Front
portion of the feeder tank was found crushed. Mid-section
of the front spar had less damage, whereas the outboard
side of the front spar was found crushed. The engine was
found uprooted from its mounting alongwith cowlings.
1.12.5(cid:9) The right wing was found in a severely damaged
state. The wing tip was broken. An outer portion of the
wing was resting on a table in the room adjacent to the
corridor. The flap had separated from the wing and was
entangled in the roof structure. Examination of the screw
jacks showed that the outboard as well as inboard screw
jacks had 21 threads visible. Root end portion of the wing
containing the feeder tank was found crushed and burnt.
Engine was found uprooted from its mounting.
1.12.6(cid:9) The tail portion of the aircraft, which had been
lifted and placed on the roof while recovering the trapped
bodies, was examined. The examination revealed that the
tail portion including the vertical fin/rudder, horizontal
stabilizer and elevator were intact. The elevator was found
with no apparent external damage and properly secured. The
tail cone was removed to gain access to the Trimmable
25

(cid:9)(cid:9)
Horizontal Stabilizer (THS) actuator. The actuator was
found attached to the bearing support fitting at the
fuselage end and the THS at the other. The electrital
connections were intact. The trim actuator was found in the
retracted condition indicating that the stabilizer had been
trimmed to the full aircraft nose down position. However
the bearing support fitting connecting THS actuator to the
fuselage bulkhead at Frame 34 was found partially detached.
(Refer Photograph 3). Linkages of elevator control were
found in position from the rear upto the passenger entry
door.
1.12.7(cid:9) There was no sign of damage to THS actuator, its
end fitting bolts and attachment points (Refer Photograph
4). Near Frame 34, the fuselage skin had a slight bulge and
a crack on the LHS at stringer 7 level (Refer Photograph
5). On the RHS at the same level, two rivets were found
sheared off and two rivets were found partially pulled
inward (Refer Photograph 6). Bulkhead at Frames from #30-
#33 had no visual damage in the form of buckling, cracks,
or pulled rivets or any other deformation. During
inspection through LHS access panel, the bearing support
fitting and its attachment to the fuselage brackets showed
that 10 hi-lok fasteners were not installed (Refer
Photograph 7). All the ten holes were clear and there was
no visible distortion of the holes on the longitudinal
brackets. Inside the rear fuselage shell, there was no sign
of any sheared hi-lok fastener or collar.
1.12.8(cid:9) The rudder was found attached to the fin and free
to move. There was no apparent damage to the rudder trim,
which was found trimmed to the right, approximately 1%
inches, from the neutral position.
26

(cid:9)(cid:9)
1.12.9 For further examination of the THS actuator
forward attachment bearing support fitting on Frame 34
bulkhead, the elevator, horizontal stabilizer and rudder
were removed and the vertical fin was de-riveted from the
tail section. Later on, the aft portion of the fuselage,
containing Frames # 32, 33 and 34, was cut from the
fuselage tail section and sent to the National Aerospace
Laboratories (NAL), Bangalore, for further examination.
1.12.10(cid:9) The THS actuator was sent to HAL Kanpur, for a
functional check.
1.12.11 The left engine was in a damaged state. The yoke
assembly had separated from its fittings and all fitting
points had broken. Examination of the engine in-situ
revealed no signs of burning. However sand and bricks
pieces were found embedded in the engine components.
Propeller Pitch Control (PPC) Unit mountings were found
loose and reading on the PPC could not be ascertained since
it was found free to rotate. Gear Box Section was found to
be in good shape. However the mounting points of the yoke
assembly on the gear box were damaged. The oil cooler and
generator had detached from the engine. Shaft collar for
propeller mounting was broken. Air intake was damaged and
the impeller blades were not visible. Fuel Control Unit
(FCU) mounting studs had detached from the engine. All
control linkage rods on FCU, propeller pitch control unit
and propeller governor were damaged. The visible turbine
blades were normal.
1.12.12(cid:9) The right engine was burnt and damaged.
Examination of the engine in situ revealed that both the
attachment brackets had broken and twisted. No signs of
27

distortion could be seen on the visible turbine blades. The
components of the fuel systems were found in place. Fuel
Control Unit mounting studs were found adrift from the gear
box. Shaft Collar of the propeller mounting had broken. Air
intake was damaged. Gear Box section and plenum chamber
were found in place. The dial indicator on the PPC showed a
reading of 80%. All drain pipes were bent and distorted and
all electrical connections were burnt.
1.12.13 Both engines were sent to HAL, Bangalore for
strip examination.
1.12.14 Examination of left propeller in situ revealed
that three blades had sheared off at the tips. The leading
edges of all the four blades bore tearing/shearing marks.
The blades were found bent in different directions. The
piston, cylinder, pitch change rod and spring were found
detached from the propeller assy. The start locks were
found to be off the locks. All propeller blades were off
their respective creep marks. However, the extent of shift
was different for different blades.
1.12.15 Examination of the right propeller in-situ
revealed that one blade was broken and leading edges of all
the four blades had cut marks. The blades were found bent
in different directions. The spinner was found damaged. All
propeller blades were found off their respective creep
marks. However extent of shift was different for different
blades. The start locks were found to be off the locks.
1.12.16 Both propellers were sent to HAL, Kanpur for
further examination.

1.13
Medical and Pathological Information :
1.13.1(cid:9) Surg. Lt. Cdr. S.S. Khanuja, who was on duty at
the Medical Inspection (MI) room of INS Garuda, on the date
of accident stated that (Exhibit No.15) at about 0535 UTC
he heard a distinct soft thud followed by three short
sirens.(cid:9) The Medical department at that time was fully
manned. In the next 20-30 seconds, ATC ambulance arrived
at the MI room and the driver informed him that a civilian
aircraft had crashed on the opposite side of the runway. He
immediately rushed to the crash site in the ambulance along
with two medical assistants. All equipment for providing
medical aid was already available in the ambulance. His
Colleague Surg. Cdr. P.R. Nair remained behind to initiate
immediate measures to inform all concerned organizations,
specifically Indian Navy hospital Sanjivini about the
crash.
1.13.2(cid:9) Surg. Lt. Cdr. Khanuja said that on reaching the
accident site, a medical post was established just near the
CRS building. The fire fighting team informed him that one
severely burnt individual had been taken in a vehicle to
the hospital. There were others who had very minimal
injuries and who had been taken to MI room Garuda for
first-aid. Surg. Lt. Cdr. Khanuja had positioned himself
in front of the building where the main fire fighting
operations were being carried out. In the meantime he was
joined by Surg. Cdr. P.R. Nair. Immediately after the fire
was brought under control, one dead body was found and
removed from inside the building. He said that around 0605
UTC, one crash victim was removed from the aircraft. He
examined the body and found all vital signs absent and the
victim was dead. The body had a severe scalp injury about
29

12-15 cms. long and one leg was at an angle, which
indicated both bones in the leg had broken. The body was
also severely burnt. Five to ten minutes later another body
was removed. This body was burnt beyond recognition and
was in a pugilistic attitude. It appeared to him to be the
body of one of the workers in the building at the time of
the crash.
1.13.3 When the crane dragged the rear portion of the
aircraft on to the undamaged portion of the roof of the
building, he saw a part of the body of another victim from
the roof. The body was not recognizable and extensively
burnt.(cid:9)
There were no vital signs of life. It was not
possible to remove the body from that position. Thereafter
attempts were made to remove the wreckage with the help of
a crane. The combined efforts resulted in five more bodies
falling from the aircraft wreckage on to the corridor. All
the bodies were mutilated with various body parts missing.
Two of the bodies were decapitated. One body from its
features appeared to be that of a woman. All the bodies
were put on a stretcher, covered by a bed sheet and removed
in ambulances to the Medical Trust Hospital. The last body
was recovered at about 0900 UTC. He alongwith Surg. Cdr.
P.R. Nair, and the medical staff left the crash site at
around 0930 UTC.
1.13.4(cid:9)
Surg. Cdr. P.R. Nair stated that (Exhibit No.16)
at about 0535 UTC while he was attending to his duties at
MI room of INS Garuda, he heard the crash siren being
sounded followed by a telephone message that a civil
aircraft had crashed adjacent to the runway near NAY(K).
His colleague, Surg. Lt. Cdr. S.S. Khanuja left immediately
in the crash ambulance with a medical team. Thereafter, he
30

informed the Indian Naval Hospital (INH) Sanjivani to keep
all Medical Officers on standby to assist/receive
casualties.(cid:9)
He also instructed the reception Medical
Assistant in the MI Room to inform the Civil hospitals viz.
Medical Trust Hospital, Ernakulam General Hospital, to
activate their crash and rescue services. Then he left for
the crash site and joined the medical team. They informed
him that a few casualties have already been sent to the INH
Sanjivani. At about 0605 UTC, a charred lifeless body was
removed from the room on whose roof the aircraft had
crashed followed by a similar body soon after. In the
meanwhile ambulances and medical teams from various
hospitals of Kochi had arrived. The two charred bodies were
placed in the ambulance and sent to the hospital.
Thereafter on inquiring from the MI Room, he was informed
that three cases with minor injuries had been received. He
instructed that they should be sent to INH Sanjivani.
Thereafter he spoke to Surg. Cdr. Ratna Mahendra at INH
Sanjivani to gather details of casualties already received.
She informed him that one was brought in dead and was
removed to the mortuary. One Petty Officer Radhakrishnan
had suffered 85% burns and was admitted in the Intensive
Care Unit (ICU) and placed on the Dangerously Ill List
(DIL). A few others had sustained minor injuries and had
been admitted for observation.
1.13.5(cid:9) Surg. Cdr. Ratna Mahendra stated that (Exhibit
No.17) the first casualty to arrive was Petty Officer
Radhakrishnan, who was conscious and had 85% burns.
Emergency first aid, including removal of burnt clothing,
administration of oxygen, establishment of an intravenous
line and Inj. morphine IV, was given and he was transferred
to the ICU for further management by the Surgical
31

Specialist. Three persons, who had superficial injuries,
were brought to the MI Room at 0600 UTC, given first aid
and later admitted to the hospital for observation. At 0610
UTC, S. Sajid, Indian Airlines employee, was brought to the
MI Room. On arrival it was observed there were no signs of
life. The individual did not respond to any stimuli, there
were no heart sounds or respiratory effort, blood pressure
was not recordable and both pupils were dilated and fixed.
His clothing was partially burnt. He had extensive burns
(100%), surgical emphysema over face, chest, upper arm, A
15 cm long full thickness laceration of the scalp,
extending between the two temporoparietal regions and
compound fracture right tibia/fibula. Despite the above,
resuscitative measures were instituted and continued for 30
minutes to give the individual the maximum benefit of a
chance to recover. This included establishment of the
airway, administration of oxy-,en
through an endotracheal
tube, intravenous lifeline and continuous cardio-pulmonary
resuscitation. Inj. Adrenaline was given intravenously and
intra-cardiac. 320 Joules DC shock was given twice.
However, not withstanding the efforts made, the individual
could not be resuscitated and was declared "BROUGHT IN
DEAD" at 0610 UTC.
1.13.6(cid:9)
In all, nine persons died in the accident. These
were the three crew members, three passengers on board and
three persons on the ground. Autopsy of all the bodies was
carried out. Histopathological examination and bio-chemical
toxicological examination in respect of bodies of Capt.
S.R. Singh and Capt. Manish Sharma were also carried out.
32

(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)
1.13.7(cid:9)
Capt. S.R. Singh's body was found decapitated.
The burns and other injuries were equally sufficient to
cause death. The Post-mortem report is at Exhibit No.18.
1.13.8 Histopathological examination of Capt. S.R.
Singh's viscera had revealed (Exhibit No.19) that most of
the organs showed autolytic changes. Changes in lungs and
heart were consistent with traumatic origin. Burns were
post-mortem. There was no evidence of any pre-existing
disease. Alcohol was not found in his blood sample. Carbon
mono-oxide levels were not raised and lactic acid was
within normal limits, indicating no evidence of hypoxia.
1.13.9(cid:9) Capt. Manish Sharma's body was found decapitated.
The burns and other injuries were equally sufficient to
cause death. The Post-mortem report is at Exhibit No.20.
1.13.10 Histopathological examination of Capt. Manish
Sharma's viscera revealed (Exhibit No.21) that most of the
organs showed autolytic changes. Changes in lungs and heart
were consistent with traumatic origin. Burns were post-
mortem. There was no evidence of any pre-existing disease.
Alcohol was not found in his blood sample. Carbon mono-
oxide levels were not raised and lactic acid was within
normal limits, indicating no evidence of hypoxia.
1.13.11 The autopsy of Shri S. Sajid, Flight Purser,
revealed (Exhibit No.22) the cause of death to be burns and
multiple injuries specially that of the cervical vertebra.
1.13.12(cid:9) The autopsy of the passengers revealed that the
cause of death of Shri Raju Samala was due to severe burns
involving the entire body (Exhibit No.23) and that of Sh.
33

(cid:9)(cid:9)
Sasikant Ramani was due to injury to the skull and burns
(Exhibit No.24) and that of Mrs. Vijayakalyani was due to
multiple injuries especially head injury and burns (Exhibit
No.25).
1.13.13 Autopsy of the three persons who died on the
ground revealed that the cause of death of Shri K.G. Thomas
and Shri Chandrashekharan was due to severe burns (Exhibit
No.26). The autopsy of Sh. Radhakrishnan, who had received
85% burns during the accident on 30.7.98 and died on
7.8.98, revealed that the cause of death was due to burns
(Exhibit No.27).
1.13.14(cid:9) Six other persons on ground had received minor
injuries and were discharged later on.
1.14 Fire :
1.14.1(cid:9) The aircraft was destroyed due post impact fire.
There was no inflight fire, which was evident from the fact
that there was no fire damage to the empennage portion of
the aircraft when it had nose-dived and impacted the CRS
building.
1.14.2(cid:9) The aircraft had 1600 lbs. fuel on board when it
taxied out at 0527 UTC. It took off at 053413 UTC and
crashed after about one minute. It caught fire immediately
after the impact with the CRS building. Safety services had
reached the site of accident within a minute of the crash.
The fire was completely extinguished within 25 minutes by
using ATC CFTs and Garuda/Venduruthy DFTs. ATC had also
requisitioned the services of 12 fire vehicles from six
different fire stations. During the fire fighting, a total
34

of 2000 liters of foam compound was use. to completely
extinguish the fire on the aircraft as well as inside the
building.
1.15 Survival Aspects :
1.15.1(cid:9) The accident was not survivable. The aircraft had
caught fire immediately after impact with the CRS building.
The impact was so severe that the bodies of the two pilots
were found decapitated. Autopsy of four more persons on
board the aircraft indicated that their deaths were due to
injuries and severe burns.
1.16 Tests and Research :
1.16.1 Strip Examination of the Engines :
1.16.1.1 Both engines were strip examined at the facilities
of HAL, Engine Division, Bangalore. The strip examination
report is at Exhibit No.28.
1.16.1.2 The pre-strip survey as well as the strip
examination indicated considerable burning of the right
(cid:9)
engine and extensive damage to both engines. Critical
examination of the damaged components indicated that the
damage was all post impact and there had been no failure of
any component or system which could have caused
malfunctioning of any engine, resulting in reduction or
loss of power.
1.16.1.3 The report stated that the type of failure of the
torsion shaft of both engines proved that the engines were
developing power at the time of impact. The shafts had
35

failed at the same location and due to the same reason of
high torsional load. The shafts experienced very high
torsional load due to sudden stoppage of the propellers on
impact.
1.16.1.4 All damage observed on the engine internally and
externally was caused by impact. There was no evidence of
any failure or malfunction of any component or system. It
was confirmed that both engines were developing power at
the time of impact.
1.16.2
Examination of Propellers :
1.16.2.1 Both propellers were examined in detail at HAL,
Kanpur. The examination report is at Exhibit No.29.
1.16.2.2 Examination revealed that on the right propeller,
one blade was broken and leading edges of all the four
blades had cut marks. Besides, the blades had slipped
within the clamps as was indicated by the shift in the
position of the red alignment marks". This led to the
conclusion that the propeller was rotating at the time of
impact. The force of rotation was adequate to cause
shearing/tearing of the blade, which meant the propeller
was rotating at high RPM under power. Thus it could be
concluded that power was being developed at the time of
impact.
1.16.2.3 On the left propeller, three blades tips had
sheared off. The leading edges of all the four blades bore
tearing/shearing marks. It could be concluded that the
left propeller was rotating under power at high RPM and
36

(cid:9)
eN
that the left engine was developing power at the time of
t"-(cid:9)
impact. Slippage of the blades within the clamps was non-
uniform. The non-uniform slippage could have occurred due
to impact. Thus it could be concluded that power was being
developed at the time of impact.
1.16.2.4 The feathering spring assembly consisting of pitch
change rod and the piston was found broken. This led to
loss of oil. Loss of oil in the pitch change mechanism
made the propeller blades move to the 'feather' position.
1.16.2.5 This also led to the conclusion that the
propeller system was functioning properly before impact.
1.16.2.6 Further distortion of shape of the blades occurred
during final settling. down of the aircraft causing impact
damages yet again. Thus the secondary impact damage with
stationary or low speed propellers distorted the pattern of
damage of the propellers which had occurred during the
initial impact.
1.16.2.7 In the Flight Mode, RPM was always maintained
between 96-100% and to change from 'Flight Mode' to 'Ground
Operating Mode', the power lever of the engine had to be
lifted up and brought back. Chances of such an inadvertent
operation by the pilot were remote.
1.16.2.8 Considering the above and observations made in
the preceding paragraphs, it was concluded that the
propellers were in the Flight Mode of 96-100% RPM.
37

1.16.3 Examination of the Installation of THS Actuator
Forward Attachment Bearing Support Fitting on
Frame 34 Bulkhead :
1.16.3.1 Installation of the THS actuator forward
attachment bearing support fitting on Frame 34 bulkhead was
examined at the facilities of NAL, Bangalore.(cid:9) The
examination report is at Exhibit No.30.
1.16.3.2 The bearing support fitting had a vertical flange
which was attached to the web of Frame 34 bulkhead using
four hi-lok fasteners at the corners and quantity five each
'D' rivets on the left and right vertical sides
respectively (Refer Photograph 8). It also had a
longitudinal tang at the forward side, which was sandwiched
between two brackets (Refer Photograph 9) and held by means
of qty. 10 hi-lok fasteners.
1.16.3.3 Examination revealed that the fitting had moved
out of the plane of Frame 34 with clear evidence of
structural damage. The structural damage consisted of
fracture of the thin aluminum alloy web to which the
fitting was attached originating from the rivet holes on
the right hand vertical side extending across the lower
edge of the fitting to the left hand side (Refer Photograph
9). However the fitting remained attached to the bulkhead
web at the upper edge with qty. two hi-lok fasteners at the
top left and right corners. This made the forward lower
corner of the longitudinal tang of the fitting move in a
downward arc, producing a deep groove on the upper surface
of the bottom lateral beam spanning fuselage Frame 34. This
rotation also created a 'V' shaped notch on the aft support
angle of the beam as it broke free (Refer Photograph 10).
38

1.16.3.4 In view of the rotary movement of the tang of the
fitting, the fitting and the adjacent structure was
examined for broken fasteners and evidence of shear damage.
None of the fasteners were found. There was not a single
sheared-shank of the hi-lok fasteners that were supposed to
have been used as per the DORNIER Structural Repair Manual.
Neither were any of the sheared-off heads, shanks and
collars of hi -lok fasteners found on the supporting
brackets and tang nor were they inside the rear fuselage
shell of the aircraft. This led the Committee to conclude
that qty. 10 hi-lok fasteners had not been installed at
that crucial control surface fitting, which was a Critical
Structural Element(CSE) in DO-228 aircraft.
1.16.3.5(cid:9) It was observed that the holes in the tang had
melted primer and soot. Microscopic examination of the
fractured surfaces of the attachments at Frame No. 34 was
carried out using a Scanning Electron Microscope. Scanned
fractograph of the fracture surface showed extensive
oxidation of the surface and cracking up of the oxide
layer, which was caused by the post crash fire.
1.16.4
Examination of the Trimmable Horizontal Stabilizer
Actuator :
1.16.4.1 The Trimmable Horizontal Stabilizer (THS)
actuator was sent to HAL, Kanpur for a functional check.
The examination report is at Exhibit No.31. The report
stated that there was no physical damage to the actuator.
The functional test included the potentiometer test, travel
checks, load tests, slip test and di-electric test. Results
of the functional tests were found to be within acceptable
39

limits and the trim actuator was found serviceable. As a
confirmatory test, a functional check was carried out after
operating the actuator continuously for 100 cycles. All
readings were once again within specified limits. It was
confirmed that the THS actuator was serviceable even after
one hundred continuous cycles in the second functional
test.
1.16.4.2 In view of the fact that in both functional
tests, the actuator was found serviceable, it was inferred
that it was serviceable after the accident. By the same
observation, it was inferred that the actuator was
serviceable before the accident. The accident had not
damaged it at all.
1.17 Organizational and Management Information :
1.17.1 Sh. P.C. Sen was the Chairman & Managing Director
of Indian Airlines and Shri V. Kashyap was the Executive
Director of Short Haul Operations Department (SHOD) of
Indian Airlines. Shri S.B. Gokhale was the Off. General
Manager Engineering of SHOD.
1.18 Additional Information :
1.18.1 A meeting was held at Mumbai on 24.9.98 and 25.9.98
between the Committee of Inquiry and Dornier Luftfahrt Gmbh
experts from Germany and the possible scenario of the
accident was discussed. Dornier experts were requested to
provide details regarding transfer of trim actuator loads
on to the fuselage structure. Operational loads on trim
actuator under normal operation as well as with 10 hi-lok
fasteners missing were also requested. The experts were
40

asked to provide an assessment of longitudinal
controllability with partially detached trim actuator
forward attachment bearing supporting fitting of the THS.
1.18.2 Regarding transfer of trim actuator loads on to the
fuselage, the experts stated (Exhibit No.32) that the trim
actuator horizontal load was transferred via fitting lug,
forward tang, lateral shear ribs, upper supporting
beam(20%) and lower supporting beam(80%) to the side of the
fuselage. Trim actuator vertical (and lateral) loads were
transferred via fitting shear flange to web of Frame 34.
For a structure with 10 hi-lok fasteners missing, the shear
load transfer from fitting forward tang to lateral shear
ribs decreased rapidly. For positive horizontal loads
(tension) the carrying capacity changed from +300...500 daN
(fitting vertical shear flange riveting to Frame 34 web
intact) to about 0 daN for a fitting in the dislocated
position (fitting vertical shear flange lower rivets
broken, or web skin around fitting broken). Negative
horizontal loads (compression) were not reduced due to the
fitting being supported by supporting beams.
1.18.3 As per data supplied by Dornier, the only
significant trim actuator tension load occurred in a push
over maneuver.
1.18.4(cid:9) Dornier stated that operating with 10 hi-lok
fasteners missing from the fitting forward flange was
possible, as long as the trim actuator tension load did not
exceed 300...500 daN. Such a load would occur during a push
over maneuver. Probably the residual trim actuator tension
load decreased continuously (structural configuration;
riveting vertical shear flange to Frame 34 and lower
41

supporting beam intact) to 0 daN (nearly complete fitting
dismounted, no connection between fitting and Frame 34 or
lower supporting beam) over a defined period. The period'in
which significant trim actuator tension loads may occur
will vary.
1.18.5 Regarding assessment of longitudinal controllability
with partially detached trim actuator of THS, Dornier
stated that from the wreckage scenario, a pull force on the
fitting must be assumed, which can hardly be considered as
a result of the impact mass forces, which tend to create a
push force on the fitting. Therefore the detachment of the
fitting has to be considered as an in-flight event, which
was generally assessed to be uncontrollable by the pilot.
They stated that as known from flight test measurements the
force on the trim actuator (or the fitting) resulting from
mass and aerodynamic forces in a trimmed condition was a
low push force, which increased when the pilot pulled the
control column (for instance to increase the load factor).
On the other hand the push force at the actuator decreased
and became a pull force, when the pilot pushed the control
column forward for instance to correct the attitude or to
counteract a pitch up mistrim. They stated that assuming a
push input of the pilot high enough to start the detachment
of the bracket the consequent displacement of the THS due
to the detachment was leading edge (LE) down, which meant
the aircraft would tend to pitch up despite the push input
of the pilot. Any instinctive push on the column by the
pilot to counteract the pitch-up increased the pull force
on the trim-actuator. From the damage to Frame 34 it can be
assumed, that the fitting remained attached only with the
upper bolts and the fitting could swivel about that axis.
An additional deflection -14° (LE down) of the THS
42

had to be taken into account at minimum, not considering
any elastic deformation of Frame 34. With the fitting fully
detached a maximum of -17°(LE down) deflection of the THS
was possible. At this deflection the upper surface of the
THS hit the rudder. The trim actuator was found fully
retracted corresponding to full nose down trim (=+1.6° LE
up). The trim position for a speed of 110 KCAS and the
loading condition of the aircraft was about +0.5°. With the
displacement of the detached fitting an effective
deflection of -12.4° (LE down) had to be considered at a
minimum. A sudden mistrim of 14° from trimmed flight could
not be counteracted by elevator control regardless of the
stick-forces which would be required. With the maximum
elevator (TE down) deflection of 25° a maximum of about 10°
mistrim was controllable requiring at 110 KCAS a pilot
force of a minimum of 50 daN. Even with optimum pilot
effort a pitch up could not be avoided. The pitch up would
give rise to a positive load factor of estimated 2g. An
uncontrolled increase of the angle of climb would be the
consequence with rapid decrease of airspeed.
1.18.6(cid:9) Shri V. Kashyap, Executive Director, SHOD, deposed
before the Committee of Inquiry on 6.10.98 (Exhibit No.33).
Regarding lack of orderly lines of communication in the
maintenance wing of SHOD and the working environment not
being fully congenial and friendly, he stated that the SHOD
was formed in partial compliance of Government of India
orders for merger of Vayudoot with Indian Airlines. The
Ministry of Civil Aviation decided in May, 1993 that
Vayudoot should be merged with Indian Airlines. This
decision was taken by Govt. without eliciting any views
from Indian Airlines. The decision of the Govt. evoked
opposition from Indian Airlines as well as Vayudoot
43

employees. While on the one hand, Indian Airlines employees
objected to the merger on the grounds that induction of
Vayudoot employees would have an adverse effect_ on their
career progression, Vayudoot employees objected to the
merger on the grounds that according to the prevalent rules
of Indian Airlines they would have to join at the lowest
rung of a particular cadre. The trade unions of Indian
Airlines had even formed a coordination committee for this
purpose. On the other hand, Vayudoot employees started
agitations/hunger strikes resulting in disruption of work.
One employee of Vayudoot even threatened self-immolation.
In this surcharged atmosphere Indian Airlines had no option
but not to proceed with the legal merger and absorb the
employees in the respective departments. It, therefore,
created a Short Haul Operations Department in which
employees of Vayudoot were placed separate from the cadres
of Indian Airlines. The facilities of Vayudoot were also
not merged with the respective facilities of Indian
Airlines. The procedures and systems of Vayudoot, therefore
continued in totality. The communication channels, which
had earlier existed in Vayudoot also continued. The
Airworthiness Authorities had approved these systems and
procedures as they had accorded their approval to the SHOD
for maintenance of Dornier aircraft. He said Vayudoot was
formed in 1982 and their procedures, systems and lines of
maintenance had been in vogue since the formation of the
company and it had become a "way of life" with the officers
and employees of the organisation. It is only after the
unfortunate accident at Kochi that the Directorate General
of Civil Aviation had withdrawn the approvals of the SHOD
and its Quality Control Officers. The first maintenance
audit by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation was
carried out after the accident.
44

1.18.7(cid:9)
With reference to the delay in merger of employees
in the respective departments of Indian Airlines so that
they could be fully functional with the system of
procedures of Indian Airlines, he said the employees of
SHOD were not ready to enter at the bottom of the
respective cadres as applicable in Indian Airlines. A
number of employees of SHOD had also filed legal suits. A
stream of representations continued to be received by the
management of Indian Airlines regarding employees of SHOD
not getting their due while they were working in Vayudoot
before 1993. He added that normally when a merger of two
public sector undertakings was announced by the Government,
the Govt. also issued a scheme of absorption of the merging
organizations. In the present case no such scheme was
issued by the Government of India. Even recommendations of
the Absorption Committee formed by the Govt. of India have
been questioned by the employees of SHOD in courts and
other fora. The Govt. held the first meeting to consider
the absorption of employees in the respective cadres of
Indian Airlines in March 1998. This was followed by another
meeting in April 1998. Only a handful of employees of SHOD
had agreed with the recommendations made at these meetings
and problems of large sections still remained unresolved.
Under these circumstances it may still take quite some time
for a complete merger of seniority of the SHOD employees in
the respective departments of Indian Airlines. In the
absence of this the old way of life with the Short Haul
Operations Department will continue till SHOD convert to
work practices, systems, procedures and lines of
communication practiced in Indian Airlines.
45

1.18.8(cid:9) Regarding paucity of funds for repair of aircraft
of SHOD or any inadequacy in budgetary allocation, he
stated that no budgetary problems were faced in repair 'of
the aircraft of SHOD by Indian Airlines. The company in
fact was spending a very large amount on the wage bill of
SHOD employees and was also meeting all other obligations
for maintenance of aircraft, engines and components. This
will be borne out by the evidence that all operational
aircraft had valid Certificate of Airworthiness from the
Directorate General of Civil Aviation. The Dornier aircraft
VT-EJW was placed in service after incurring an expenditure
in excess of Rs.3 crores. The Company had also agreed to
spend in excess of Rs. 4 cores to put another aircraft back
into service.
1.18.9 As for the decision taken to put back aircraft VT-
EJW into service, he stated that Vayudoot had a fleet of
eight Dornier aircraft in 1993 at the time of the merger of
Vayudoot with Indian Airlines. Of these only three aircraft
were operational in the North-East and the remaining five
were not in use. All five aircraft were evaluated and
assessed by M/s Dornier, the aircraft manufacturers. The
Company had expressed a view that two more aircraft could
be economically repaired and put back into service while
the other three aircraft were beyond economical repair.
Based on this opinion the company decided to repair Dornier
aircraft VT-EJW.
1.18.10(cid:9) Regarding the areas cf responsibility of various
officers in the maintenance and quality control set up, he
stated that while day-to-day maintenance at Delhi was
supervised by Shri V.C.M Kutty, Chief Manager, Indian
Airlines had brought on deputation Shri J.K. Dasgupta of
46

Eastern Region to supervise maintenance activities at
Calcutta. Shri S.B. Gokhale, Dy.General Manager of Indian
Airlines was seconded to be the overall incharge of
engineering and aircraft maintenance wings of the SHOD. He
was designated as Off. General Manager (Engg) of SHOD.
Shri Kutty and Shri Dasgupta reported to Shri Gokhale. Shri
O.K. Bakshi was the Quality Control Manager of the SHOD. He
reported to the Executive Director. He (Sh. Kashyap) had
met all the officers on a number of occasions and at no
point of time had they brought to his notice any difference
of opinion among themselves. None of them had on any
occasion brought any problem regarding maintenance of the
aircraft or non-availability of funds to his notice. Shri
V.C.M Kutty had represented on many occasions directly or
through a number of outside officers to be appointed as
Head of the maintenance organisation. Shri O.K Bakshi had
some personal matters regarding his designation and
emoluments which were resolved way back and had no other
complaint pending against the management of Indian
Airlines.
1.18.11 Shri P.C. Sen, Chairman and Managing Director of
Indian Airlines, deposed before the Chairman, Committee of
the Inquiry on 9.11.98 (Exhibit No.34). Shri Sen explained
the compulsions under which SHOD was formed as a separate
department of Indian Airlines. He gave the reasons why a
complete merger could not be effected to date. The higher
management organisation of Indian Airlines was also
explained by him. As far as SHOD was concerned, he said he
had created the post of an Executive Director and empowered
him to manage that department.
47

(cid:9)(cid:9)
1.18.12(cid:9) Shri N. Ramesh, Dy. Director General of Civil
Aviation at DGCA (Headquarters), Delhi deposed before the
Committee on 29.10.98. He stated that (Exhibit No.35) 'he
held the responsibility of supervising the Airworthiness
Directorate in addition to some of the responsibilities of
Air Transport Directorate. The responsibility basically
revolved around framing of airworthiness policies in the
light of ICAO document, FAR and issuing them in the form of
Aircraft Rules, Civil Aviation Requirements and Advisory
Circulars. Also the implementation of various requirements
by Regional/sub-regional airworthiness officers was done
through issuance of Airworthiness Instructions, which was
the hand book of Airworthiness Officers for implementation
of airworthiness policies. Lasides he supervised the
training of officers on aircraft operating in India
including training of officers abroad whenever a new type
of aircraft was introduced into the country so that the
officer entrusted with the responsibility of supervising
maintenance of these aircraft had full knowledge of the
aircraft and operation of various systems installed in it.
1.18.13(cid:9) With reference to maintenance of Dornier aircraft
by SHOD of Indian Airlines, he said the Airworthiness
Directorate at Headquarters had been monitoring their
maintenance through surveillance/audit/spot check reports
received from the Director of Airworthiness (DAW), Delhi
and other offices. The DAW, Delhi had been continuously
monitoring maintenance of Dornier aircraft of SHOD. He had
carried out an audit in Sept. 97 while renewing the firm's
approval for maintenance. Discrepancies noticed had been
brought to the notice of Quality Control Manager (QCM),
SHOD for necessary corrective action. Similarly detailed
audit at the instance of Headquarters was carried out by
48

DAW, Delhi in March,98 wherein several serious
discrepancies had been noticed and were brought to the
notice of QCM, SHOD for taking immediate corrective action.
Similarly, office of the Controller of Airworthiness,
Thiruvananthapuram had carried out an audit of Agati base
in July,97 where again certain deficiencies were observed
and the same were brought to the notice of QCM, SHOD for
taking appropriate corrective action. He said the DGCA of
late had introduced an internal audit by the operators to
make them responsible for adhering to airworthiness
standards.
1.18.14 DGCA had been carrying out continuous
surveillance checks on the maintenance activities of SHOD.
1.18.15 To assist the Regional/sub-regional offices in
carrying out meaningful surveillance/safety audit/spot
checks, detailed check lists had been prepared by
Headquarters on various inspections like inspection of
aircraft, inspection of hangars, inspection of Quality
Control department, inspection of overhaul shops and these
had been distributed to all the Regional/Sub-regional
offices with the advice that these check lists were to be
used while carrying out surveillance/ audit. They had
further been advised to amend the check lists wherever
necessary to meet the local requirements. Officers from
various regions were sent to different regions to carry out
the audit of various operators so that the technical skill
of the officers for carrying out surveillance was fine
tuned/enhanced.
1.18.16 He said that DGCA had contributed to the training
programme of International Civil Aviation Organisation
49

(cid:9)(cid:9)
(ICAO) wherein they will be training DGCA officers to carry
out surveillance/safety audit at par with international
standards. He said that it was a fact that a lot more
required to be done by the Airworthiness Directorate to
shoulder the responsibilities entrusted to them. However,
there was a great need for additional man-power as at
present the Airworthiness Directorate was also required to
do additional work such as invigilation of examinations,
conduct of oral examinations, attending to VVIP movements
and administration, which tied down a big proportion of
manpower and reduced the time available to carry out
meaningful surveillance.
1.18.17(cid:9) He said that the present system of maintenance of
an approved firm worked under delegated system of
responsibility wherein the QCM who was approved by DGCA
shouldered the entire responsibility of adhering to
airworthiness standards as laid down by DGCA. The DGCA's
responsibility was to carry out surveillance and spot
checks.
1.18.18(cid:9) Wg. Cdr. S.C. Sharma (Retd.), father of late
Capt. Manish Sharma (Co-pilot) expressed a desire to depose
before the Committee. He deposed before the Committee on 9th
and 10th September,98. During the deposition, he requested
permission to hear the CVR and read the DFR output.
Permission was granted by the Committee. He heard the CVR,
read the DFR output and thereafter expressed his views
about the crash.
1.18.19(cid:9) Shri P. Mohanan, Regional Dy. Commissioner of
Security (RDCOS), Chennai visited the site of accident at
Kochi on the morning of 31.7.98. The Committee had
50

requested Commissioner of Security, Civil Aviation, Delhi
on 20.8.98 to forward the report submitted by Shri Mohanan
covering sabotage/explosive aspects. A reminder was sent to
the Commissioner of Security, Civil Aviation, on 7.9.98 to
forward the report. On 11.9.98, Shri S. Banerjee, Dy.
Commissioner of Security, Civil Aviation informed the
Committee that an inquiry on possible sabotage/explosive
aspects of the crash was being conducted by him and some
documents were awaited and on completion of the detailed
inquiry, the report would be made available. Further
reminders were sent on 15.9.98, 21.9.98, 5.10.98 and
13.10.98 to the Commissioner of Security, Civil Aviation
requesting him to expedite submission of the report. While
the accident was still under investigation by the Committee
of Inquiry, the office of Commissioner of Security, Civil
Aviation directly informed the Ministry of Civil Aviation
on 21.10.98 (Shri S.K.Singhal, Under Secretary) that Shri
Banerjee had been deputed to conduct a detailed inquiry
into the incident and his report had been received at
Office of Commissioner of Security, Civil Aviation.(cid:9)
He
stated that on the basis of the report, no characteristic
sign of sabotage was found with respect to the crash of IC-
501, DO-228 VT-EJW. A copy of the above note to the
Ministry of Civil Aviation was also endorsed to the
Committee of Inquiry.
1.18.20 On 21.10.98, Commissioner of Security, Civil
Aviation was again reminded to expedite submission of the
detailed report on the aspect of sabotage/explosive. On
23.10.98, the Office of Commissioner of Security sent the
report to the Committee. The report is at Exhibit No.36.
51

1.18.21(cid:9) The report stated that as per the order (dated
2.9.98) of the Commissioner of Security, Civil Aviation,
Shri(cid:9) Banerjee, visited Kochi on 8.9.98 to conduct' a
detailed inquiry to ascertain whether there was any
sabotage due to a lapse of security measures or any kind of
unlawful obstruction to Civil Aviation in respect of crash
of IC-503.
1.18.22 The report said that forensic survey of the
splinters as well as of the wreckage was conducted by a
Forensic(cid:9) Science(cid:9) Laboratory(cid:9) (FSL)(cid:9) team(cid:9) from
Thiruvananthapuram in the presence of Shri Mohanan and as
per their report submitted to BCAS, "No characteristic
features of any explosion could be noticed. There was smell
of burnt and charred organic material inside the building
on which the aircraft crashed".
1.18.23(cid:9) Shri Banerjee concluded in his report that based
on the available documents and facts of the case, there was
no sabotage involved in the crash of the said flight.
However the report pointed out that as per the FSL team
samples had not been collected from the spot because it was
not allowed by "aerodrome officers" present at the crash
site. The report pointed out that as per Shri Mohanan's
message, DGCA officials had discouraged the team from
collecting samples. The report also stated that non-
collection of samples by the FSL team should be viewed
seriously as they were not duty bound to follow the
advice/instructions of "aerodrome officers".
1.18.24 Shri Mohanan, deposed before the Committee of
Inquiry on 29.10.98. He said (Exhibit No.37) he reached the
site of accident at Kochi on 31.7.98 on the instructions of
52

Commissioner of Security, New Delhi. He examined the crash
site and the aircraft. He also conducted a survey for any
explosive material at the crash site or nearby along with
the FSL team, which had arrived from Thiruvananthapuram.
The FSL team confirmed to him that they had not found any
evidence of explosion. He stated that after few days he was
instructed by Commissioner of Security, Civil Aviation, to
get a report from FSL, Thiruvananthapuram. He contacted
Shri Viswanathan, Joint Director, FSL and he (Shri
Viswanathan) was apologetic saying that they could not
collect any samples as Civil Aviation officials and perhaps
DGCA officials had not allowed them to collect the samples.
They had felt discouraged by this refusal and therefore no
test of the samples was carried out.
1.18.25 Shri Mohanan confirmed during the deposition
before the Committee that the FSL team had not informed him
about any difficulty in collecting the samples on 31.10.98
at the crash site.
1.18.26 From the foregoing, it was clear that the FSL
team had surveyed the crash site along with Shri Mohanan on
31.7.98 and confirmed to him that that they had not found
any evidence of an explosion. it was evident that the FSL
team had not felt the necessity to collect samples as they
had not informed Shri Mohanan about any difficulty in
collecting the samples, while conducting a survey of the
crash site along with him. On the instructions of
Commissioner of Security Civil Aviation, Shri Viswanathan
was asked for a report by Shri Mohanan at a later date.
Shri Viswanathan then tried to apportion blame on some
aerodrome official perhaps DGCA official (of which he was
not sure) to cover up the failure of the FSL team to
53

collect samples. They could have taken samples if they felt
it necessary for their examination as they were not duty
bound to follow the advice/instructions of any aerodrome
official while discharging their duties for which they were
deputed to the site of the accident.
1.18.27(cid:9) As Shri Banerjee had drawn a firm conclusion that
there was no evidence of an explosion, the Committee did
not feel it necessary to probe this aspect further.

2.AMALYSIS
2.1 Airworthiness Aspects :
2.1.1(cid:9) The aircraft was manufactured by HAL Kanpur in
1986 and was operated and maintained by erstwhile Vayudoot
Ltd. It was grounded on 6.3.93 for 1800 hrs/1 year
inspection and the C of A of the aircraft expired on
10.11.93. In 1994, there was a merger of Vayudoot with
Indian Airlines and the Short Haul Operations Department
(SHOD) was formed. In March 97, Indian Airlines (SHOD) took
up the matter with DAW (DGCA) Delhi region to resume
operating VT-EJW and submitted the quantum of work, as
mentioned in para 1.6.1, for approval for the purpose of C
of A renewal. Rebuilding of the aircraft (VT-EJW) started
on 27.5.96 and continued till 14.4.98. Rebuild included
compliance of 4800 flying hours/8 years inspection
schedules. While carrying out these schedules, THS actuator-
fitting was removed and sent to the non-destructive testing
54

(NDT) shop for eddy current inspection (ECI). During the
NDT inspection, it was found that it had excessive pitting
and was therefore rejected. Later on, a fitting of the same
part no. was removed from aircraft VT-EJU and sent for ECI.
The fitting was declared serviceable and installed on
VT-EJW.
2.1.2(cid:9)
The aircraft was test flown for C of A renewal
and the same was renewed on 27.4.98. At the time of C of A
renewal, the aircraft had done 13289:20 hrs since
manufacture.(cid:9)
The aircraft was positioned at Agati for
scheduled operations. On 21.7.98, 300 hrs inspection
schedule was carried out and also the flight release was
issued at Agati. Inspection schedule at 300 hrs called for
removal of the tail cone fairing for lubrication of the
rudder trim chain. With the tail cone fairing removed,
Frame 34 area would have been visible. Apparently no signs
of damage to the actuator attachment fitting and the
surrounding area were observed by maintenance personnel. On
the morning of 30.7.98, Check 'B' inspection schedule was
carried out by Shri Anurag Yadav (licence Cat.'A') and Shri
Satish Raina (licence Cat.'C') and the aircraft was
released to operate the scheduled flight IC-501, (Agati-
Kochi-
Tiruvanathapuram). The flight from Agati to Kochi was
uneventful. While proceeding on the Kochi-Tiruvananthapuram
leg, the aircraft crashed about a minute after take off
from Kochi.
2.1.3(cid:9) During examination of the wreckage, it was
observed that near Frame 34, the fuselage skin had a slight
bulge and a crack on the left at stringer 7 level. On the
right at the same level, two rivets were found sheared off
and two were found partially pulled inward. Frames 30 thru
55

33 had no visual damage in the form of buckling, cracks, or
pulled rivets or any other deformation. During inspection
through access panels on the LHS and RHS of the rear
fuselage, it was observed that 10 hi-lok fasteners, which
attach the forward tang of the actuator bearing support
fitting to two longitudinal brackets, were not found in
place. All ten holes were clear and there was no visible
distortion of the holes on the longitudinal brackets.
Inside the rear fuselage shell, there was no sign of any
sheared hi-lok fastener or collar.
2.1.4(cid:9) Frame 34 web, the bearing support fitting, two
longitudinal brackets on either side and the top and bottom
mounting plates were sent to the National Aerospace
Laboratories (NAL), Bangalore for further examination. The
examination report is at Exhibit No.30.(cid:9) The parts were
observed visually and under a stereobinocular microscope
and scanning electron microscope. During examination, the
actuator bearing support fitting (aluminium alloy 7010
milled part) was found covered with a thin layer of soot
deposit in some regions (Refer Photograph 11). Ten fastener
holes on the tang of the bearing support fitting had not
suffered any deformation or damage. The insides of the
holes were covered with soot, melted paint etc. The two eye
ends were intact with the steel bushes in place. The two
sheet metal (aluminium alloy 2024) brackets on either side
of the bearing support fitting were found relatively intact
(Refer Photograph 12). The 10 holes on each of the brackets
where the bracket was attached to the bearing support
fitting were relatively undamaged (Refer Photograph 13).
Except for two or three fastener holes, which showed slight
ovality due to deformation and fastener impressions caused
during derivetting, the rest of the holes were undamaged.
56

All holes had soot deposits. No fasteners, broken pieces or
collars were found in the wreckage. The angle in front of
the bottom base plate on which the fitting and the
longitudinal support plates were mounted had fractured
along with the fitting. It had also buckled in the region
where the longitudinal brackets were mounted (Refer
Photograph 14). The web of bulkhead at Frame 34 to which
the bearing support fitting was attached was found torn,
running along the rivets on one side and away from the
rivets on the opposite side (Refer Photograph 15). The
fracture surfaces were covered with soot deposits and were
rubbed in some areas, but the gross features of the
fracture indicated tearing under tensile load. Fractured
pieces from the angle in front of the bottom base plate
were observed under a scanning electron microscope. The
fractured surfaces were oxidized due to post impact fire.
Some regions showed features resembling dimpled rupture.
Fatigue striations were not visible due to oxidation.
However, based on the macroscopic fracture morphology and
the absence of gross plastic deformation on the fracture
surfaces, fatigue could not be ruled out.
2.1.5(cid:9) Lack of significant deformation or damage to the
fastener holes of the tang of the bearing support fitting
and the two longitudinal brackets, and the absence of any
broken pieces of fastener in the space between the tang
and the brackets suggested that the fasteners were not
present at the time of the crash. If the fasteners had been
in position, the force required to shear them would have
led to significant deformation of the fastener holes and
even tearing of the holes atleast in the thin bracket
sheets. Also, some of the broken fasteners should have been
retained in place trapped on the tang since the holes in it
57

(cid:9)(cid:9)
were blinded due to its displacement with respect to
brackets. This suggested that the fasteners were not fixed
in place.
2.1.6(cid:9)
It was concluded that the type of damage observed
on the tang and the brackets suggested that the hi-lok
fasteners were not fixed on to the holes. The absence of 10
hi-lok fasteners led to excessive loading on the bottom
angle, which finally fractured.
2.1.7(cid:9)
From the foregoing, it was evident that while
reinstalling the THS Actuator attachment bearing support
fitting, after the ECI, 10 hi-lok fasteners were not
installed. Examination of maintenance documents revealed
that for removal and replacement of THS fitting, the job
sheet was prepared by Shri V.K. Srivastava, Chief Manager
Engineering, SHOD, Indian Airlines. After removal and
reinstallation of the fitting, job sheet was signed on
18.2.98 by Shri Sher Singh, foreman employed on contract
against the mechanic column and Shri V.K. Srivastava
against the AME column.
2.1.8(cid:9)
During deposition before the Committee on 7.8.98,
Shri Sher Singh stated (Exhibit No.38) that he was working
as a foreman in SHOD on a yearly contract. Earlier he had
worked in Indian Airlines as a bench fitter and sheet metal
repair mechanic and after his retirement from Indian
Airlines, he was on contract with erstwhile Vayudoot. Three
regular staff of SHOD of Indian Airlines namely Shri T.D.
Paul, Shri Om Prakash, both technicians, and Shri Satish
Khanna, a helper, were attached with him for day-to-day
work. Shri Sher Singh stated that regarding the THS trim
actuator fitting, Shri T.D. Paul and Shri Khanna had

designation was Aircraft Technician. He had been asked by
Shri Sher Singh to remove the fitting from aircraft VT-EJW.
He along with Shri Rawat and Shri S.K. Khanna removed the
fitting. There was no AME present at that time. Normally
the work was given to them by the foreman verbally and no
AME was available to give instructions. He had initially
drilled out the rivets on the rear face of the fitting and
then the hi-lok fasteners from inside the fuselage through
the access panel. The fitting was then taken to the NDT
shop. After that he had applied the primer and did not
remember after how many days the fitting was brought back
to the aircraft for fitment. Along with the fitting, rivets
and hi-lok fasteners had also been given to him. He had
installed the fasteners. Shri Sher Singh, Shri Rawat and
Shri Khanna were with him but he could not recollect
whether any particular fastener was installed by him or
not. He did not remember whether any of the fasteners was
installed by him. After completion of the job, he had
informed the foreman that the job had been completed and he
had not seen him (Shri Sher Singh) inspecting it. He had
not seen any AME inspecting that job. Normally after small
repairs whenever he was told to sign the work sheet, he
used to sign it. In this particular case, he had not been
asked to sign anywhere and therefore had not signed.
2.1.10(cid:9)
Shri Satish Khanna, helper, during deposition
before the Committee on 7.8.98 stated (Exhibit No.40) that
he had been working with Shri Sher Singh and Shri T.D. Paul
and did jobs like painting, removal of paint, cleaning and
moving things from one place to another. He was aware that
VT-EJW aircraft which was parked outside the hangar for a
long time had been brought inside the hangar. He was also
aware that the fitting, which was shown to him, was
60

connected to the stabilizer actuator. He had cleaned the
whole fitment area and applied primer. The fitting had been
removed and given to him by Shri Sher Singh for cleaning.
After cleaning, the fitting was sent to the NDT shop. He
could not recollect after how many days the fitting had
come back for fitment on the aircraft. When the fitting was
being installed, he had helped Shri T.D. Paul to rivet the
fitting. He had held the dolly from the inside. He was
aware that there were four hi-lok fasteners on the rear
face of the fitting and the remaining were rivets. When he
was installing the rivets, he had noticed that the four hi-
lok fasteners on the face of the fitting had already been
installed. When he was helping to install the rivets, at
that time the lateral hi-lok fasteners on the tang of the
fitting had not been installed. If these had been
installed, it would have been difficult for him to hold the
dolly for doing the riveting.. After the riveting job, he
had been sent for some other work. He had not seen anybody
installing the hi-lok fasteners on the tang of the fitting.
He had cleaned the entire area before the installation of
the fitting.
Shri V.K. Srivastava, Chief Manager Engineering,
2.1.11(cid:9)
during deposition before the Committee on 7.8.98 stated
(Exhibit No.41) that he had earlier been working in Agro
Aviation, Directorate of Agricultural Aviation and was sent
on deputation to Vayudoot in 1988. In 1990 Agro Aviation
merged with Vayudoot and in 1994 Vayudoot merged with
Indian Airlines. His present designation in SHOD was Chief
Manager Engineering and his primary responsibility was for
Production Planning and Control (PPC).
61

2.1.12 He stated that when he was working in the
Directorate of Agricultural Aviation, he had undertaken a
lot of structural work on aircraft. Even though he had a
'B' licence on small aircraft, at present he was not making
use of that. Whatever structural jobs were done, were being
done on specific approvals.
2.1.13 He stated that the job sheet, which was used for
replacement of the THS actuator attachment fitting, was
prepared by him. When questioned by the Committee, he
agreed that it was not an approved procedure sheet. He had
looked into the Illustrated Parts Catalogue (IPC) and
Structural Repair Manual (SRM) and prepared the job sheet.
He had not mentioned the fastener part nos. in the job
sheet. He added that initially he was not involved in
replacement of the THS actuator attachment fitting. He had
therefore not supervised the removal of the fitting. He was
not aware, who had removed the fitting. His name had been
proposed for riveting and deriveting at a later stage. He
felt that he was given the approval based on his earlier
experience of structural repairs. By the time the approval
was given to him, the fitting had already been installed.
He had been aware that the required hi-lok fasteners were
not available in the stores, but Shri Sher Singh had
informed him that the required fasteners were available
with the surplus stock left behind by the Dornier repair
team.
2.1.14(cid:9)
He had inspected the fitting from the outside,
after its installation on aircraft VT-EJW and found that
the fitting had been installed properly. He had not
inspected the fitting on the forward side of Frame 34
through the access panels. He had not used a trestle
62

required to reach the access panel to carry out the
inspection of the fitting. Instead he had checked up with
Shri Sher Singh regarding installation of the fitting and
he (Shri Sher Singh) had confirmed to him that everything
had been installed. He had then referred the IPC of Dornier
aircraft and made the job sheet. He was aware that the
installed fitting was serviceable because the same had been
confirmed to him by Shri V.K. Jain, who had carried out the
ECI.
2.1.15 Shri Sher Singh again deposed before the
Committee on 9.9.98. On being asked as to who had given him
instructions for removal of the fitting, he stated that
(Exhibit No.42) he did not remember who had done so. He
said there was no proper system by which these instructions
were given. On being queried again as to who would have
given instructions for such jobs, Shri Sher Singh stated
that the engineer who looked after that area would
normally have given instructions but for that particular
work no structural engineer was available. On being asked
that if the engineer was not there, whether there was
anybody else higher than the level of an engineer to give
instructions, he stated that Shri V.C. Mathoo Kutty, the
Chief Manager Engineering was at a higher level but he
normally did not come to the aircraft. He came to the floor
level only at times to check the progress of the work.
Regarding removal of the fitting from another aircraft (VT-
EJU), he was asked who had given him instructions for that
work. Shri Sher Singh stated that he did not remember but
he had instructed Shri T.D.Paul to remove the fitting from
the other aircraft (VT-EJU) and it was possible that he had
taken the decision himself. Regarding installation of any
fasteners on the fitting, he stated that he could not
63

recollect, but he may have helped to install some fasteners
in a difficult location.
2.1.16 Shri T.D. Paul while deposing before the
Committee on 9.9.98, stated that (Exhibit No.43) neither
had Shri Sher Singh told him to remove the fitting from
another aircraft (VT-EJU) nor had he removed the same. He
added that he had installed the fitting on VT-EJW along
with Shri Sher Singh and Shri Khanna and whenever he had
been working on VT-EJW, he had also been entrusted with
other jobs occasionally. On being queried whether he was in
the habit of checking whether all the fasteners had been
installed before reporting the completion of the job, he
stated that Shri Sher Singh had also been with him.
2.1.17(cid:9)
Shri V.K. Srivastava deposed before the Committee
on 9.9.98 and on being asked who had given instructions for
removal of the fitting from VT-EJW, he stated that (Exhibit
No.44) he had been asking everybody, but nobody had been
willing to come out with the answer as to who had given
these instructions. Possibly, Shri Mathoo Kutty might have
given the instructions. When asked at what stage he had
come to know that the fitting was to be certified by him,
he stated that Shri O.K. Bakshi, Quality Control Manager
(QCM), had informed him that he (Shri Srivastava) had the
approval for riveting and de-riveting. By that time, the
actuator attachment bracket installation had already been
completed. He had inspected the fitting from the rear of
Frame 34 and had been informed by Shri Sher Singh that hi-
lok fasteners had been installed. When queried about such a
haphazard style of working in SHOD, he replied that as far
as he was concerned, he did not belong to maintenance at
all. He had always been in PPC. It was only when he was
64

(cid:9)(cid:9)
asked to do some work in maintenance, did he go there. If
there had been a proper organisation in SHOD, he would not
have been called for that work at all. Regarding the
pressure of completing the work on the aircraft, he stated
that pressure had been there. The work had already slipped
behind schedule and he felt that higher authorities wanted
the aircraft flying as soon as possible.
(cid:9)
2.1.18 Other officials of SHOD, namely Shri O.K. Bakshi,
Chief Manager (Engg) and Shri Anurag Yadav, AME also
deposed before the Committee.
2.1.19(cid:9) Deposing before the Committee on 10.9.98, Shri
O.K. Bakshi, who had been functioning as QCM, stated
(Exhibit No.45) that when the rebuild of VT-EJW was
undertaken, Director of Airworthiness, Delhi region had
granted a general approval to Shri Srivastava to carry out
de-riveting and riveting on the aircraft whenever required.
He stated that Structural Sampling Inspection (SSI 53-21)
required ECI of the fitting in question. To facilitate this
inspection, the fitting had to be removed from the aircraft
from Frame 34 and sent to the NDT Shop for ECI. The fitting
was to have been reinstalled on the aircraft after passing
ECI. In his opinion, that job was a simple case of removal
and installation and could not be termed a major structural
job. He stated that whenever a part was removed from an
aircraft and it failed during inspection, it was normally
replaced by a serviceable part drawn from the stores.
However, at times, if the specific part was not available
in the stores, the same was cannibalized from another
aircraft. The decision/ instruction for cannibalization of
any part was normally given by an officer at the managerial
level. The Quality Control (QC) office was not aware of the
65

failure of the original fitting belonging to VT-EJW to pass
ECI and subsequent cannibalization of the fitting from
another aircraft for fitment on VT-EJW.
2.1.20(cid:9)
He stated that procedure sheets were prepared by
the QC section only in respect of major jobs like engine
change, landing gear change, engine power assurance checks
and for overhaul of rotable components in various
workshops. For all other works which were carried out on an
aircraft, the aircraft engineer was required to use off-job
sheets on which he had to write step-wise details of the
work carried out by him or any instructions to technicians
in regard to the work being carried out. Individual jobs
carried out on the aircraft by technicians or helpers were
under the direct supervision of the Aircraft Engineer
allotted on that particular system/job. However, all
activities in the engineering hangar were under
guidance/supervision of the Manager in-charge of
maintenance.
2.1.21(cid:9)
He stated that VT-EJW had undergone 4800 hrs and
8 yearly inspection schedules during the build up. A
scrutiny of these inspection schedules indicated that the
Frame 34 area was inspected for general condition,
integrity of parts etc. The above inspection of Frame 34
area was also covered in various lower schedules. Frame 34
area would have been visible even during the 300 hrs
inspection schedule when the tail cone fairing had to be
removed to lubricate the rudder trim chain.
2.1.22(cid:9)
When asked who took the decision to transfer the
fitting from aircraft VT-EJU, he replied that he did not
know the answer. He had not even been aware that the
66

original fitting of VT-EJW had been rejected. It could not
have been at A & C level. An appropriate level may have
been Shri V.C.M Kutty, Chief Manager Engineering or Shri
S.B Gokhale, Off. General Manager Engineering.
2.1.23(cid:9) While deposing before the Committee on 10.9.98,
Shri Anurag Yadav, AME (Cat.A licence) stated (Exhibit
No.46) that he had not known anything about the removal of
the fitting. He had gone to Agati for a month on temporary
posting. Regarding the 300 hrs inspection schedule at Agati
on 21.7.98, he stated that the tail cone had been removed
to grease and to lubricate the rudder trim chain. After
removal of the tail cone, he had inspected that area and
had found no abnormalities. Regarding checks to be done
during daily inspection, he stated that he had checked the
aircraft. He had checked full and free movement of the
elevator control and had also checked for any radial play
of the stabilizer bearing. On 30.7.98, he had carried out
all the checks at Agati.
2.1.24 From the foregoing, it became clear to the
Committee that the THS actuator attachment bearing support
fitting had been removed for ECI during rebuild of VT-EJW.
When the fitting failed the ECI, another fitting was
removed from aircraft VT-EJU and subjected to ECI. After
being declared serviceable, it was installed on VT-EJW.
During installation of the fitting, 10 hi-lok fasteners
were not installed. The fitting was not inspected properly
after installation. On completion of the schedules, the
aircraft was test flown for C of A renewal, which was
renewed on 27.4.98.
67

2.1.25(cid:9)
Shri V. Kashyap, Executive Director, SHOD had
deposed before the Committee on 6.10.98 and the statements
made by him have been enumerated at para 1.18.6. From his
statements it became quite evident that when faced with the
problem of merging Vayudoot with Indian Airlines, senior
management of Indian Airlines overcame the problem by
creating SHOD as
(cid:9)
separate department within Indian
Airlines. This permitted the continuation of the poor work
culture and wrong maintenance practices, which had
prevailed in Vayudoot. Even the maintenance documents, when
examined by the Committee, revealed that some of these
formats still bore the Vayudoot name. Lack of career
progression in SHOD had also lowered the morale of the work
force, which had a detrimental effect on the already
existing poor work culture. Shri Kashyap had stated that
the first maintenance audit by the Directorate General of
Civil Aviation was carried out after the subject accident.
On the other hand Shri Ramesh Dy. Director General of Civil
Aviation who deposed before the Committee on 29.10.98
clarified that at the instance of DGCA Headquarters an
audit of SHOD was carried out by Director of Airworthiness,
Delhi Region in March,98 and the deficiencies were brought
to the notice of the QCM of SHOD. Prior to that also DAW,
Delhi had carried out an audit in Dec.97 at Delhi. Agati
base was checked in July.97 by the Thiruvananthapuram
office. Further DGCA had introduced an internal audit
system by the operators to make them responsible for
adhering to airworthiness standards. DGCA had been carrying
out continuous surveillance checks on the maintenance
activities of SHOD. Shri Ramesh stated that the QCM who was
approved by DGCA was required to shoulder the entire
responsibility of adhering to airworthiness standards as
laid down by DGCA. Shri Kashyap during his deposition had
68

stated that the QCM was reporting to him directly and he
(Shri Kashyap) had met all the officers on a number of
occasions and none of them had brought to his notice any
problem regarding maintenance of the aircraft. When Shri
Bakshi, QCM was questioned about the effectiveness of this
arrangement he said that on several occasions when he took
up engineering problems with Shri Kashyap, he was directed
to Shri Gokhale for a solution. This effectively negated
the effectiveness of independent functioning of the QCM.
2.1.26(cid:9) The Committee could not understand why Indian
Airlines had not introduced changes in SHOD engineering.
Senior level management perhaps failed to appreciate that
safety started at the top. Neither the three monthly
internal audits carried out by SHOD at the behest of DGCA
were effective nor was the response of the management to
the call for corrective action based on DGCA audits
forthcoming. Shri Ramesh during his deposition had also
brought out that a lot more required to be done by the
Airworthiness Directorate to shoulder the responsibilities
entrusted to them. There was an urgent need for additional
manpower as at present the Airworthiness Directorate was
also required to do additional work such as invigilation of
examinations, conducting oral examinations, attending to
VVIP movements and administration, which tied down a big
proportion of manpower and reduced the time available to
carry out meaningful surveillance. Shri Ramesh pointed out
to the Committee that DGCA was functioning with less than
sanctioned manpower. The Committee felt that with
liberalisation of the civil aviation sector in the country
and new operators entering the field with different types
of aircraft, there was a need for additional man power over
69

and above sanctioned levels as DGCA needed to be
strengthened in order to do justice to the surveillance
role.
2.1.27(cid:9)
The Committee visited the maintenance facilities
of SHOD at Delhi on 6.8.98 and observed that the work
culture as well as maintenance practices were not upto
required aeronautical standards. The hangar was littered
with junk, the floor had not been swept and. unserviceable
Dornier 228 aircraft were parked outside in a haphazard
manner. During a subsequent visit to the maintenance
facilities at Delhi on 10.9.98, it was found that the place
had been cleaned up and the Dornier aircraft, which were
parked outside the hangar earlier, had been moved away and
efforts had been made by SHOD to show their maintenance
facilities in better light. The management of SHOD should
have acted earlier on their own, rather than waiting for a
mishap to occur. The top management either lacked the will
to improve maintenance practices at SHOD or were unaware of
what was going on there. Either way, they cannot evade
responsibility for the accident caused by poor aircraft
maintenance practices at SHOD of Indian Airlines.
2.2 Weather :
2.2.1(cid:9)
The weather report issued prior to take-off at
0530 UTC by Duty Met officer INS Garuda, indicated cloudy
weather with visibility as 6 KMs with surface wind as
250/06 kts. Observations recorded at the time of accident
(0535 UTC) did not indicate any deviation from the weather
report issued at 0530 UTC. The crash took place about one
minute after take off and the pilot had also not reported
any abnormality about weather to the ATC. It can therefore
70

be concluded that the weather was not a factor in the
accident.
2.3 Sabotage Aspects :
2.3.1 Office of Commissioner of Security, Civil
Aviation, conducted an inquiry to ascertain whether there
was any sabotage due to lapse of security measures. A firm
conclusion was drawn by them that sabotage was not a cause
of the accident.
2.4 Flight Recorders (CVR & DFR)
2.4.1(cid:9) CVR was replayed at the facilities of the DGCA
office, Delhi. The relevant CVR tape transcript was
prepared from the time the aircraft was cleared for take
off till the aircraft crashed. It was of about 1 min. 07
seconds duration. Analysis of the CVR has revealed that no
abnormality in the voices was detected till the "positive
rate" call out, which was given 40 seconds after the
aircraft was cleared for take off. Six seconds after the
'positive rate' call out, there was an exclamation of "WHO
GAYA AA GAYA" followed by an aural warning which stopped
after 2 seconds. It appeared that the crew experienced some
abnormality as the exclamation "WHO GAYA AA GAYA" was not a
conventional one and not uttered under normal
circumstances. Thereafter, there was an abnormal sound in
the cockpit probably of the head set microphone getting
mechanically disturbed followed by an aural warning (1.025
KHz). At this stage, the aircraft had stalled. As per
Dornier-228 Pilot's Operating Handbook, the continuous non-
mutable acoustic stall warning triggers at 1.0 Khz. The
stall warning remained for 9 seconds and during the stall
71

of the aircraft, the crew headset microphone must have
contacted some part of cockpit giving rise to abnormal
sound as stated above. There was an exclamation of "HARE
RAM HARE RAM" by the Pilot-in-Command 10 seconds before the
crash which was not a conventional one and not uttered
under normal circumstances. It was evident that the
aircraft was totally out of control and the Pilot-in-
Command realizing that a catastrophe was inevitable,
uttered "HARE RAM HARE RAM". Two seconds before the crash,
a Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) aural warning "TOO
LOW" was triggered. The full warning of "TOO LOW PULL UP"
was not heard as the aircraft had crashed by then.
2.4.2(cid:9)
The DFR was decoded at the facilities of VSM
Aerospace, Bangalore. After dismantling the DFR, the
capsule was removed and installed on a serviceable DFR. The
unit was run for nearly 4 hours. However, no useful data
could be obtained. The accident capsule was then installed
back on the unit. A sample check of data on various tracks
revealed that in each track some data on altitude, heading,
and 'g' trace was available with time, which was coupled
with a large number of bad frames. It was observed that no
relevant data was found recorded in it all through 24
hours. There was a cyclic pattern between the bad and
partially good/good data over the 24 hours block. The
precise cause behind the failure of the recorder, in its
recording function, could not be established.
2.4.3(cid:9) Due to non-availability
of data from DFR, the co-
relation of CVR and DFR data could not be done. An
opportunity to obtain a better picture of the flight
profile of the aircraft from take-off till impact was thus
lost.
72

2.5 Circumstances Leading to Uncontrollable Pitch Up
of the Aircraft :
2.5.1(cid:9) As stated in para 2.1.7, while reinstalling the
THS actuator fitting after the ECI, the hi-lok fasteners
(which attach the tang of fitting to the two side brackets
of Frame 34) were not installed. The aircraft was operating
with 10 hi-lok fasteners missing. Dornier confirmed that
operating with 10 hi-lok fasteners missing from the forward
tang of the fitting was possible as long as the trim
actuator tension load did not exceed 300-500 daN. The
aircraft had flown for over 300 hrs with 10 hi-lok
fasteners missing and the fitting had experienced cyclic
loads during operation of the THS actuator. During 300 hrs
inspection, when the tail cone fairing was removed for
lubrication of the rudder trim chain, no sign of damage to
the area around the actuator attachment fitting was
observed by maintenance personnel. During the subsequent 30
hrs of flight, Daily Inspections/Transit checks had not
revealed any structural or control anomalies.
2.5.2 During the take off from Kochi for
Thiruvananthapuram, the THS actuator attachment fitting was
on the verge of tearing away from the web of Frame 34.
During take off, the Pilot-in-Command would have rotated
the aircraft by moving the control column backward thereby
holding on to a pull force. As a normal reaction, the
Pilot-in-Command would have trimmed out the pull force by
blipping the trim switch to move the THS leading edge (LE)
down. As the THS LE moved down, the down load on the THS
and elevator increased, which resulted in a push force on
the actuator attachment bracket on Frame 34. Following gear
73

retraction as the aircraft accelerated, a nose up trim
change would have occurred making the pilot push the
control column slightly forward moving the elevator
trailing edge (TE) down. The pilot would then have held a
push force on column and to release this, he would have
trimmed forward to move the THS LE up, thereby converting
the push force in area of Frame 34 to a pull force. At that
stage of the flight, THS actuator forward attachment
bearing support fitting on Fra:e 34 bulkhead suddenly tore
loose partially. Partial detachment of the above fitting
resulted in an increase in arm length of the actuator
thereby moving the THS LE down. This caused the initial
pitch up. Normal pilot reaction to the pitch up would have
been to push the control column forward, which moved the
elevator trailing edge down creating a upward force at the
end of the THS/elevator surface. Due to the location of the
hinge line and the centre of pressure of the THS, the
upward force rotated the THS LE further down to a minimum
of 14° thus reversing the effect of elevator control. The
resulting pitch up to a near vertical attitude could not be
controlled by the pilot using full elevator deflection
available to him. This reconstruction of sequence of events
was made by the Committee in consultations with experts
from Dornier.
2.6 Pilot Factor :
2.6.1(cid:9)
Capt. S.R. Singh held a valid ALTP licence
(No.1979). The licence had a Pilot-in-Command endorsement
on Dornier-228 aircraft. He had a total experience of over
5400 hrs, out of which over 4800 hrs were on Dornier-228
aircraft. Capt. Manish Sharma held a valid ALTP licence
(No.2104) which had a Co-pilot endorsement on DO-228
74

aircraft. He had a total experience of over 2300 hrs, out
of which 930 hrs were on Dornier 228 aircraft. Both were
found medically fit during their last medical examination.
2.6.2 Prior to departure of the flight to
Thiruvananthapuram on 30.7.98, the Pilot-in-Command had
carried out a preflight inspection schedule at Kochi. After
the aircraft was cleared for take off by the ATC, the crew
carried out the required check list and during the take off
standard call outs were made and found recorded during
replay of the CVR. After take off, the aircraft attained a
height of approx. 400' and then suddenly pitched up to a
near vertical attitude. The Pilot-in-Command was unable to
control the aircraft with the elevator available to him.
2.6.3 Dornier with whose representatives the accident
scenario had been discussed by the Committee during their
visit to Mumbai, stated that a sudden mistrim of 14° from
trimmed flight could not be counteracted by elevator
control regardless of control forces, which would be
required. Even with optimum effort a pitch up could not
have been avoided. The pitch up led to a load factor
estimated at 2 'g'. An uncontrolled increase of angle of
climb was the consequence with rapid decrease of speed.
Rapid decrease of air speed caused the aircraft to stall
and fall on its right side. No piloting errors were made.
Pilot error was not a contributory factor to the accident.
2.7 Organisational Aspects :
2.7.1(cid:9) Shri V.C. Mathoo Kutty, while deposing before the
Committee on 10.9.98 stated (Exhibit No.47), he was a
regular employee of SHOD, IA and had been absorbed from the

erstwhile Vayudoot along with other employees. He held AME
licence covering Dornier DO-228 aircraft in the Categories
'A', 'C' and 'i' apart from 'X' on DR and RR Compasses. .He
stated that he was mainly involved in administration and
when demanded maintenance. On being asked who had given
orders for removal of the fitting from Frame 34 of VT-EJW
for NDT and subsequent installation, he stated that he was
not aware and added that it was the sole responsibility of
the person, Shri V.K. Srivastava, who had certified the
work after removal, installation and inspection. He stated
that for carrying out special jobs involving riveting and
deriveting, Shri Srivastava had been approved and was
directed to carry out the job by the QCM. He said Shri
Srivastava was handling the despatch. of items to other
stations and used to get items removed from various
aircraft without his (Shri Kutty's) knowledge or consent.
He stated that the engineers themselves used to voluntarily
make job allocations on various systems and whenever there
was a serious problem, they used to come to him. He also
stated that Shri Srivastava and Shri Bakshi were directly
tasked by Shri S.B. Gokhale, offg. GM (Engg) regarding the
jobs to be done and they were not in the habit of informing
him. Shri Gokhale used to hold meetings in Shri
Srivastava's room or in Shri Bakshi's room. He was never
consulted or informed. However, whenever there was a
serious problem, not under his (Shri Gokhale's) control, he
(Shri Gokhale) used to engage him (Shri Mathoo Kutty).
2.7.2(cid:9)
Deposing before the Committee on 10.9.98 (Exhibit
No.48) and 6.10.98 (Exhibit No.49), Shri S.B. Gokhale
stated that in 1993 the Govt. had decided that Vayudoot be
merged with Indian Airlines. Indian Airlines management had
asked him to revamp the maintenance of DO-228 aircraft. He
76

had been working as Offg. General Manager (Engg) since 1994
and looking after the newly created Short Haul Operations
Department (SHOD) of IA. Regarding the steps taken by him
to monitor actual work in SHOD, he stated that his job was
basically to put the right people at the right place. He
used to visit the hangar twice a week. He believed
maintenance people knew how to do their job properly.
Therefore, he concentrated more on the areas of material
support, PPC etc. They used to meet in Shri Kutty's office.
In those meetings, Shri Kutty never mentioned the existence
of any serious problems but he used to ask for additional
facilities to be provided in the hangar. On being asked
whether non-availability of the stabilizer trim actuator
fitting on Frame 34, had ever been discussed at their
meetings, he replied in the negative and stated that Shri
V.K. Srivastava was looking after rotable control and
material management. Even though Wg. Cdr. Yadav was in-
charge of PPC, he usually studied the capital requirements,
preparation of budget and arrangement for calibration of
equipment etc. Regarding the total break down of the
maintenance system in SHOD he stated that when there was no
basic discipline, there was hardly anything a G.M could do.
Everybody got full attendance and overtime. Whatever
responsibility was given to him, he tried to discharge the
same to the best of his ability. May be he had not
succeeded and may be he should have been more vigilant. All
managers in-charge of various sections were expected to
discharge their duties and the organisation could not
expect everything to be done by one person.
From the deposition of various officials, it was
2.7.3(cid:9)
evident that laid down maintenance procedures were not
being followed in SHOD. The THS actuator attachment bearing
77

support fitting had been removed from VT-EJW and nobody
knew who had ordered the removal of the fitting. Right from
the level of foreman Shri Sher Singh to the level of Chief
Managers (Engg) (S/Shri V.C.M.Kutty, V.K. Srivastava, and
O.K. Bakshi) and at the higher level of Off. GM (Engg)
(Shri S.B. Gokhale), nobody knew who had issued
instructions to remove and reinstall the fitting. Though
there was a transfer register maintained for entering items
removed/installed from one aircraft to another, no entry
pertaining to the removal/installation of the above fitting
had been made in the transfer r
-gister.
2.7.4 The Committee was convinced that partial
detachment of the THS actuator attachment fitting was
caused due non-
installation of 10 hi-lok fasteners. Verbal
instructions were given to Shri Sher Singh for removal and
installation of the fitting. Shri V.K. Srivastava, who
finally certified the installation was not approved for the
job at the time of removal and installation of the fitting.
Therefore he did not supervise the removal and
installation. He normally looked after PPC functions and
was brought in to certify structural jobs under approval
from DGCA as qualified and experienced engineers were not
available in maintenance. When the original fitting failed
ECI, a replacement fitting was not available in the stores.
Therefore instead of ordering a new fitting, one was
removed from another aircraft VT-EJU. The above fitting had
24 fastener holes. It was very unlikely that all the
fastener holes on the fitting removed from VT-EJU would
have matched within SRM limits to the existing holes on the
structure of VT-EJW. During the course of the Committee's
discussion with experts from Dornier, they opined that the
fitting in question was not jig aligned. The transfer of
78

(cid:9)(cid:9)
the fitting from one aircraft to another could result in
mismatch of installation holes. Hence they did not
recommend a transfer. 'D' rivets and hi-lok fasteners
required for installation were not available in stores.
Therefore the(cid:9) fasteners were picked up from left over
spares from an earlier structural job undertaken by
technicians from Dornier. Fasteners were chosen by
comparing their dimensions. A transfer of an item from one
aircraft to another was required to be entered in the
Transfer of Components (TC) register. This procedure was
also not adhered to. There was a considerable time gap
between removal and re-installation of the fitting. This
along with non-availability of the required attachment
parts must have contributed to the non-installation of the
hi-lok fasteners on the fitting.
2.7.5(cid:9) Since Shri Srivastava was not involved at the
time of removal and installation of the fitting, probably
he was not fully aware of the shape and the attachment
requirement of the fitting. By certifying a fitting which
was already installed, he could not have ensured proper
matching of holes within SRM limits and also installation
of the correct fasteners as per the requirement.
2.7.6(cid:9) From the evidence gathered from the statements of
the staff and executives in SHOD, the Committee was
convinced there were serious inter-personal differences
existing within the Engineering management cadre of SHOD.
Shri Kutty who was incharge of maintenance deposed before
the Committee that work was being carried out on the
aircraft without his knowledge or instructions. He had
issued a Staff notice in the year 1997 advising engineers
to refrain from undertaking such jobs without his
79

clearance. However, the Committee felt that the same
situation persisted even at the time of the accident. Shri
Bakshi, QCM who was required to detect and prevent any
deviation from required maintenance procedures, claimed no
knowledge of the work being carried out on the aircraft.
Regarding the replacement of the THS fitting on VT-EJW he
stated that QC came to know about the same only after the
wreckage inspection at Kochi. Shri Gokhale, who was deputed
to SHOD from Indian Airlines as Offg.GM did not succeed in
making any improvement in the poor work culture which
existed in SHOD. Shri Kutty who was supposed to supervise
day-to-day maintenance activities had concentrated more on
administration by his own admission. Shri Gokhale as
incharge of SHOD engineering was not able to rectify the
situation but made it worse by bypassing Shri Kutty and
dealing with his subordinates and colleagues directly in
matters connected with maintenance of aircraft.
2.7.7(cid:9)
From the foregoing it was apparent that :
2.7.8(cid:9)
Shri Sher Singh, Foreman appointed on contract
undertook work without proper written instructions. He
failed to complete the work started by him and advised Shri
V.K. Srivastava wrongly about work completion. He also
signed for completion of the work without physically
checking it.
2.7.9(cid:9)
Shri V.K. Srivastava was negligent and undertook
certification of work carried out without his supervision.
He carried out the inspection in a perfunctory manner and
failed to notice the absence of 10 hi-lok fasteners. He
relied on the assurance of Shri Sher Singh that the work
has been completed and certified the same.
80

(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)
2.7.10(cid:9) Shri O.K. Bakshi did not exercise proper quality
control on maintenance activities. He did not ensure proper
documentation of the work undertaken. Mandatory internal
audits did not detect and correct deviations from
Airworthiness requirements.
2.7.11(cid:9) Shri V.C.M. Kutty as the officer in-charge of
maintenance did not assert his right to control maintenance
activities within his jurisdiction. Instead he put his
views down in writing and kept himself aloof from day-to-
day maintenance activities.
2.7.12(cid:9) Shri S.B. Gokhale as offg. General Manager in-
charge of SHOD engineering failed to ensure observance of
correct maintenance practices in SHOD. He also failed to
create an effective team at SHOD engineering.
2.7.13 The Committee came to a unanimous and firm
conclusion that poor maintenance practices which existed at
SHOD significantly contributed to the errors committed by
individuals Shri Sher Singh and Shri Srivastava and finally
led to the accident.
2.7.14(cid:9) The primary concern of senior management of an
airline should be the safety of fare paying passengers. It
is an accepted norm in airline management the world over
that air safety starts at the top. An abiding interest in
safety matters demonstrated by the senior management will
send the right message down the line to the work force. In
today's complex world of aviation some top managers use
intractable labour problems as an excuse not to adequately
address air safety issues. They leave them to be addressed
81

(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)
by personnel at the floor level.(cid:9)
This was the case at
SHOD. Shri V. Kashyap the Executive Director of SHOD failed
to establish a suitable feed back mechanism to effectively
monitor the activities of the engineering department and
arrest falling standards of maintenance in time.

82

(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)
3.1.8(cid:9) Standard ATC procedures were followed and ATC was
not considered a factor in the accident.
3.1.9(cid:9) The aircraft had not suffered a bird strike after
its take off from Kochi.
3.1.10 There was no evidence of in-flight fire.
3.1.11(cid:9) Both engines were developing power at the time of
impact.
3.1.12(cid:9) The DFR did not record any useful data as its
recording function was defective.
WHAT HAPPENED
3.1.13(cid:9) On the morning of 30.7.98, the aircraft arrived
at Kochi from Agati and no snag was reported by the Pilot-
in-Command.
3.1.14(cid:9) The aircraft was refuelled with 600 lbs of fuel
to make a fuel state of 1600 lbs for the flight from Kochi
to Thiruvananthapuram.
3.1.15(cid:9) Pre-flight inspection schedule was carried out by
the technician and Pilot-in-Command.
3.1.16(cid:9) The flight crew carried out appropriate check
lists and the aircraft took off for Thiruvananthapuram with
six persons on board.
83

(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)
3.1.17(cid:9)
The take off was normal and the aircraft attained
a height of approx. 400 ft.
3.1.18(cid:9)
The aircraft suddenly pitched up to a near
vertical attitude.
3.1.19(cid:9)
No R/T transmissions were made by the aircraft to
the ATC after it pitched up.
3.1.20(cid:9)
The aircraft stalled, fell to the right and
crashed on the roof of the Component Repair Shop (CRS)
building of the Naval Aircraft Yard NAY(K), Kochi.
3.1.21(cid:9)
After impact with the CRS building, the aircraft
caught fire and was completely destroyed.
3.1.22(cid:9)
All six persons on board and three persons on the
ground received fatal injuries.
3.1.23 Fire fighting and rescue operations had started
without any delay and no deficiencies were observed in the
performance of these services.
HOW IT HAPPENED
(Reconstructed by the Committee in consultation with
experts from Dornier Luftfahrt GmbH)
3.1.24(cid:9)
During take off, the Pilot-in-Command rotated the
aircraft by moving the control column backward thereby
holding on to a pull force.
84

(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)
3.1.25 As a normal reaction, the Pilot-in-Command
trimmed out the pull force by blipping the trim switch to
move the THS leading edge (LE) down.
3.1.26 As the THS LE moved down, the down load on the THS
and elevator increased, which resulted in a push force on
the actuator attachment fitting on Frame 34.
3.1.27 Following gear retraction as the aircraft
accelerated, to counter the nose up trim change the Pilot-
in-Command pushed the control column slightly forward
moving the elevator trailing edge (T.E) down.
3.1.28(cid:9) To trim out this push force, the Pilot-in-Command
trimmed forward to move the THS LE up, thereby converting
the push force in area of Frame 34 to a pull force.
3.1.29 At that stage of flight, the THS actuator forward
attachment bearing support fitting on Frame 34 bulkhead
suddenly tore loose partially.
3.1.30(cid:9) Partial detachment of the above fitting resulted
in an increase in the arm length of the actuator moving the
THS LE down.
3.1.31(cid:9) Movement of the THS LE down resulted in the
initial pitch up of the aircraft.
85

(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)
3.1.32(cid:9) Pitch up of the aircraft at that stage prompted
the Pilot-in-Command to push the control column forward,
which moved the elevator TE down creating an upward force
at the rear end of the THS/elevator surface.
3.1.33(cid:9) Considering the location of the hinge line and
the centre of pressure of the THS, the upward force rotated
the THS LE further down to 14°.
3.1.34(cid:9) Such a large movement of the THS LE downwards
caused the violent pitch up to a near vertical attitude,
which the pilot-in-command was unable to control with the
elevator available to him.
3.1.35(cid:9) Consequent rapid decrease of air speed caused the
aircraft to stall and fall on its right side.
WHY IT HAPPENED
3.1.36(cid:9) THS actuator forward attachment bearing support
fitting was removed for ECI during which it was found that
it had excessive pitting and was therefore rejected.
3.1.37 Since a new fitting was not available in stores, a
fitting of the same part no. was removed from another
aircraft VT-EJU and installed on VT-EJW after subjecting it
to ECI.
3.1.38(cid:9) During reinstallation of the fitting qty. 10 hi-
lok fasteners attaching the longitudinal tang of the
fitting to the Frame 34 structure were not installed.
86

(cid:9)(cid:9)
3.1.39(cid:9) The foreman who signed for the job completion did
not physically check the completion of the job.
3.1.40 The Chief Manager (Engineering), duly approved for
the job, certified the installation of the fitting after
checking the installation from the rear face of the fitting
only. He failed to inspect the fitting for the presence of
10 hi-lok fasteners which were required to be installed to
attach the longitudinal tang of the fitting to the Frame 34
structure.
3.1.41(cid:9) After about 300 hrs of flight following fitting
replacement, cyclic loading on the fitting resulted in
cracking of Frame 34 bulkhead web along the right side
rivet line under the rear face of the fitting.
3.1.42 The pull force on the THS actuator during nose down
trimming of the aircraft resulted in partial detachment of
the fitting from the web of Frame 34 bulkhead.
3.1.43 Maintenance procedures, documentation and work
practices that existed at SHOD of Indian Airlines were
unsatisfactory and did not meet the requirements of an
approved aircraft maintenance organisation.
3.1.44 These poor maintenance practices at SHOD
significantly contributed to the errors committed by the
persons who carried out the installation of the THS
fitting, which finally led to the accident.
87

(cid:9)(cid:9)
3.1.45 Quality Control Manager Chief Manager In-charge of
maintenance, Offg. General Manager (Engg) and Executive
Director of SHOD did not take effective steps to arrest the
falling standards of maintenance in time.
3.1.46 Non-availability of sufficient spare parts in the
stores resulted in frequent cannibalization from other
aircraft.
(cid:9)
3.1.47 Subsequent to the Government decision to merge
Vayudoot with Indian Airlines, senior management Indian
Airlines, when faced with problems of effecting a complete
merger, created SHOD within Indian Airlines. This permitted
the continuation of the poor work culture and wrong
maintenance practices which had earlier prevailed in
Vayudoot.
3.1.48 Lack of career progression in SHOD had lowered the
morale of the work force at SHOD, which had a detrimental
effect on the already poor work culture.
3.1.49(cid:9) Oversight of SHOD maintenance activities by the
regulatory authority could not produce the desired
corrective effect as the internal audits carried out by
SHOD at the behest of DGCA were ineffective. The
management's response to the call for corrective action
based on DGCA audits was not forthcoming in some cases and
not prompt in 'others.
88

3.2 Cause of the Accident :
After take off the aircraft pitched up
uncontrollably, stalled, fell to its right and crashed. The
uncontrollable pitch up was caused by sudden uncommanded
downward movement of the Trimmable Horizontal Stabilizer
leading edge. This was due to partial detachment of its
actuator forward bearing support fitting due non-
installation of required hi-lok fasteners.
Poor aircraft maintenance practices at Short Haul
Operations Department contributed to the accident.
4. Recommendations :
4.1 Short Haul Operations Department (SHOD) of Indian
Airlines should be brought under the Quality Control system
of Indian Airlines and all the documentation and
maintenance practices should be standardised.
4.2(cid:9) Since the lack of career progression 1-1;,d a
demoralising effect on the work force, a time bound
programme should be initiated to disband the SHOD and fully
integrate the same with Indian Airlines.
4.3 Indian Airlines should take stringent measures to make
internal safety audits of SHOD more effective and
discrepancies noticed should be acted upon immediately.
4.4 Indian Airlines should improve the spares support to
Dornier aircraft operations.
89

(cid:9)(cid:9)
4.5(cid:9) Indian Airlines should monitor the flight recorders
and ensure that these remained fully serviceable.
4.6(cid:9) Drawing upon the experience of the unhappy merger of
Vayudoot with Indian Airlines, in future, while re-
structuring organisations dealing with aircraft operations
and maintenance, the highest priority should be given to
Air Safety.
4.7 In view of new airline operators entering the Civil
Aviation sector in the post liberalization era, DGCA needs
to be strengthened for effective airworthiness
surveillance.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
1.
The Govt. of India appointed me as the Chairman of
an Inquiry Committee constituted to investigate the
accident involving Indian Airlines Dornier 228 aircraft
VT-EJW on 30.7.98 at Kochi vide Notification
No.AV.15013/3/98-SSV
dated 1.8.98. Shri Babu Peter,
General Manager (Engineering), Air India, Capt. I.D.
Singh, Air India were appointed Members with Shri Subhash
Chander, Director Air Safety, Civil Aviation Department,
Mumbai as Member Secretary. The investigative task was
complex and challenging. The help, assistance and co-

circles. His vast knowledge of aircraft maintenance
procedures, mature judgement and wisdom were of immense
value. He was the technical pillar of the Committee.
Capt. I.D Singh's considerable flying experience on the
Dornier 228 made him a veritable gold mine of information
on flying and aircraft systems. Without his contribution
much of the Committee's time would have been lost in
trying to gain an insight into these aspects. Shri
Subhash Chander performed his onerous task as Member
Secretary with great enthusiasm and indefatigable energy.
To him goes the credit for superb co-ordination and

staff work. All three members maintained an unfailingly
Cheerful disposition during the Committee's sittings and
made working with them a real pleasure.
4. I must thank the Managing Director, Air India for
his assistance in providing a comfortable room at the Air
India Complex, Old Airport, Mumbai for use of the
