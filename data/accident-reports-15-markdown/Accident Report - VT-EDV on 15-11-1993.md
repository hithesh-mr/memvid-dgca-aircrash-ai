_ INTRODUCTION
_ 11 On 15th November 1993, Indian Airlines Flight IC-440 took off from
Madras for Hyderabad at about 0615 hours. The type of aircraft was |
Airbus A-300 B2. There were 12 crew members and 250 passengers on
_ board. Capt. R.P. Bhalla was in command.
| 1.2 The estimated flying time to Hyderabad was 46 minutes. The
designated diversionary airfield was the same as the place of departure,
i.e. Madras. The requirement of fuel for the flight, including reserves
for diversion and contingencies plus 30 minutes of holding, was 14.7
tonnes. The actual quantity of fuel taken was 16.0 tonnes which
_ corresponded to an airborne endurance of 2 hours and 20 minutes.
13 On that day, the weather forecast for Hyderabad for the period 0330-
. 1130 hours indicated a visibility of 10 kms reducing temporarily to
3000 metres in mist during 0530-0930 hours. However, according to
actual weather reports, the visibility reduced to 2000 metres at 0640
hours, 1500 metres at 0645 hours, 500 metres at 0655 hours and 200
metres at 0710 hours. Thereafter, it improved to 1200 metres by 0810
= hours. | | )

- 14 Flight IC-440 made one approach for landing at Hyderabad. Being
unable to sight the runway at decision height, its Commander carried |
out a go-around at about 0705 hours. However, the aircraft's flaps
failed to retract from the fully extended position. Being unsuccessful

in efforts to free the flaps from their jammed condition, and on finding
: out that the visibility at two nearby Air Force airfields (Air Force
3 ,

Academy and Hakimpet) was even worse than at Hyderabad, the
Commander decided to divert to Madras. Due to the aircraft's flaps
| being stuck in the fully extended position, its indicated airspeed had
to be limited to a maximum of 180 knots. Flying in this configuration
ata height of 15000-17000 feet a.m.s.l., there was a significant increase
in the aircraft's fuel consumption. Further enquiries were made by the :
aircraft about the visibility at Hyderabad and its likely trend but, .
finding the information to be not encouraging, the Commander
continued to proceed towards Madras. -
| 1.5 The aircraft had indicated its estimated time of arrival at Madras as
0820 hours. At about 0809 hours, the Commander decided to proceed
to Tirupati airfield as he found the aircraft’s remaining fuel to be
insufficient for making it to Madras. He sought assistance from Madras
Control in navigating the aircraft to Tirupati and this was duly
| provided. However, with very little fuel left in the aircraft's fuel tanks,
| the aircraft was force-landed at about 0825 hours in some paddy fields
about 26 kms short of Tirupati airfield. |
1.6 The nose-wheel of the aircraft broke away almost immediately after
contacting the ground. The aircraft decelerated rapidly due to the _
friction created by the nose section of the fuselage with the ground. -
Soon after it came to rest, all occupants were evacuated safely. There
was no fire. With the exception of 8 occupants, all others were unhurt.
No one was injured on the ground. ,

FACTUAL INFORMATION
2.1 History of Flight
2.1.1 On 15th November 1993, Indian Airlines Airbus A-300 aircraft |
registration no. VI-EDV was scheduled to operate Flight
IC-440 (Madras-Hyderabad-Delhi) under the command of Capt
R.P. Bhalla. The flight departed Madras for Hyderabad on
| schedule.
} 2.1.2 The crew of the aircraft had been given meteorological and
communication briefing at Madras for both sectors of the flight.
For the Madras-Hyderabad sector, Madras had been designated
| as alternate airfield of landing.
2.1.3 Take off from Madras was at about 0618 hours. The aircraft's
first contact with Hyderabad Tower was at 0108 hours UTC,
when it was asked by the ATC to monitor airfield information.
- At 0114.hours UTC, the aircraft requested descent clearance to
FL 280 when it reported 97 DME from Hyderabad. It was cleared
to FL 100 and given the visibility as 2000 metres. About three
7 minutes later, at 0117 hours UTC, the latest visibility of 1500
metres was intimated to the aircraft. At 0124 hours UTC, when
- the alrcraft reported 25 DME from Hyderabad, it was cleared to
4400 feet on QNH 1015 and it was vectored for ILS approach
, for runway 27. About two minutes later, at 0126 hours UTC,
| the ATC gave the latest visibility as 500 metres which was
acknowledged by the aircraft. At 0127 hours UTC, the request
| of the aircraft to descend to 3300 feet was not approved by the
5

ATC and the aircraft was asked to check its minima. In response, |
the aircraft intimated its intention to make one approach. At ,
0129 hours UTC, the aircraft reported over HY locator and again
requested clearance to descend to 3300 feet. While according ,
| this clearance, the ATC asked the aricraft to report when
established on the localiser and once again the aricraft was asked
to check its minima. At 0130 hours UTC, the aircraft asked for
| the RVR and the ATC replied that the vehicle was proceeding |
to Runway 27 for taking RVR. At 0132 hours UTC, the aircraft
reported established on localizer and the ATC informed it that
. RVR for Runway 09 was 240 metres. When the aircraft reported
over the outer marker, the ATC asked it to descend to MDA ;
and report runway visual. The aircraft reported going around
at 0135 hours UTC and, upon being asked by the ATC aboutits
intention, asked for the weather trend. This was given as ‘no
significant change’. The aircraft enquired how long the weather ,
) | was likely to remain unchanged and, at 0137 hours UTC, this
was piven as half an hour. The ATC again asked for the pilot's _
intention. At 0139 hours UTC, the aircraft informed that it was
(joining HHY hold. Almost immeditely thereafter, it informed
the ATC that it was having some problem with its flaps and it r
would call back again. |
| 2.1.4 At0140 hours UTC, the ATC gave the RVR for Runway 27 as
: 240 metres which was acknowledged by the aircraft. At 0142
hours UTC, the aircraft informed the ATC that it was diverting
| to Madras. At 0150 hours UTC, the aircraft asked for the latest
visibility and RVR which were given as 200 metres and 240

metres respectively. On further enquiry by the aircraft about
the trend, the ATC said that visibility was expected to become
1500 metres in mist by 0210 hours UTC. At 0151 hours UTC,
the aircraft asked if any Air Force Station was reporting better
visibility than Hyderabad. About 9 minutes later, at 0200 hours
UTC, it was informed that the visibility at Air Force Academy
and Hakimpet was 50 metres and 100 metres respectively. At
| 0152 hours UTC, the aircraft reported its positioin as 43 nm out
" of Hyderabad and it requested another visibility check as it
| was having a technical problem with its flaps stuck in the down
_ position and cruising speed limited to 165 knots and that it was
on marginal fuel for Madras. This message was acknowledged
by the ATC. About three minutes later, the ATC informed the
aircraft that the visibility was 500 metres and the runway lights
were not available. This was acknowledged by the aircraft.
2.1.5 At 0202 hours UTC, Hyderabad ATC asked the aircraft about
_ its endurance. The aircraft gave this as one hour, reported —
80 nm out of Hyderabad, and gave its ETA Madras as 0250
hours UTC. While acknowledging this message, the ATC asked
the aircraft to confirm if it would be able to make upto Madras.
| The aircraft replied “Will try”. At 0212 hours UTC, when the
. aircraft reported 105 DME from Ilyderabad, the ATC asked the
} aircraft that it still had to go another 185 miles and to confirm
that it would be able to reach Madras. The aircraft replied
‘Affirmative’. _
2.1.6 The aircraft’s first contact with Madras Control was at 0221
hours UTC, when it reported 140 DME out of Hyderabad.
7

Madras Control enquired about its endurance which was given
as about 35 minutes. At 0226 hours UTC, the aircraft informed
Madras Control that it was on radial 333 from Madras at FL 170
and 136 DME from Madras. At 0239 hours UTC, the aircraft
was identified on Madras radar when it was 100 nm from
_ Madras. At this stage, the aircraft requested Madras Control to
get Tirupati airport operational and it indicated its intention of
making an approach there. At 0241 hours UTC, the aircraft |
asked for the heading to Tirupati from its position at that time. /
Immediately thereafter, the aircraft informed “No way I can
make it to Madras, On low fuel, I have to make to Tirupati, that
is evident, 40 miles can glide into Tirupati if you could
cooperate.” Madras ATC gave the aircraft its heading as 171
degrees to Tirupati and also gave the length of Tirupati runway
as 4500 feet. At 0245 hours UTC, upon an enquiry from the
aircraft, the ATC informed that it was approximately 32 miles
from Tirupati and the heading to Tirupati was 166 degrees.
2.1.7 At0249 hours UTC, when the aircraft was 30 miles from Tirupati |
on a bearing of 355 degrees, it gave its endurance as 5 minutes.
In reply to an enquiry from the ATC, the aircraft reported .
passing 3000 feet height and said that it did not have Tirupati |
airfield in sight. From 0252 hours UTC, the aircraft could not |
communicate with Madras Control. It made an RT transmission
asking any station to relay to Madras and obtain its distance to
Tirupati. This message was picked up by Flight IC-439 which
relayed it to Madras Control and obtained information that
IC-440 was 29 miles from Tirupati on a bearing of 345 degrees.
| 8

This message was intimated to and acknowledged by IC-440.
At 0254 hours UTC, Madras control lost radar contact with
Flight IC-440. It asked IC-439 which was flying in that area to
try to raise IC-440. At 0330 hours UTC, Flight IC-439 informed
Madras Control that 440 was on the ground in paddy fields
; near Tirupati and everything was safe.
| | 2.1.8 Flight IC-440 force-landed at 03:55:19 hours UTC in paddy fields
about 14 nm due north of Tirupati. Ground marks indicated
| that the aircraft’s nose wheel collapsed almost immediately after
| touch-down. Due to high friction of the front fuselage with the
ground, it decelrated rapidly and came to a stop within 1400
feet. All passengers and the crew members came out of the —_-
- aircraft safely after it came to a halt. Evacuation was mostly
| carried out by means of escape chutes except from No. 1R door
where several persons jumped out as the escape chute did not
deploy and the sill height had diminished due to the collapse of
nose landing gear.
2.1.9 An airborne search was launched soon after the accident. A
7 | Naval helicopter was the first to reach the site of the accident. _
. Presently, an IAF helicopter with para-medical team landed
’ there. and rendered first aid. It also airlifted the personnel
requiring medical treatment to Bangalore. Others were taken to
Tirupati by helicopter/bus.

METHOD OF INVESTIGATION
3.1 This formal investigation was ordered by the Government of India,
| Ministry of Civil Aviation and Tourism, under Rule 75 of the Aircraft
Rules 1937, vide notification number AV.15013/17/93-SSV dated 23rd
| November 1993. A copy of the same is placed at Annexure ‘K’ and ‘L’.
The procedure adopted by me for carrying out the investigation is
briefly stated below:— |
a) Rule 75 of the Aircraft Rules 1937 stipulates that the Court shall
) hold the investigation in such manner and in such conditions as
the Court may think fit for ascertaining the circumstances of the
accident and for enabling the Court to make its report. Thus, the |

nature of my task was quasi judicial, and I was free to choose the
method which was best suited for fulfilling my mandate. I could
| oblain information for my investigation from all sources and make
use of it without being fettered or hindered by the rigidity of the
| procedures which govern proceedings in Courts. This
understanding is in full conformity with the ruling of the Supreme
Court (case no. AIR 1963, SC 365) on the scope of such inquiries
a - as also with the procedures followed during the investigation of

some earlier accidents. _ |

b) It is also stipulated in the said Rule 75, and spelt out in the above-

mentioned ruling of the supreme court, that all affected parties
must be given a fair opportunjty to explain their conduct if any
| information is to be made use of against them. This was duly

: complied with. |
21

c) Throughout the investigation, I and my assessors were guided by
the objective of aircraft accident investigation as given in ICAO
Annexure 13, i.e. “The fundamental objective of the investigation
of an accident or incident shall be the prevention of accidents and _
incidents. 1t is not the purpose of this activity to apportion blame
) or liability”. However, this did not mean that we would turn a
blind eye to any mistakes made by people which may have caused
the accident or contributed towards its occurrence. To do so would :
have negated the very purpose of our investigation because, unless :
we could establish the wrong actions which led to the accident,
we could not suggest any preventive measures for the future.
| : Thus our general approach may be summed up by saying that we
| were determined to find out everything which was relevant to the
accident but we were not so much interested in “who did it” as |
we were keen to ascertain “why it happened”. Our comments in
this report on the errors of individuals and deficiencies in
organizations are not intended'to suggest any punitive action but
to focus attention on areas needing preventive measures in the
interests of Flight Safety.
3.2 Immediately upon being appointed to conduct this formal investigation, .
I had a meeting with the Director General of Civil Aviation who had .
been designated as the authority for making administrative
arrangements for the Court’s functioning. He informed me that, on
| the day of the accident, Mr. K. Gohain had been appointed as the
Inspector of Accidents under Rule 71 of the Aircraft Rules 1937. He
briefed me on the progress made by Mr. Gohain and sought my
directions on whether the Inspector's investigation should be continued
22

or not. I informed him that it should continue but I stipulated a target
date for his report to be finalised. 1 also indicated some specific areas
to be probed.
3.3 My meeting with the DGCA was immediately followed by a briefing
) of tentative technical findings of the Inspector of Accidents as well as
represetatives of the aircraft manufacturer (i.e. Airbus Industrie) and
) _ flap system manufacturer (i.e. Lucas Aerospace).
} 3.4 Thereafter, my assessors joined me and we visited the accident site
near Tirupati for a thorough inspection of all relevant material evidence.
We made use of this visit to stop over in Hyderabad for discussions
with officers of the Central Training Establishment of Indian Airlines,
and for carrying out simulations of the ill-fated flight’s configuration
in the A-300 simulator. In addition, this visit gave us a first-hand
acquaintance with the ATC and meteorological facilities at Hyderabad
airport. |
3.5 I gota public notification issued on 6th December 1993 inviting persons
| having personal knowledge of the causes or circumstances of the
. accident to make such knowledge available to the Court. A copy of
the same is placed at Annexure ‘M’. In addition, interested parties like
” Indian Airlines, National Airports Authority, Airbus Industrie, Lucas
Aerospace, India Meteorological Department, Indian Commercial Pilots’
Association, Air Traffic Controllers’ Guild (India) and the Association
| of Flight Engineers were specifically offered the opportunity to be
admitted as interested parties in our proceedings. With the exception
of the ICPA and the AFE, all of them accepted the offer. : |
23

3.6 Whilst continuing the process of sifting all material evidence which
had a bearing on the accident, persons having direct knowledge of the
accident’s circumstances were asked to appear before the Court and to
give their evidence. Legal representatives of the interested parties were
called on 17th December 1993 and briefed on the following general
lines:— |
(a) The report of the Inspector of Accidents, which had become
available by then, was supplied to them along with statements — 7 |
of some persons connected with the accident and a list of the
witnesses summoned. They were informed that further relevant
material would also be supplied to them as it became available.
(b) The interested parties could suggest the summoning of more
witnesses and, if their relevance to our investigation was
established, such witnesses would be summoned.
(c) They could submit affidavits to indicate the basic position of
their clients on any aspect concerning the accident.
(d) The procedure of examining and cross-examining of witnesses
was explained to them. 7
(e) After the hearings, they would be given the opportunity to make
) final written submissions as well as to present oral arguments to
refute the written submissions of other parties.
3.7 Shortly before our public hearings were due to begin, one of my
assessors had to be replaced due to unavoidable reasons. This
24

necessitated a short delay to acquaint the new assessor with the details
| of all the work done by us till then.
3.8 A list of all the witnesses examined by us is placed at Annexure ‘N’.
3.9 The open sittings of the Court commenced on 17th January and these
_ concluded with the oral arguments of all interested parties on 16th |
- February 1994.

| ANALYSIS
4.1 General
4.1.1 All factual information about the ill-fated flight has already
been detailed in an earlier part of this report. In this part, an
effort is being made to analyse that information along with the
relevant documentary evidence, oral evidence and other material
presented before us or collected by us.
4.2 Weather Minima
4.2.1 It has been brought out in para 2.1.3 that, just before Flight IC- co
| 440 commenced its ILS approach for landing at Hyderabad, it
was apprised by the ATC that the latest visibility was reported
: as 500 metres. Since the weather minima applicable to this flight
was a visibility of 800 metres, and it was noi faced with any
.. emergency, it was not permissible for the pilot to make an
approach under the circumstances. In this context, para 1.38.5
of Indian Airlines Operations Manual, Volume I, refers and the
same is reproduced below:-
“Prohibition of Landing Below Minima |
All operations below the filed minima are strictly prohibited. |
- Noaircraft shall commence or continue an approach to landing |
at an airfield if the reported visibility/RVR is below minima. -
Landing below the minima is only permissible in an emergency.
In such cases a report shall be made to the DO/OM within 24 ;
hours.” .
4.2.2 Various parties produced evidence or presented their arguments |
before us whether the action of the aircraft's Commander in
26

making an approach for landing at Ilyderabad under the given
circumstances was justified or not and whether this action on
his part was a cause of the accident or not. In his own forthright
and candid testimony before us, Capt R.P. Bhalla explained
| among other things that :-
a) Reduced visibility at Ilyderabad airport in the morning
during winter is not uncommon.
b) It had been his experience during numerous flights on
Madras-Hyderabad-Delhi sector that, on such occasions
of reported low visibility at Hyderabad, the actual
_ Observed visibility is generally much better than the
reported visibility. This is especially so on the approach
of Runway 27,
c) The areas affected by reduced visibility are variable due
to moving patches of fog.
d) To make an approach in low visibility upto the decision
. height is not dangerous or against his company’s interest.
e) Stipulations in the Rule Book do not hold good at all
times. If we go by the Rule Book, we would not be able to
land on so many occasions.
4.2.3. Counsel for NAA produced before us an extract from the
submissions made by the ICPA before Mr. M.R. Srivaraman, |
27

DGCA, in 1992/93 for arbitration of the dispute between the
ICPA and Indian Airlines. The same is reproduced below:-
| “In Para 1.38.0 Aerodrome Operating Minima has been
elaborately laid down and filed with National Airports
- Authority. In this instance again, the Airline has again fulfilled
the requirements of complying with the regulations in the books
but no effort is made to understand the logic behind the |
regulations and enforcing their compliance. Meteorological
minima is seen by IA as impeding “on time performance”. Pilots |
are not discouraged from below minima operations just to ensure
“on time” departures and arrivals. The biggest offender in this
regard are the Senior Pilots by which we mean Director of
Operations, Regional Directors, Operations Managers and
Examiners. Instead of setting high standards and good examples,
| their unprofessional behaviour in this regard is perceived as a
very high risk factor.” .
| 4.2.4 The statement of Capt. Bhalla was indicative that this was not
an isolated or solitary occasion on which he had attempted to
land in visibility conditions below his weather minima. The .
| material presented by Counsel for NAA showed that similar
violations are made by other pilots also, including senior .
Executive Officers of Indian Airlines. In an effort to determine
the reality, we questioned officers from the Training/
Operations/ Air Safety departments of Indian Airlines. All of
: them confirmed the rule position on the subject ie. strict
adherance to the applicable weather minima and no scope for
28

any deviation from it except in an emergency. They also
confirmed that if any violation of the weather minima comes to
light, appropriate corrective action is taken as deemed necessary
in each case. Usually, this is in the form of extra refresher
training. We tried to ascertain the incidence of weather minima
violations and the possibility that some such cases might be
going undetected or unrecorded. We found that the NAA has
placed a responsibility on their ATC officers to report every
infringement of the weather minima to their higher authorities
| and the DGCA. However, no such responsibility has been
enjoined by Indian Airlines on any of their officers. They have
established an elaborate mechanism for monitoring and
controlling their flights viz. designated Operations Controllers,
Deputy Managers Flight Operations, Assistant Managers Flight
Operatigns and Flight Operations Officers. This mechanism can
be easily utilised, if desired, to monitor the occurrence of weather
minima violations but this is not being done. Indian Airlines
reacts to such violations only if these are brought to its notice
by the NAA or the DGCA.
} 4.2.5 From all the information that we could gather, we were not left
| in any doubt that:- |
a) Violations of veather minima by Pilots of Indian Airlines
do take place.
b) There is no effective mechanism at present to ensure that
every such case is positively detected by the Airline. _
29

c) Evenif any case of weather minima is detected, the action
taken is unsuccessful in curbing the tendency for such
violations. _
4.2.6 At this stage, it is advisable to exainine the importance of
weather minima, the consequences of its violation and the
responsibility for the present state of affairs. The weather minima
is a set of weather conditions adopted by every operator of civil .
aircraft in India, and approved by the DGCA, below which
flying operations are not permitted except in an emergency. It
is based upon an assessment of the degree to which the safety '
of flying is affected during approach and landing by the
limitations of the landing aids available, aircraft performance
and airfield peculiarities. It is clearly and unmistakebly intended
to enhance flight safety by prohibiting any deliberate or
inadvertent excursion into the realm of known safety hazards
in a very critical phase of flying unless there is an emergency in
which the pilot may take a conscious decision to ignore it.
However, it is not a line beyond which every intruder will face
definite disaster. It is only a line beyond which the operator has
chosen not to run any unwarranted risk. It is incumbent upon
every pilot to scrupulously observe his weather minima for the |
following reasons:- -
a) To ignore such a well-considered limitation and to put
the safety of the aircraft, along with that of its occupants,
| in joepardy is utterly irresponsible and foolhardy.
30

b) Non-compliance with clear standing orders of the operator
is an act of indiscipline.

4.2.7 It follows from the foregoing that the direct consequence of

violating the weather minima is a reduction in the margin of

| safely. Pilots who indulge in such violations know this very

well but they tend to think that their superior skill or their vast

| experience or their familiarity with the airfield’s approaches etc
will make up for this. These factors are indeed very important

| and these do offer a considerable shield of protection to the
pilot which is quite effective most of the time. However, while
such protection can save them most of the time, it cannot do so

always. This is because, some day, something else may also go

wrong and then there might be no safe way out from their

difficulties because of the compounded reduction in the margin

of safety.

4.2.8 In every phase of flying, flight safety can be achieved only by

the efficient and coordinated functioning of several agencies.

For instance, during an instrument approach in marginal

. weather conditions, safety depends upon the pilot being
| properly trained and mentally alert, his crew rendering full

oo assistance in accordance with standard operating procedures, —

the aircraft equipment functioning correctly, the pilot observing

his weather minima, the Meteorological Office providing correct
weather information, the ATCO providing correct information /

clearance, ground landing aids/lighting systems functioning

correctly etc etc. If each one of these agencies works to perfection,

310

as it is expected to do, not only is a safe approach ensured but
there is also a reasonable safety margin to cater for any
| unexpected occurrence. However, if any of these inputs are
defective or deficient, the margin of safety is reduced and
accident proneness results. lt would be absurd for anyone to
perform his duties inefficiently or indifferently in the hope that
his deficiency would be made up by full and proper inputs
from others concerned. To do so would inevitably impair the
marign of sefety in day-to-day flying operations. This should
be prevented by the fullest professional involvement of everyone |
‘who is engaged in these activities as well as by those who have
a monitoring or controlling function over such persons.
4.2.9 In the aforersaid submissions of ICPA, it has been said that
; violations of the weather.minima are not discouraged for
ensuring “on time” departures and arrivals, and that the biggest
offender in this regard are senior pilots. Here it must be said
that while “on time” performance is undoubtedly very important
for an airline, it should be achieved solely by enhanced efficiency
and never by compromising flight safety e.g. by turning a blind
eye towards the possibility of, or towards actual instances of,
the infringement of weather minima. |
4.2.10 We can now address the question of Capt. Bhalla’s justification
| for making an approach that day in weather conditions below
his minima, the degree of his responsibility in this respect and
the corrective action required. As brought out above, the rules |
on the strict observance of weather minima need to be
implemented implicitly in every single approach. No laxity or
| 32

liberty in this regard can be condoned, and we find no acceptable
justification for Capt Bhalla’s decision to make an approach in
below-minima conditions. However, we do not believe that the
responsibility for his action lies only with him. It seems to us
that he is only one of the weak links in the chain. Every such
weak link has to be strengthened if the objectives of light safety
are to be achieved. Our considered view is that the present
unsatisfactory state of affairs has come about due to managerial
. laxity over several years. The responsibility for this lies squarely
with the senior officers of the Operations Department of Indian
Airlines. They have allowed a situation to be reached in which
weather minimas are not adhered to scrupulously and no
worthwhile effort is made to detect and prevent instances of
weather minima infringement. The operations Manual of Indian
Airlines does contain a sound policy on the subject, but a good
policy by itself is not enough. There must also be the will and
the ability to enforce it. This is not the case at present. It is |
imperative that the Airline should evolve a fully effective
mechanism to ensure that there is no violation of its own policy
in the observance of weather minimas. Unless this is done, a
. serious flight safety hazard will continue to exist. In specific
| terms, the Airline should:-
a) Inculcate in the minds of their pilots a better
understanding of the reasons for stipulating weather
minimas and the consequences of violating these.
b) Institute an effective in-house mechanism to detect each
and every infringement of the weather minima. (Flight
33

Operations Officers could be charged specifically with the
duty of reporting every such case. Besides, whenever
weather conditions in any region or any airport are known
or expected to be marginal, the designated Operational
Controllers/Flight Managers should particularly watch out
for instances of weather minima violation.)

c) Take very firm and deterrent action against violators of
weather minima, especially if they hold any position of !
high responsibility in the Airline. ,

4.3 Role of Flight IC-916
a 4.3.1 We must make a mention here of the role played by Flight
IC-916 in the approach made by Capt Bhalla in below-minima —
conditions. To understand this better, the following relevant
information has been extracted from the ATC tape transcript:-
| (a) <At0111 hours UTC, the ATC gave approval to Fit. IC-916 |
to start engines and informed that visibility was 2000
metres. |
b) At 0117 UTC, when Flight IC-916 was taxying to the a
runway, ATC informed that latest visibility was 1500 ,
metres. : |
7 (c) At0120 hours UTC, Flight IC-916 took off for Bangalore.
34

d) At0125 hours UTC, the ATC informed Flight IC-440 that
latest reported visibility was 500 metres. At 0126 hours
UTC, Flight IC-440 asked the ATC for the visibility as
observed from the Flying Control. The ATC replied
“Visibility is very poor, Sir. All the appruaches are being
covered.” Immediately thereafter, Flight IC-916 called
Flight IC-440 and said “IC-916 calling IC-440, go ahead
sir, 09 side is better. 27 the patch of fog was moving.”
Flight IC-440 acknowledged this message and thanked
Flight IC-916.
(f) At0127 hours UTC, the ATC asked Flight IC-440 to check
his minima. Flight IC-440 replied to say “We will make
One approach.”

4.3.2 In his testimony before us, Capt Bhalla stated that his decision
to make an approach was based partly on the information given
by Flight IC-916 that the visibility on runway 09 was better and
that thé patch of fog on 27 was moving. While we are unable to

~ condone Capt Bhalla’s action of making a below-minima

| approach in spite of this input from Flight IC-916, we want to
| highlight that, though the information volunteered by Flight
7 IC-916 was obviously well-intentioned, it was actually
unwarranted and utterly ill-conceived. It was well known to

Flight IC-916 that the reported visibility had been deteriorating

very rapidly as it was 2000 metres at 0111 hours UTC, 1500

metres at 0117 hours UTC, and 500 metres at 0126 hours UTC.

It was most imprudent for Flight IC-916 to offer advice on the

35

basis of the visibility which had been observed at 0120 hours
UTC duing its take-off because that had become redundant in
the light of significant subsequent events at 0125/0126 hours
UTC viz. latest meterological report of visibility being 500 metres
and the ATC’s observation from the Control Tower that
“Visibility is very poor, Sir. All the approaches are being
covered.” Worse still, there can be no justification whatsoever
for Flight IC-916 to encourage IC-440 to make an approach in
below-minima conditions by saying “Go ahead, Sir, ....”,
knowing fully well that the reported visibility was below the
stipulated weather minima. °
4.3.3 Incidently, this message from IC-916 to Flight IC-440 is indicative
that IA pilots show scant regard to the observation of stipulated
weather minimas. In this context, our conclusion in para 4.2.5
(a) also refers. | |
4.3.4 In bringing out the foregoing, it is not our intention to blame
~ the Commander of Flight 1C-916 in any way or to suggest that
- exchange of weather or traffic information between aircraft
should be prohibited. We are quite aware that at times such |
communications can be very important and useful. However, |
pilots should be careful to ensure that information passed by "
them to other aircraft is not based upon redundant parameters
and that it is clearly in furtherance of Flight Safety. While the
communication of Flight IC-916 in this case was unwarranted
and absolutely injudicious, it would be perfectly in order and
in fact advisable for an aircraft which has just landed to inform
36

\ a
another aircraft on the approach (directly or through the ATC)
about the presence of wind-shear or fluctuations in ILS
indications etc if any. |

| 4.4.1 Soon after going around, the Commander of Flight 1C-440
discovered that the aircraft’s flaps were stuck in the fully
extended posilion. He ordered the flaps to be recycled but this
did not help in any way. The flaps continued to remain stuck at
25 degrees but the slats responded correctly to all movements
of the Flap-Slat lever. He was now faced with a rather unusual
situation in that :-

(a) The weather at Hyderabad was far below his minima and

he had just inade an unsuccessful approach there.
(b) With the flaps stuck in the fully extended position, further
flight would have to be restricted to a maximum IAS of
180 knots and it would not be possible to climb upto
normal cruising altitude. In consequence of these factors,
he knew that the aircraft’s fuel consumption would be
; _ much higher than normal. However, he had no reference
“f available from which he could find out the best range
speed and the absolute range of the aircraft in thal

configuration.

— 44.2 From an examination of DFDR tape and the statements of the
crew, we observed that the jamming of the flaps was not noticed
by them for some time initially. Even after they discovered it,

37

the maximum permissible IAS of 180 knots was exceeded for
about eight minutes in spite of the clacker warning having
sounded. We cannot help commenting that undue delay in
detecting the flap jam does little credit to the performace of the
First Officer and ‘light Engineer who are required to monitor
all flap movements. Similarly, the prolonged speed exceedance
does little credit to the performance of the Commander who
should promptly have reduced the speed to less than 180 knots
when the flaps were found to be stuck and the clacker sounded.
However, we do not intend to labour further on these points |
because these factors did not have any effect on the rest of the a
} flight and especially on the chances of freeing the jammed flaps.
Instead, we intend to anaiyse two issues which are of crucial
importance to our investigation and which attracted a great
deal of interest from all parties in our proceedings. These are :- |
(a) Capt Bhalla’s decision to divert to Madras under the given
Circumstances.
(b) Flight management during the diversion.
4.5.1 Capt Bhalla was questioned by all parties in detail about the "
reasons for his diversion to Madras and about other oplions
which were available to him. In general, he explained that he
had asked for the weather trend for Hyderabad airport. Initially,
he was advised that the low visibility was likely to last for
about half an hour but later this was revised to one hour. He
| 38 |

also enquired from the ATC if any Air Force airfields were
reporting better visibility than Hyderabad. In response, he was
given the visibility of Air Force Academy and Hakimpet which

was worse than that at Hyderabad. Thus, the area affected by

fog that morning seemed to be quile widespread. He said that,

in view of this, holding over Hyderabad would have been a

very questionable decision and in fact it would have been bad

airmanship on his part. He added that he had “no regrets about
. his decision against holding over Hyderabad. Neither then, nor
now”. Regarding the advisability of diverting to Bidar, he said
" that he did not specifically ask for the weather at that place as
the fog seemed to be quire widespread and Bidar was also

likely to be affected by it. However, in answer to a question

later, he said that if Bidar weather had been given to him by the

ATC, and if the visibility there had been satisfactory, he could

have diverted there. He emphatically rejected the option of using

“auto-land” at Hyderabad saying that he had little confidence

in the use of this facility because ILS equipment at most Indian

airports is not sufficiently dependable and that, if he was ever

confronted with a situation in which a landing had to be made

| in very poor visibility, he would prefer to carry out a manual

| ILS approach and visual landing rather than an auto landing.

a He also said that he did not doubt that.a diversion to Madras

was possible as ‘initial calculations made by his crew indicated

that there would be 1.4 tonnes of fuel on board at TOD for

Madras. However, as the flight progressed, this was revised to

1.2 tonnes and 1.0 tonnes before it was realised that Madras

could not be reached at all. Regarding a possible diversion to

39
| é

Vijaywada when he was about 80-100 nm out of Hyderabad, he
said that there was no doubt at that stage about reaching Madras.
Besides, he added, Vijaywada is not suitable because it is
virtually an unmanned airfield since Indian Airlines stopped
operating there and, being near a river and the sea, ther would
be the possibility of fog. Besides, there were chances of people _
in fishing villages being killed on the ground in the event of a
forced landing in that area.

4.5.2 Before any comment can be passed on the decision of Capt

Bhalla to divert to Madras, it is advisable to examine all the
options which were available to him at that time. Broadly
speaking, these were:-
(a) Diversion to the designated diversionary airfield ice.
| Madras.
(b) Holding over Hyderabad.
(c) Diversion to some other suitable airfield.
(d) Declaration of an emergency. (This could be done in
addition to any of the aforesaid options).

4.5.3 The general policy of Indian Airlines on flight diversions is that
the alternate airports to be used for diversions are specified in
the Navigation Flight Plan but, with due regard to the
considerations of fuel on board and weather, the Commander

40

may divert to any suitable airfield if in his opinion it is prudent
to do so. (Para 1.29.0 of Indian Airlines Opertaions Manual, |
Volume I, refers). In the case of IC-440, the flaps got stuck in
the fully extended position. It was evident to the Commander
~ that in this configuration, the aircraft's fuel consumption would
increase due to the extra drag, lower. speed and lower flight
| level. The exact extent of such increased fuel consumption was
neither known to him from his past experience and training,
| nor was it given in the flight manuals/documents carried on
. board. However, before committing himself to a diversion to
Madras, it was imperative for him to be sure that the available
fuel would be sufficient for that trip in spite of the increased
fuel consumption due to jammed flaps. If such an assurance
could.not be obtained somehow, the proposed diversion would
be clearly hazardous as it would entail the risk of running out
of fuel during the flight. Without such assurance, it would be
most imprudent to set course for Madras unless:-
(a) It was a tentative course of action by which the adequacy
or inadequacy of fuel was intended to be confirmed by
, actual navigational observations for a short period of say
.. 5-10 minutes at the chosen flight level after which this
option would be confirmed or revised, and
(b) It could be ensured that at least one out of the other viable
options would not be joepardised while the above-
mentioned observations were being made.
4)

4.5.4 If the flight was to hold over Fyderabad, the crucial factor to
consider was the expected duration of low visibility due to fog.
In response to an inquiry from the aircraft, the ATC had said at
0130 hours UTC that the Met. Office expected this to be half an
hour. In response to another enquiry, the aircraft was informed
at 0137 hours UTC that this would be one hour. In response to
yet another enquiry about the weather trend, the aircraft was ,
informed at 0150 hours UTC that the trend was “visibility
| becoming 1500 metres in mist” by 0210 hours UTC. Based upon
all these inputs, the visibility could be expected to improve
sufficiently for a normal landing to be made by about 0210-
0240 hours UTC. However, if the aircraft had decided to hold
overhead and the visibility did not actually improve sufficiently,
there would be no choice but to make an auto-landing in below-
nunima conditions.
4.5.5 Any decision to divert to an airfield other than the designated
diversionary airfield would have to be with due regard to its
distance from Hyderabad, prevalent weather and facilities
available. In comparison to Madras, there are four suitable
airfields which are located much nearer to Hyderabad. These 7
include three Air Force airfields viz. Dundigul (Air Force .
Academy), Hakimpet and Bidar which are in regular use and
which are at approximate distances of 17 nm, 6 nm and 61 nm
respectively from Hyderabad. The fourth is the civil airfield at
Vijaywada which is 144 nm from Hyderabad but its watch hours
are irregular as no scheduled services Operate from there at
present. After encountering the flap jam, Flight IC-440 had asked
42

Hyderabad at 0151 hours UTC “Is any Air Force Station
reporting better visibility than yours”. In response, it was given
at 0200 hours UTC the visibility figures of Academy and
Hakimpet which were even worse than that at Hyderabad. The
ATC did not convey the visibility of Bidar and, when this was
not provided, the aircraft did not ask for it specifically. This
: was very unfortunate because Academy and Hakimpet are very
close to Hyderabad and, therefore, these were likely to be
. affected by local fog whereas Bidar was far away and likely to
be unaffected by it. Our investigations confirmed that the
visibility in Bidar was significantly better than at Hyderabad as
reflected in the below:-

| 4.5.6 Regarding the declaration of an emergency by the aircraft,
especially if it were to hold over Hyderabad or if it were to
divert to an airfield other than Madras, we are quite aware that
pilots are generally reluctant to take such a step due to their
| apprehension that it may give an impression that they are no |
longer in control of the situation. However, it is not difficult to
see that any such reluctance is quite unwarranted and against
their own interest. The declaration of an emergency would
immediately attract greater involvement of the ATCO and the
FOO in the search for a solution and/or useful information. We
are of the view that, if an unusual or uncertain situation is
encountered in flight, the pilot would generally stand to gain
an advantage by informing the ATC unambiguously that he is
«in. an emergency.
4.5.7 We visited the Central Training Establishment of Indian Airlines
to see at first-hand the facilities and methods used for the basic “
and refresher courses for pilots. Later in our proceedings, we
had the occasion to question at length Capt S.N. Reddy, Director
of Training (Operations) in the CTE. He is a highly experienced
pilot, instructor and examiner on A-300 aircraft. He was very -
frank and forthright in telling us about the policies/ practices of -
flying training for normal procedures as well as emergency
procedures. We asked him what a pilot should do, based upon
his training, in the circumstances which Capt Bhalla had faced
in flight IC-440. He told us that every A-300 pilot (including
Capt Bhalla) carries out during initial training as well as during
44 .

every refresher course one auto-landing in the simulator in a
simulated visibility condition of about 100-metres. This
experience is expected to enable the pilot to carry out an auto-
landing confidently if he is faced with an emergency and the
visibility is very low. He said that, if he were in the situation in
which Capt Bhalla was placed, he would hold over Hyderabad
. in the expectation of the visibility improving, as it was bound
. to do, but if this did not happen he would have gone ahead
; with an auto-landing without any hesitation. He also said that
. an auto-landing approach is always more stable and accurate
because of inputs from two autopilots instead of one. He was
questioned further about what he would do if he had already
set course for Madras and then discovered that the fuel was
insufficient for reaching there. He said that this was a purely
hypothetical proposition and the answer depends upon the
aircraft's position at the time of discovering the inadequacy of |
fuel. However, in any such case, he would calculate his range
and divert to the most suitable airfield within that distance. We
“found all his answers to be well-reasoned, logical and
convincing. We are also very satisfied with what we saw of |
. flying training in the CTE.
a
4.5.8 Having considered all the options which were available to Capt
Bhalla, we can now address the validity of his decision to divert
to Madras. As in all such cases, it was his prerogative to take
: such actions as he deemed to be best under the circumstances.
However, it is necessary that his actions should be analysed
objectively and constructively to derive suitable lessons forthe
45

_ i}
enhancement of flight safety. We tried our best to visualise, as
realistically as possible, the circumstances in which Capt Bhalla
was placed. Ile was over a fog-bound airport and the aircraft's
flaps were jammed in the fully extended position. There was no
difficulty in flying or controlling the aircraft but its indicated
airspeed had to be maintained below the limit of 180 knots. It
was evident that under these parameters, the aircraft's range as ,
well as endurance would be substantially curtailed but the exact
extent of such curtailment was not known. Nor were the best
, speeds for range and endurance known. In these circumstances,
the most critical factors were the limited time for which the
available fuel could sustain the aircraft's flight and the limited
distance to which it could be flown. It was essential to choose
a course of action which would enable a safe landing to be | |
made within the limits of these factors. The only practical way
. _ to ascertain whether Madras was within reach or not was to fly
towards it fora few minutes and to make accurate navigational
calculations. However, this had to be done without jeopardising
at least one out of the other viable options and, if the calculations
indicated that Madras was not within reach, it would be essential
to revise the chosen course of action immediately. "
| | ‘
45.9 From all available evidence, it is abundantly clear to us that at
no stage did Capt Bhalla establish that the available fuel would
be adequate for reaching Madras. He was in doubt-about it at
the very outset, and his doubts kept increasing as the flight
progressed. This is also confirmed by the fact that, even after he
had set course for Madras, he inquired if any Air Force Station
46

was having better visibility than Hyderabad and he made
repeated inquiries about the latest visibility/weather trend at
Hyderabad. We believe that the possibility of diverting to Bidar
_ had not occurred to him and it is a pity that he discarded the
option of holding over Hyderabad followed by an auto-landing
| if necessary. Worst of all, he failed to appreciate the futility of
pressing on towards Madras when the available indications were
| that Madras was clearly beyond reach but it was still possible
lo divert to Vijaywada or to return to Hyderabad. Even when
} the ATC asked him at 0204 hours UTC, “Confirm you will be
able to make upto Madras”, he failed to assess the criticality of
the situation and eventually he made a forced landing at 0255
| hours when the aircraft nearly ran out of fuel.
4.6 Flight Management during Diversion

46.1 In every diverted flight, fuel conservation is very important
and it is advisable to fly at the Mach No./IAS corresponding to
_ Maximum range. As against this, if it becomes necessary to
hold over an airfield for an extended period of time, this is

done at the speed for maximum endurance. Pilots are taught all

. the basics of the theory applicable to range flying and endurance
flying.

” 4.6.2 When Capt Bhalla diverted from Hyderabad to Madras, there
were good reasons for him to be seriously concerned about the
fuel state and to try and fly the aircraft for maximum range. In
this context, we had been surprised to read in his written
statements to the Inspector of Accidents dated 15 November
1993 and 26/27 November 1993 respectively “Initially the speed

47

of around 170 knots was maintained. However, keeping in view “
the very high fuel consumption, speed was reduced to 132-135
kts for better endurance” and “At about 80 miles out of
Hyderabad, I decided to for range and maximum endurance...” In
answer to our questions about his understanding of range flying
| : and endurance flying, he said in his testimony before us that
there was no great importance to range flying as the difference
| is very small. We were astonished and concerned at such a
response. We consider it very important for airline. pilots to ,

_ Clearly understand the principles of range flying and endurance |
flying and to implement these at appropriate times during their
flying.

4.6.3 Notwithstanding the foregoing, Flight IC-440 was in an unusual
7 configuration due to its flap jam and there was no ready -
: reference of the best range speed in that configuration. Capt
Bhalla climbed to 15000/17000 feet and chose a speed of about
165 kts IAS. This was a very good choice under the -
circumstances. The DFDR analysis of the entire diverted flight
| shows that the highest figure of nm per tonne of fuel was
obtained as long as this speed was maintained. However, Capt a
Bhalla would have got still better results if he had retracted the }
slats which were kept mostly at 20 degrees and, for as much as "
about 35 minutes, at 25 degrees. It is well known that slats, like
flaps, reduce the lift:drag ratio and thus the aircraft's range. In
, simulations on the A-300 simulator, we found that by retracting
the slats a fuel-saving of over 10 per cent could have been
, achieved in Flight IC-440’s diversion towards Madras. While |
this would not have been enough to stretch the aircraft's range
48

upto Madras, we have no doubt that Tirupati airfield could
have been reached very safely. |
4.6.4 We were unable to find any acceptable reason for Capt Bhalla
to reduce the aircraft's speed from 165 knots IAS to about 135
knots during the diversion. Even when this was done, he ought
} to have realised in a very short time that this was worse, rather
than better, for the aircraft's range. He reduced the speed when
the aircraft was about 80 nm out of Hyderabad. In his testimony
, before us, he said that did so for the sake of staying closer to
Hyderabad to facilitate a return in case the weather improved.
| We do not believe that he was telling the truth when he said
this but, if he was, this was certainly a very irrational action on
his part.
4.6.5 Let us now take a look at the flight planning and navigation
: during the diversion of Flight IC-440. After the accident, the
Inspector of Accidents had found no flight Engineers’ log or
record of fuel calculations in the aircraft. We were very anxious
to learn why this diversion had been persisted with in spite of
| very doubtful adequacy of fuel. In our proceedings, the
| . Commander, the First Officer and the Flight Engineer were all
: questioned at length by all interested parties. We discovered
that the First Officer and the Flight Engineer had played the
main role in determining the adequacy of fuel for the diversion.
Neither of them had kept any written record of their calculations.
Of the two, the Flight Engineer gave us very precise figures of
time, position and fuel contents, and he seemed to be very sure
of these. However, on further questioning, he said that these
49

were not based upon any real-time written record but on his
| recollection from memory two days after the event. Both of
them said that their initial calculations indicated that they would |
_ make Madras with a fuel state of 1.4 tonnes at TOD 50 nm short
of Madras, but, as the time went by, the situation kept changing
slowly for the worse until they realised at a distance of about
136 nm out of Hyderabad that it was impossible to reach Madras.
We reconstructed the fuel state from the DFDR data and the ,
ATC tape transcript and we found the following: -
: Time ~ Position Fuel Contents Distance
(a) 0135 UTC Going Round 10.4 tonnes 285 nm
(b) 0152 UTC 43 nm from 7.15 tonnes 242 nm
Hyderabad
(c) 0203 UTC 80nm from 5.86 tonnes 180 nm
Hyderabad ,
(d) 0212UTC 105 nm from 4.71 tonnes 180 nm |
Hyderabad
| (ey) 0215 UTC 115 nm from 4.37 tonnes 170 nm
, Hyderabad "
(f) 0223UTC 140nmfrom — 3.43 tonnes 145 nm "
_ Hyderabad ,
4.6.6 From the foregoing, we feel that it should have been clear at a
very early stage in this flight, and definitely by the time the
_ aircraft was 80 nm out of Hyderabad, that the available fuel. ,
was just not sufficient for reaching Madras. The First Officer
50

and the Flight Engineer were not only callous in carrying out
their respective duties of navigation and fuel calculations but
they displayed a high degree of incompetence as well. Instead
of being an asset to the Commander, they proved to be liabilities.
While the Commander cannot be absolved of his own lapses
and his overall responsibility, professional conduct and timely
advice by either of these two officers could easily have saved
. this accident.
| 4.7 The Forced Landing
4.7.1 If a forced landing becomes inevitable, and if time permits,
certain important actions are required to be taken by the aircraft's |
crew. These are listed in the aircraft Check List. In our
proceedings, the Flight Crew as well as some members of the
Cabin Crew were questioned by various interested parties about
these actions. It was quite evident, and it was not contested by
anyone to the contrary, that sufficient time had been available
| for carrying our these actions.
4.7.2 From the responses of the crew, we were surprised to discover |
° that some of actions which are listed in the Check List for forced
| > landing, and even some of the normal procedures, were not
carried out at all. This reflects adversely on the Commander of
the aircraft and on the training standards of simulated
emergency drills in Indian Airlines. Our observations are as
follows:- |
| (a) The Flight Crew of Flight IC-440 conveyed to Madras
Control at about 0239 hours UTC (i.e. about 16-17 minutes
5]

before the forced landing) their intention of proceeding to
Tirupati. However, no such intimation was given at any
| stage to the Cabin Crew or to the passengers. Right until
the forced landing, they remained under the impression
that they were returning to Madras. 7
(b) The alrcraft commenced its descent from FL 170 without .
any permission from, or intimation to, the ATC.
(c) The Cabin Crew were not informed about the impending .
forced landing and to prepare the passengers for it. In the
absence of such preparation, it is not possible for
passengers to adopt the appropriate posture to minimise
the chances of injury during forced landing. The Flight
| Crew said that this had done deliberately to avoid any
panic among passengers. We totally disapprove of this
kind of ill-advised departure from well-considered
practices which are included in the Check List for implicit
compliance. :
(d) After the aircraft came to rest, no notification or direction .
was given by the Flight Crew to the Cabin Crew to initiate *
the evacuation of passengers.
4.7.3 We also wish to make a few general observations about the
| forced landing. These are:- ,
(a) Out of the very few choices available, the Commander
52

selected a very good spot and a very good alignment for
the forced landing. ,

(b) DEFDR data indicates that the Commander maneouvred
the aircraft very skillfully while making last-minute
adjustments in his approach. The touch-down was very

, well-controlled and fairly gentle.
(c) The landing gear was lowered too late. It locked in the
. down position only 4 seconds before touch down.
(d) In spite of there being no prior intimation or subsequent
- direction from the Cockpit Crew, the Cabin Crew
performed well and generally gave a good account of
themselves in the evacuation and care of passengers after
the forced landing.
4.8 Role of ATC
4.8.1 In all flight operations, and especially during periods of bad
weather, the ATC plays a very important role. We shall now
examine how the ATC performed in respect of Flight IC-440.
7 4.8.2 Before Flight IC-440 commenced its ILS approach at Hyderabad,
the visibility had reduced to 500 metres. In such conditions,
there used to be until June 1993 a very long-standing practice
that the ATCO had to ask the aircraft to “check his minima’.
This used to be a polite reminder to the pilot to continue the
approach only with due regard to the applicable weather
minima. However, in the light of certain violations of the weather
3

minima, it was decided to modify this procedure. Consequently,
with the intention of exerting a stronger influence on the pilot
in such cases and to eliminate any misunderstanding of weather
: information, a revised instruction was issued by the National
Airports Authority vide DARA circular No. 6 of 1993 dated
25th June 1993. This brought about a more stringent procedure
whereby whenever the RVR/ visibility is 2000 metres or less, .
arriving aircraft are required to “report their minima” instead of -
“checking their minima”. Further, if the RVR/Vvisibility is less ‘
than the minima, they are to be asked for their intention. In
: - case they express the intention to land, they are to be given
conditional clearances to approach and to land (according to a |
stipulated format). Further, this occurence is to be logged as
well as reported to the Member (Ops) NAA and to the DGCA.
A copy of the said revised instruction is placed at Annexure ‘P’.
4.8.3 From a scrutiny of the ATC tape transcript, we found that the
duty officer had used the old and redundant procedure instead
of the new revised procedure. We questioned him if he was
aware of the new instruction and he confirmed that he was. We
asked him why he did not follow it. There was no satisfactory a
explanation from him. ‘We asked him if he knew or if he had oo
been able to discern the reason for the issue of the revised
instruction. His answers were vague and meaningless. Later,
Counsel for NAA in his submissions argued that, though the oo
new instruction had not been complied with in letter, its
intended purpose had been served substantially. We are unable
to accept this contention. In our view, this failure to use the
54 |

revised procedure reflects very poorly on the performance of
the concerned officer, especially since this was in spite of full
awareness of the revised instructions. Equally, it is a sad
reflection on his superiors for their failure to ensure that such
instructions are understood and complied with by all concerned.
' 4.8.4 One of the issues which attracted a great deal of interest during
| our proceedings was that the ATC had not provided to the
, aircraft the visibility of Bidar airfield when it had been asked if
any Air Force station was reporting better visibility than
Hyderabad. From the log books maintained in the ATC, we
found that there were entries to confirm that the visibility at —
Air Force Academy and Hakimpet had been ascertained and |
recorded, but in respect of Bidar there was an entry of “NRH”
i.e. no response heard. In view of this, it was contended by the
NAA and the ATC Guild that an attempt had been made to
obtain the visibility at Bidar but it was unsuccessful. Others
argued that, under the circumstances, more attempts should
have been made directly as well as through Hakimpet. In any
ease, the aircraft should have been informed that Bidar could
. not be contacted by telephone. Had this been done, the aircraft
" might have called up Bidar directly on R/T. These arguments
led to assertions that the ATC seemed to have played a
somewhat passive role without the expected degree of
involvement as envisioned in one of the objectives of Air Traffic
Services in ICAO Annexure 11 para 2.2 (d) ie. “To provide
advice and information useful for the safe and efficient conduct
of flights.” In response to this, it was argued that the ATC has |
a)

no responsibility for generating weather information and that it
acts only as the communicator of such information if and when
the same is supplied /available. It was also said that, since Bidar
is an Air Force airfield, its weather is not routinely pased to or
readily accessible at Hyderabad which is a civil airport. —
4.8.5 We have applied our minds in detail to these lines of reasoning
with due regard to the principles and recommendations in ICAO .
Annexure 11. As a result, we have no hesitation in saying that
the request of the aircraft for the visibility at Air Force stations .
was perfectly valid and the ATC was fully duty-bound to obtain
it. Considering the bad weather and the flap jam faced by the
aircraft, this should have been done with speed and diligence.
In reality, only a casual and feeble attempt was made. The ATCO |
apparently failed to appreciate that this was a not a routine ,
enquiry but it indicated the aircraft's desire to abandon its just-
, notified intention to divert to Madras in favour of a suitable
place to land nearby. It also indicated the Commander’s
willingness to use an Air Force airfield in spite of the commonly
known and obvious lack of requisite ground handling facilities
there. Since Academy and Hakimpet were found to be unusable "
| due to poor visibility, Bidar was the only airfield of interest in os
the context of the aircraft's enquiry. It is a common practice for
ATCQOs to use alternate means of communication when the
primary means fail to evoke a response. It was well known to
the ATCO that Bidar’s visibility could have been obtained not
only on their direct telephone to Bidar ATC but through their
direct telephone lines to Academy ATC and Hakimpet ATC
also. In any case, the aircraft should have been informed if
56

Bidar’s weather was not obtainable. |
4.8.6 In our proceedings, there was considerable discussion of whether
the ATCO could not assess from the aircraft's transmissions
that it would be unable to reach Madras and whether the aircraft
should not have been advised very clearly in this respect. After |
assessing all relevant evidence, we are satisfied that the ATCO
| showed sufficient anticipation and concern in this regard and
no further action in this respect was called for.
4.8.7, We found from the ATC tape transcript and the ATCOs log
| book that runway lights at Hyderabad were not available
_ between 0715 hours and 0743 hours. During our proceedings, it
was brought out that the approach lights had also gone off
: during this period. We found that, to cater for the contingency
of power failure, a stand-by generator has been provided to
, operate these lights. The change-over from mains power to
generator power takes only a few seconds. Accordingly, these
lights should have been restored within a few seconds. Our
enquiries in this respect brought forth the reply that it had not
7 been a case of power failure but one of a cable fault. We made
further inquiries about the time needed for locating and
7 rectifying a cable fault. The replies were most unsatisfactory.
We were left in no doubt that, the occurrence could not have
been due to a cable fault but, in all likelihood, it was just
negligence in manning and operating the generator which had
resulted in the restoration of lights in 28 minutes instead of a
few seconds. The critical effect of this outage would be evident
57 |

from the fact that the visibility was very low at that time and
the visibility minima for ILS depends upon whether the |
approach lights are available or not. Thus the non-availability
of approach lights in such a situation was a serious hazard to
| flight safety. The NAA authorities at Hyderabad should take
positive steps to prevent such occurrences.
4.9 Role of Met, Office
4.9.1 The starting point of the overall situation, which finally led to
the accident in which IC-440 was inolved, was the low visibility
at Hyderabad airport on the morning of 15th November 1993.
Inevitably, many questions were raised in our proceedings on
the weather forecast, weather reports, measurement of RVR and
the weather information communicated to the aircraft. An |
attempt is being made now to put these matters in the correct
perspective. | :
4.9.2 Hyderabad is a major, important and busy airport. Its
Meteorological office is manned round the clock and it is headed
by an Officer of Director’s rank. It has all requisite facilities for
weather forecasting. For weather observations, is is generally
well-equipped but facilities for the automatic measurement of | “
RVR have not been installed so far. Consequently, RVR readings :
are assessed visually by a Meteorological Observer. Whenever
the visibility reduces to 1500 metres, the Met Observer uses an
ATC vehicle to go to the two ends of runway. It takes about
, 5-10 minutes to observe the RVR at the two runway ends. As
each reading is taken, it is intimated to the ATC instantly
58

through the R/T set in the ATC vehicle.
4.9.3 Hyderabad airport is affected on a few occasions, by the
prevalence of. fog during winter mornings. Climatology notes
in Indian Airlines Operations Manual, Volume Il, para 1.38,
read "Visibility is generally 10 kms or more. In the winter,
however, it may be between 3-6 kms due to mist in the morning.
| Radiation fog occurs on an average on 2-4 occasions during the
winter and may reduce the visibility to nil. It, however, disperses
} in an hour or so, and the visibility improves rapidly.”
49.4 On the morning of 15th November 1993, a local weather forecast
was issued by the Hyderabad Meteorological Office at 0330
hours IST (ie. 2200 hrs UTC 19931114) and it was valid for a
period of 8 hours i.e. until 1130 hours IST. It indicated the
| visibility as 10 kms, reducing temporarily to 3000 metres in
haze between 0530 and 0930 hours IST. The actual weather
reports that morning were as follows:—
_ Time (IST) Typeof Visibility Trend
; (a) 0540 Metar 6 km Nosig
| —— (b) 0610 Speci 3000m_~=—SsNoosig
| (c) 0640 Speci 2000m Nosig
(d) .0645 Speci 1500m _—Nosig
(e) 0655. Speci 900m Nosig
| (f) 0710 speci =. 200 m Vis becoming 1500 m in mist
~ (g) =0740 Speci 500m Vis becoming 1500 m in mist .
——— (h) 0810 Speci 1200m_~_Vis becoming 1500 m in mist
(i) 0840 speci  2000m Vis becoming 3000 m in haze
59

49.5 It may be seen from the above-mentioned figures that there
was a major disparity between the forecast visibility (i.e. 10
kms. reducing temporarily to 3000 metres) and the lowest actual
visibility (i.e. 200 metres in fog). This extent of variation between
forecast weather and actual weather can make a very crucial
difference to aviation. We questioned the Director Meteorology
and we examined the various parameters on which the
forecasting of fog is based. We found that there was a weather .
system under whose influence there had been some incursion
of moisture in the region. There was a light wind in the earlier :
part of the night and calm wind later. The sky was mostly clear. oo,
The dew point was only two degrees below the prevailing
temperature. These conditions are generally conducive for the
formation of radiation fog. However, weather forecasts are based
not only on objective data but also on some degree of subjective
judgement and anticipation acquired from knowledge and
experience. Whatever may be the reason for it, there can be no |
doubt that on this occassion there was a failure to provide a
reasonably accurate weather forecast. Worse wtill, when the
visibility dropped suddenly resulting in the issue of special
weather reports at 0640/ 0645/0655 hours, there was a failure to
assess the trend of weather correctly whereby the indicator Nosig "
(i.e. No significant change) was used. Had a further drop in-
visibility been anticipated at these stages, as it should have
been done, it is quite likely that the aircraft would not have
, made the approach. .
49.6 There was one other thing which was not done correctly by the
Met Office that day and which we consider to be significant. It
60

may be seen from the data given in para 4.9.4 above that
visibility was observed to be 1500 metres at 0645 hours IST (i.e.
0115 hours UTC). Therefore, at that time, it was necessary to
check the RVR. A Met Observer was sent in the ATC vehicle to
do so. The ATC told Flight IC-440 at 0132 hours UTC that the
RVR for runway 09 was 240 metres. Later, at 0140 hours UTC,
it informed the aircraft that RVR for runway 27 was also 240
metres. The runway in use was 27 which is also the precision
approach runway. From the time when conditions were reached
) for an RVR check to be necessary, it took 17 minutes for the
aircraft to receive the irrelevant RVR of the runway not in use
_ and it took 25 minutes for it to get RVR of the correct runway.
We could find no satisfactory answer as to why the RVR had
not been checked faster and, more importantly, why the RVR
of the runway in use was not checked first. We are of the firm
view that whenever the RVR is required to be checked, it is a
matter of urgency to do so and no delay or laxity can be
acceptable. We also believe that all officers should ensure that
the work output of their offices fulfills, effectively and
completely, all the purposes for which it is intended. It is bad
enough that the Met Observer did not realise that the RVR of
. runway 27 should have been checked first. It is more
te unacceptable that officers in the Met Office at Hyderabad had
not prescribed, monitored and ensured that the RVR check is
_ always carried out in the correct sequence. Further, it is our :
considered view that at airfields where automatic measurement
of RVR is not available, there is no need to make visual RVR
checks of runway(s) which is/are not in use. These should be
61

made primarily for the beginning of the runway in use (TDZ)
and, if feasible, for the mid-runway position also. As long as
the visibility remains 1500 metres or less, and flight arrivals /
departures are expected, the meteorological observer should
Stay on near the runway beginning so that any changes in RVR
(TDZ) can be intimated by him to the ATC as soon as these
occur. Needless to say, the ATC vehicle must also remain there .
to enable the meterological observer to communicate with the
ATC. |
4.10 Operational Control |
4.10.1 The advisability of establishing and maintaining a method of
supervision of flight operations is elaborated in ICAO Annexure
6 Part I and in ICAO document 8335-AN/879/2. This is required
to be done by the Operator in a manner approved by the State _
of Registry of its aircraft. Indian Airlines have laid down in
Chapter 9 of their Operations Manual, Volume I, the definition
of Operations Control and the duties of designated Operations
Controllers, Flight Managers, Deputy Managers Flight
Operations, Assistant Managers Flight Operations and Flight
Operation Officers (Paras 9.12.0, 9.5.0, 9.5.1, 9.5.2, 9.5.3. and 953.1 .
of the said manual refer).
4.10.2 In our proceedings, we made enquiries about the role played _
by designated Operations Controllers because these officers are
charged with exercising Operations Control over aircraft, being
conversant with weather minimas, being aware of weather
conditions at departure/arrival / diversionary airfields and
diverting IA aircraft whenever weather conditions fall below |
62

the operating minima. We were informed that such controllers
are designated only at Delhi, Bombay, Madras and Calcutta
where there is heavy traffic of IA aircraft. At other airports, |
there are duty Flight Operations Officers who monitor aircraft
- movements and, if necessary, obtain further orders from their
superiors who can be contacted in their offices /homes. We made
a random check on two different days at Delhi airport to find
} out who the designated Operations Controller was and where
a he could be contacted. Our findings left no doubt in our minds
| that the system of designated Operations Controllers, as
envisioned in para 9.12.0 of Indian Airlines Operations Manual,
Volume I, is not working smoothly or effectively. There is a
need to ensure that, no matter where an Indian Airlines aircraft
may be operating, there is a suitable mechanism somewhere
which has the ability and the responsibility to monitor it and to
assist it in respect of any operational problem.
- 4.10.3 We questioned the Flight Operations Officer who was on duty
_ at Hyderabad on the morning of 15th November 1993. We
_ particularly wanted to know if he was able to, or had any
. responsibility to, influence the Commander’s decision of making
| an approach in below minima visibility conditions, or render
7 advice about the flap jamming faced by the aircraft and its
effect on the parameters of the aircraft's flight planning for its
diversion to Madras. Virtually nothing had been done by him
in these respects. We have the following comments to make:-
(a) The FOO must have at all times the latest weather reports
of airfields of interest. If he does not get such reports, he
) 63

and his superiors must do something to remedy the
situation. He told us that the arrangement between his
| - office and the Meteorological Office is that a person from
his office has to go to the Meteorological Office evey half
an hour to pick up the latest weather report. Consequently,
any special weather report issued at a non-scheduled time
does not become available until a man from his office |
goes to pick up the next scheduled weather report. For
this reason, weather reports issued at 0115 hours UTC |
and 0125 hours UTC on 15th November 1993 did not
become known to him immediately. His attention was |
drawn to the sudden drop in visibility only when he heard
Flight IC-440 going around at about 0135 hours UTC. We
are not sure if this is a true reflection of reality. However,
if it is, the FOO and his superiors in Indian Airlines must
carry full responsibility of having instituted such an
obviously defective arrangement, having lived with it day
in and day out, and having failed to remedy it.
(b) In spite of his training and experience of aircraft
performance and flight planning, the FOO failed to take rc
any action concerning the difficulties faced by the aircraft. uf
The least that he should have done was to inform his
Superiors about these and to apprise them that the
aircraft’s fuel state might be critical. Further, instead of
being a bystander, he should have taken interest in the
obtaining and provisioning of Bidar's latest visibility to
the aircraft.

4.11 Operation of Escape Chutes

4.11.1 Out of the eight escape chutes with which the aircraft is
equipped for emergency evacuation, three failed to deploy
satisfactorily. These were at door positions 2L, 3R and 4L. In
addition, the escape chute at door 1R did not deploy at all. We
could not conclusively establish the reason for this because of
tampering of evidence before the arrival of the Inspector of
Accidents at the accident site. By any reckoning, this is an

alarming rate of failure of an important safety device.
| 4.11.2 In the Engineering base of Indian Airlines in Bombay, we had
occasion to see the facilities for packing and maintenance of
escape chutes. We found that at the time of annual airworthiness
checks of all aircraft, one escape chute is operated to confirm its
. reliability. To avoid excessive infructuous work due to such
, tests, the escape chute which is closest to its overhaul time is
chosen for this purpose. We got one escape chute operated for
such a random check. The operation was only a partial success
because the pneumatic device to assist the door opening was
ineffective and, although the chute inflated alright, it stayed
doubled up until it was freed by manipulation of its velcro

. fasteners. |
4.11.3 We could not pin-point any malpractice or any deficiency in
the escape chute maintenance bay. However, we have no
hesitation in saying that the performance of escape chutes in
Flight IC-440 and in the random check of an A-300 aircraft by
us, was far from reassuring. The occassions for using escape
- chutes are extremely rare but, when these occur, their prompt
«65

and correct operation can well make all the difference between
the survival and death of the aircraft's occupants. Indian Airlines
| should thoroughly review, at least on their A-300 and Boeing
737 fleets which happen to be the oldest assets in their aircraft
inventory, the maintenance and reliability of their escape chutes,
so as to detect and remedy such deficiencies as may come to
light. This should be done with due involvement of the.
_ Manufacturers of the relevant excape chutes. |
4.12 Elap System of A-300 Aircraft |
_ 4.12.1 During our proceedings, may questions were raised about the
_ Teliability and maintainability of this system. Accusations were
made'that it does not have fail-safe design. M/s Airbus Industrie
| were blamed for the large number of occurrences of flap-
Jamming and for the lack of any advisory bulletin to caution
operators against the extent of high fuel consumption in case of
a diversion with jammed flaps. We shall now examine these
issues in detail on the basis of available material evidence and —
the arguments of various parties.
| 4.12.2 The flaps of A-300 aircraft are an extraordinarily large aerofoil
_ which experiences very considerable aerodynamic loads during .
flying. Due to engineering considerations, there is a virtually 7
_ inescapable compulsion to build these in sections. Consequently,
a mechanism has been provided to ensure the synchronised
and symmetrical movement of all the sections. To preclude any
adverse effect of flap system malfunction on the aircraft's
| controlability, the system is designed to lock-out in case of
| _ asymmetry or in case excessive torque is required for its |
| 66

movement. Such lock-outs are essentially safety features which
give the system a high degree of fail-safe capability. The basic
: design reflects the philosophy, as well as the limitations of the
technology, of early 1970s.
4.12.3 Almost right since the introduction of A-300 aircraft in
commercial service, the flap system has been affected by
} occasional instances of jamming. Consequently, M/s Lucas
Aerospace have brought out certain modifications and detailed
| trouble shooting procedures. M/s Airbus Industrie too have
| laid down in the aircraft Check List a procedure for dealing
with flap jams. This procedure is intended to release the trapped
torque by reverse movement of the flaps. It offers a fair chance
of undoing the lock-out, but no guarantee of normal operation
thereafter. We find that the instructions in the Check List seem
to have been composed without due care because, in case-of a ,
lock-out at 25 degrees position, it is not possible to carry out the
. suggested action of moving the Flap/Slat lever to “detent
~ beyond the flap position” as there is no detent beyond
f | 25 degrees. ,
4.12.4 M/s Airbus Industrie have a system of collecting from all
” operators data on the unserviceabilities and malfunctions of
various aircraft systems. This is analysed and fed back to the
operators for their information. Where considered necessary,
appropriate technical advice is also offered. In addition, any
specific technical questions from operators are answered
| salisfactorily and promptly. The accuracy of the analysed data
is dependent upon the inputs from operators. It seems that
67

some operators do not report those occurrences in which there
is no resultant disruption of their flight schedules.
Conseuquently, it is quite possible that, if the flaps get jammed
during a flight but are found to operate normally after landing, _
the aircraft may be relased for flying without any disruption of
schedules and such an occurrence may excape being reported.
We are not trying to justify such a practice, and in fact we find
it to be, very improper, but we believe that at times such things | |
do happen.
4.12.5 M/s Lucas Aerospace presented to us data on the incidence of
flap system lock-out due to various causes. This indicated that
such occurrences due to problems with the screw jacks have. !
diminished since the introduction of modified screw jacks in
mid-1980s. According to their data, the current incidence is about
| ~ 2 per 1,00,000 cycles, which they say is quite nominal. From a
study of actual cases, we found that in some cases the lock-out
got released during landing and, thereafter, neither the ,
occurrence could be recreated nor could its cause be determined. “
Presumably, the jolting of the flaps during landing can cause \
the trapped torque to be released. Such occurrences indicate
that the actual incidence of flap jams may be higher than what
the recorded figures indicate. It is well known that almost all "
approaches of conmercial aircraft are followed by landings and
it is in extremely rare cases that these are followed by a Z0-
around. If an aircraft's flaps get jammed at 25 degrees, and the
lock-out is released during the landing, the occurrence of the
flap jam would not be detected. This may happen repeatedly
| 68

without detection until a go-around takes place. Of course, this

type of undetected cases can occur only of the lock-out takes

place at 25 degrees and if it always gets released during the

landing.

4.12.6 M/s Lucas Aerospace have done well to bring out good

illustrated documents and video films to explain the causes of

) flap jams, procedures for system maintenance and the trouble

shooting sequence. However, due to basic complexity of flap

| system design, trouble shooting is far too laborious and time-

consuming. This may be seen from the fact that, in the case of

| aircraft VT-EDV, even after three months of dedicated activity
to pin-point the component which had caused the lock-out, it ,

has not been possible to reach a final conclusion so far. This is

in spite of top-class technical advice having been available

readily all the time from M/s Airbus Industrie and M/s Lucas

| Aerospace. Had the aircraft not been involved in an accident,

+ and landed safely somewhere, it is very unlikely that any

i operator could have afforded to devote so much lime or energy

7 to locate the defective item for replacement. Of course, it is

quite possible that this case just happened to be particularly

a difficult to resolve while others may be generally less elusive. It

. is also possible that, in some respects, faster progress might

have been made if an on-line aircraft had been involved.

However, there can be no doubt that trouble shooting

procedures are far too cumbersome and these should be

simplified if possible. After considering various possibilities,

we strongly suggest the incorporation of visual indicators on

all torque limiters in the flap system so that the one which

69

causes a lock-out can be detected by a mere look at the visual
indicator. Such indicators are already in use on A-310 aircraft.
4.12:7 It is quite evident that A-300 aircraft have been experiencing
flap jams for many years and, in spite of all reasonable care in
maintenance, such occurrences cannot be prevented. In view of
this, the aircraft manufacturer ought to have examined all
contingencies and consequences of flap jams and forewarned , |
all operators accordingly. One such obvious contingency is )
having to divert with jammed flaps and to fly in a configuration
in which fuel consumption is increased very substantially. Such |
a diversion could be due to weather or airfield closure
necessitated by a blocked runway or the failure of lights at
night ete. It is quite surprising that this was not thought of by
Airbus Industrie. It is even more surprising that when actual
occurrences of flap jam and diversion took place on 2nd
september 1992 and 6th June 1993, still no suitable advisory
bulletin was issued to operators. However, there was also a r
failure on the part of operators like Indian Airlines to apply 4
their own minds to anticipate various contingencies and to seek
the appropriate solutions or inputs from M/s Airbus Industrie. “4
4.12.8 Incidently, Airbus Indsutrie do have a fuel consumption |
cautionary advice for flap jam situations in the Check List of
A-320 aircraft. Apparently, their A-320 department had better
anticipation in this respect (even though the A-320 can well do
without such a caution bcause of its advanced Flight
Management System) than their A-300 department.
70

4.13 Cause of Flap Jamming |
4.13.1 We had to devote a great deal of effort towards the
determination of the cause of the flap jam in Flight IC-440. In
this task, an invaluable role was played by the Inspector of
Accidents as well as representatives of Lucas Aerospace and
Airbus Industrie. Indian Airlines rendered all possible help.
| 4.13.2 Soon after the accident, all components of the aircrafts’ flap
system were inspected and examined thoroughly. No deficiency
was found in control inputs or their transmission. There was no
| obstruction/restriction in the operation of any linkage or flap
section. Thus everything pointed towards a lock-out due to the
operation of at least one of the torque limiters. However, it
_ seemed that trapped torque in the system, if any, had been
released by the jolting of the flaps during the forced landing. A
detailed examination of all screw jacks and torque limiters was
then carried out at the engineering facilities of Indian Airlines
\ in Bombay and Thai Airways in Bangkok. This revealed low
efficiency of screw-jack at position 2LH and a reduced setting
for torque limiter activation in 4RH screw jack. The former was
; found to be on account of excessive friction in its ball-nut caused
by swollen seals due to hydraulic oil contamination. All other
| screw-jacks and torque limiters were found to either comply
with applicable parameters or to have deviations too small to
result in a lock-out. At the time of writing this report, it has
been established that the flap jam occured due to a lock-out. |
However, the specific torque limiter which caused the lock-out
has not been identified conclusively so far. Further tests are
being carried out by the Inspector of Accidents to determine
71

this. This work should continue until finality is reached.
4.13.3 The ball nut of 2LH screw jack is located close to hydraulic

circuitry. The swelling of its seals due to hydraulic oil

contamination is virtually certain to have occurred due to

spillage during component removal/installation or leakage from

an inadequately tightened connector. Indian Airlines should
evolve suitable measures to prevent any similar occurrence.
4.14 Engineering Practices in Indian Airlines
4.14.1 We had the occasion to visit the engineering facilities of Indian |
Airlines in Bombay and to see their activities relating to the
maintenance of A-300 aircraft. On the whole, we were quite
| satisfied with the engineering organisation and the maintenance

of their records. However, we have the following observations:—

(a) We found that, during the early life of A-300 aircraft, the
maintenance checks of its flap system components were a
mostly based upon “on condition” status, At that time,

Indian Airlines adopted a soft life programme for flap
system screw jacks. It entailed a bench check at 7000-7500 a:
cycles and a full overhaul at 14500-15000 cycles.
Subsequently, about six years ago, the manufacturers
advised all operators that in their opinion a TBO of 12000 ,
cycles would be most suitable. From the material presented
before us, it seems that this advice did not receive in Indian
Airlines the importance that it deserved. Consequently,
the overhauls of flap system screw jacks are still scheduled
72

at 14500-15000 cycles which is much in excess of the
| manufacturer’s recommendation. This periodicity should

be reviewed by the Airlins.
| (b) At one stage in our investigation, there was a considerable
hold-up in the testing of flap screw jack torque limiters
due to the non-availability of the special tool required for
| this purpose. It was contended by Airbus Industrie that
) Indian Airlines did not seem to possess the said tool and
its lack was indicative of the Airline having been cutting
| corners in earlier cases of trouble shooting of flap system
problems. Indian Airlines rebutted this inference and
asserted that it very much possessed the said tool. It also
explained that the tool had been sent to another base, as it
' was required there, and it was not available for some time
due to that reason. We did not find the explanation of
7 Indian Airlines to be convincing. We urge the Airline to
- review its holdings of tools and to remedy deficiencies if

any.

(c) As brought out in sub-para (a) above, Indian Airlines have
adopted a programme for carrying out bench checks of
flap system screw Jacks at 7000-7500 CSN/CSO. However,

' during our proceedings, we found that the screw Jack which

had been installed at position 4RH on aircraft VT-EDV

had undergone 10,068 cycles without having been subjected

to the bench check which was due at 7000-7500 cycles.

While this was the solitary case of its type to come to our
73

notice, such a lapse cannot be ignored because of its
implications on the reliability of the flap system. Indian
Airlines should pin-point the reason for this check not
having been carried out when it was due, and take effective
measures to prevent such slip-ups in future.
4.15 Flight Safety in Indian Airlines
4.15.1 A number of our observations in this report are generally
indidcative that, in the Operations and Engineering Departments |
of Indian Airlines, there is a need to enhance the level of flight
safety consciousness of most personnel. Reports of some earlier |
aircraft accident investigations have also contained similar
comments. We strongly advocate a concerted search for the
means to substantially upgrade the effectiveness of the Airline’s
Air Safety Department which, we feel, is presently concerned
more with routine work than with the prevention of hazards
which may lead to accidents/ incidents in future. There is also
sorne evidence of indifferent working at functional levels and
laissez-faire or laxity at supervisory levels. Since many of the
weaknesses are deep-rooted or widespread, remedial measures
should be evolved by the involvement of a few professional
people from outside the Airline with a few carefully chosen
persons from within. Apart from identifying specific thrust areas
in flying and engineering operations, this team should also
develop specific orientation programmes to bring about a high
degree of flight safety consciousness all round.
4.15.2 We understand that Indian Airlines had formed a Group in
October 1993 to evaluate the implementation and utility of CVR/
74

DFDR monitoring as a means of random detection of incorrect
procedures in flight. This Group has had a few meetings under
: the chairmanship of Capt B.S.Gopal, Director Air Safety (Retd),
Air India. It seems to us that by virtue of his vast experience
and professional distinction, he is well-suited to lead the team
of experts proposed in para 4.15.1. However, his charter would
- have to be enlarged considerably and he may have to devote a
period of about 4-6 months to this task on a virtually full-time
basis. It would be advisable to include in his team two more
| persons from outside Indian Airlines of whom one should have
a background of flying operations and the other of aeronautical
engineering. 7 ,
4.16 General
4.16.1 In the course of our investigation, we should normally have
- been able to confirm whether or not the Flight Crew of Flight
IC-440 were under thc influence of alcohol at the time of the
accident. However, .n view of Indian Airlines medical authorities
, having failed to carry out an analysis of blood samples of the
, Flight Crew immediately after the accident, as brought out in
- para 2.12.2, we are unable to do so. Under the circumstances
the concerned crew members are given full benefit of doubt
and deemed to have been free from the influence of alcohol.
Indian Airlines should examine why their stipulated procedures __
: were not carried out in this instance and to take effective steps
to prevent such situations in future.
4.16.2. Soon after our visit to the accident site, the court had the occasion
to meet the CMD of Indian Airlines. It was suggested to him
75

that, instead of awaiting any compensation claims from the
farmers whose crops were damaged as a result of the accident,
it would be advisable for Indian Airlines to discharge its social |
responsibility in this matter voluntarily and graciously. We are
- quite aware that, in the normal course, such compensation cases
_ are generally subject to gross delays due to lengthy procedures
and indifferent authorities. We are very happy to note that
| Indian Airlines responded to our suggestion admirably and
completed this task in a most laudable manner. We particularly
compliment Shri Brijesh Kumar, then CMD, for his able guidance |
in this matter and Shri D.B.S. Gujral, Deputy Manager Flight
Safety,-for his very painstaking efforts in seeing it through in
record time. As a result of the timely and vigorous action taken |
by the Airline, the affected farmers were saved from any
hardship or difficulty because they received the compensation
even before than they would have reaped the harvest which
got damaged. : :
4.16.3 We want to place on record that this accident was caused by — “
human failure and it was totally preventible. It was sheer |
- providence that it did not result in any loss of life or serious
injury to any person. There should be no complacence in | ‘
attending to the deficiencies brought out or in instituting the
remedial measures necessary. |

FINDINGS

9.1 The aircraft was airworthy and fully serviceable for the flight. Other
than the jamming of its flaps, which occured during the go-around at
Ifyderabad, there was no failure or malfunction of any systems during |
the flight. (Paras 2.6.1, 2.6.2 and 2.6.3 refer). |

5.2 The Flight Crew held valid licenses and they were fully qualified to
, undertake the flight. They had undergone the requisite pre-flight
medical examination and they had been pronounced as not being under
, the influence of alcohol. (Paras 2.5.1, 2.5.2 and 2.12.1 refer).

5.3 The Meteorological Office at Hyderabad airport failed to make a
reasonably accurate forecast of visibility on the day of the accident. It
also failed to assess the trend of visibility correctly at the time of
issuing special reports at 0640/0645/0655 hours IST. (Para 4.9.5refers)

5.4 The Commander of Flight IC-440 made an approach at Hyderabad in
visibility conditions below his weather minima. In spite of Indian
|
! Airlines’ unambiguous policy prohibiting any such approach, except
. . in an emergency, similar violations of the weather minima are
| sometimes made by other pilots also. The Operations Department of |
“ the Airline makes no worthwhile effort to detect and prevent such
occurences. (Paras 4.2.4, 4.2.5, 4.3.2 and 4.3.3 refer).
| 5.5 Flight IC-916 made a very injudicious and imprudent transmission to
encourage Flight IC-440 to go ahead and make an approach in below-
minima conditions.(Para 4.3.2 refers).
77 |

5.6 Upon going around at Hyderabad airport, the flaps of Flight IC-440 |
got jammed in the fully extended position due to a lock-out. Efforts
made by the aircraft's crew to release the lock-out were unsucessful.
(Paras 4.4.1 and 4.13.2 refer). |
_ 5,7. The ATC at Hyderabad failed to use the stipulated procedure correctly
when Flight 1C-440 was arriving in visibility conditions below its
weather minima. It also failed to obtain weather information about ;
Bidar airfield, when requested by IC-440 for visibility of Air Force :
_ Stations, and to inform the aircraft suitably. (Para 4.8.3, 4.8.4 and 4.8.5 |
refer).
9.8 When faced with a flap jam situation and very poor visibility at
Hyderabad, the Commander diverted to Madras without ensuring
that adequate fuel was available for completing that flight. In taking
| this decision, he :- |
(a) ‘Discarded the better option of holding over Hyderabad in the | :
expectation of an improvement in the visibility and, if necessary, |
~ eventually making an auto-landing there. He did so in spite of =
his having been trained in simulated auto-landings and his f
 Airline’s policy allowing him to make a below-minima landing "
in the given circumstances (Paras 4.5.1, 4.5.7 and 4.2.1 refer). 7
| - (b) Failed to seek specific information about the prevalent visibility !
at Bidar, which was easily within the range of the aircraft, and
, to consider a diversion to that place. (Paras 45.1 and 4.5.5 refer).
78

9.9 During the attempted diversion to Madras, the Commander failed to
: retract the aircraft's slats to minimise drag and, after some time, he
, reduced his speed injudiciously from about 165 knots to about 135
knots. Had these errors not been made, he could have reached Tirupati
easily. (Paras 4.6.2, 4.6.3 and 4.6.4 refer).
5.10 During the attempted diversion to Madras, the Commander and his __
" Flight Crew failed to make a timely assessment that the available fuel
, was inadequate for that flight. The Commander pressed on with his
| hopeless decision to proceed towards Madras, and missed the
" opportunity of returning to Hyderabad or diverting to Vijayawada
while it was still possible to do so. (Paras 4.6.5 and 4.6.6 refer).
_ 9.11 When the Commander realised that the fuel was utterly inadequate
for reaching Madras, he decided to head for Tirupati. [lowever, he _
could not reach even Tirupati and had to force-land the aircraft.
(Para 4.5.9 refers).
3.12 The Commander failed to caution the cabin crew and passengers, and
to take certain other essential steps, before the forced landing. (Paras
. 4.7.1 and 4.7.2 refer).
7 9.13 The Commander chose a good area for the forced landing and he
handled the aircraft skillfully during the approach and touch down.
(Para 4.7.3 refers).
5.14 The Flight Operations Officer of Indian Airlines failed to appreciate
the difficulties faced by Flight 1C-440 and to take any helpful action.
te (Para 4.10.3 refers). |
79

5.15 Operational control over the flights of Indian Airlines, as envisioned
in their Operations Manual, is not working effectively.
(Para 4.10.2 refers).
5.16 As many as four out of the eight escape chutes in flight IC-440 failed
| ‘to operate satisfactorily. (Paras 4.11.1, 4.11.2 and 4.11.3 refer).
‘35.17. In spite of proper maintenance, the Flap system of A-300 aircraftis = ,
. i prone to occasional lock-outs. The trouble shooting procedures for
| detecting and remedying the cause of a lock-out are too cumbersome |
- 4 and time-consuming. (Para 4.12.6 refers). | ,
$18 In spite of a long history of flap-jams on A-300 aircraft, both aircraft
' manufacturer and operators had failed to evaluate all possible
consequences of such occurences and to evolve the means to cope
with the same. (Para 4.12.7 refers).
5.19 The Engineering Department of Indian Airlines has not yet adopted
the periodicity of servicing of flap system screw jacks as recommended
| by the manufacturer about six years ago. Its holdings of specialist
tools needs to be reviewed. Its system of timely servicing of aircraft
components is not fool-proof. (Para 4.14.1 refers).
5.20 There is a pressing need to upgrade the effectiveness of the Air Safety
Department of Indian Airlines. (Para 4.15.1 refers).
5.21 The accident was entirely preventible. It was sheer providence that, in
spite of many mistakes made by several people, no loss of life or |
serious injury resulted from it. (Para 4.16.3 refers).

CONCLUSION
6.1 The accident was caused by :— Oo

(a) The ill-conceived decision of the aircraft's Commander to divert
to Madras, without ensuring that adequate fuel was available
_ for reaching there, when he was faced with a flap-jam and poor

visibility at Hyderabad. (Paras 4.5.3, 4.5.8 and 4.5.9 refer).
(b) The failure of the aircraft's Commander and his Flight Crew to
) - monitor fuel consumption correctly, and the failure Of the
Commander to revise his decision accordingly, until it became
impossible to reach any airfield. (Paras 45.9, 4.6.5 and 4.6.6

refer).
| (c) A forced landing due to the eventual shortage of fuel. —
(Para 4.5.9 refers).

_ RECOMMENDATIONS -
7 7.1 Atairports where the automatic measurement of RVR is not available,
_ procedures for the visual measurement of RVR should be rationalised
- and streamlined. (Para 4.9.6 refers). -
7.2 Indian Airlines should :-
(a) Take effective measures for the fool-proof adherence to the ;
applicable weather minima in each and every flight. (Para 4.2.10
: - refers). , .
(b) Caution pilots against offering injudicious advice to other
7 — aircraft. (Para 4.3.4 refers).
— (e) Enhance the utility and effectiveness of Operational Control
| over their flights to comply fully with the provisions in their
Operations Manual. (Paras 4.10.1 and 4.10.2 refer). |

aircraft escape chutes of their A-300 and Boeing-737 aircraft, :
with due involvement of the manufacturers of such chutes. (Para | |
: 4.11.3 refers). oo |
. -. (e) Seriously consider the possibility of installing visual indicators
: on all torque limiters in the flap system of A-300 aircraft to
a facilitate easier and surer trouble shooting of flap system lock- 4
outs. (Para 4.12.6 refers).
(f) Review the periodicity of servicing of flap system screw jacks _
. Of A-300 aircraft. (Para 4.14.1a refers).
(g) Review their holding and adequacy of specialist aircraft tools.
(Para 4.14.1b refers). ) : |
(h) Ensure a really fool-proof system of timely servicing of aircraft |
components. (Para 4.14.1c refers).
«82

| (i) Set up a small team of non-IA professionals and specially
selected personnel from within the Airline for thoroughly
_ reviewing and enhancing the effectiveness of their Air Safety
Department. (Para 4.15.1 and 4.15.2 refers).
 (j) ~~ Tighten the implementation of their procedures for checking
Flight Crew for presence of alcohol in their blood-stream/ breath.
(Para 4.16.1 refers). }
7.3 The National Airports Authority should :- oe
(a) Ensure strict adherence to the procedure laid down in their
DARA circular no. 6 of 1993 (Para 4.8.3 refers).
