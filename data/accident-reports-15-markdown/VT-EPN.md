Sub: Government of India's decisions on the Report
of the Court of Inquiry on the accident to
Indian Airlines Airbus A-320 aircraft on 14th
February, 1990 at Bangalore
On 14th February, 1990, an Indian Airlines Airbus
A-320 aircraft VT-EPN operating a scheduled passenger
flight from Bombay to Bangalore, crashed on its final
approach to the Bangalore Airport. 92 persons lost
their lives in the accident. A Court of Inquiry was
appointed under Shri Justice K. Shivashankar Bhat, a
sitting Judge of the Karnataka High Court, to
investigate the cause of the accident. The report of
the Court of Inquiry was received by the Government on
the the 3rd December, 1990.(cid:9) It runs into 581 pages
including its appendices.
2. The "Probable Cause of the Accident" is given
in Part IX of the report.(cid:9) There.are 85 Findings in
Part VIII of the report and 62 Recommendations in Part
X of the report.
Probable 3. The full text of Part IX of the report
entitled "probable Cause of the Accident is as follows:
Cause of
the Accident
"Fa lure of the pilots to realise the gravity of
the situation and respond immediately towards
proper action of moving the throttles, even after
the Radio altitude call-outs of "Four Hundred",
"Three Hundred" and "Two Hundred" feet, in spite
of knowing that the plane was in idle/open descent
mode.(cid:9) However, identification of thel nausft for
the engagement of idle/open descent mode on short
final approach during the crucial period of the
flight is not possible."
4. The first sentence of the quotation above
deals, with the " cause of the accident ", while the
second sentence deals with the " cause of the aircraft
going into the idle/open descent mode on short final
approach".

(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)
5.(cid:9) As regards the cause of the accident, at
several places in the main body of the report, the
Court of Inquiry has been much more specific and
clear-cut about the cause of the accident. These are
illustrated below in paras 6.1 to 6.7.
6.1(cid:9) For example, in paragraph 33 at page 324 of
the report, the Court has observed as follows:-
(33) It is clear that, the pilots failed to
convert the idle/open descent mode to speed
mode (for whatever reason) even when they saw
that the plane was in idle/open descent mode
and the plane was already in the crucial
phase of landing. After runway was in sight,
short finals_ announced and landing checks
completed, pilots diverted their attention to
find out the reason for the idle/open descent
mode, rather than reacting to the situation
by acting on the throttle levers.(cid:9) Crucial
seconds were spent in checking the FDs and
the auto-pilots.(cid:9) The entire crash is the
result of what the pilots did not do between
225 to aZil_aeconds - during_ 25 sucanda ti-s-
lo.ms than half of a minute) and not what they
6.2(cid:9) In para 37 at page 326 of the report, the
Court has observed as follows:-.
"(37) A discussion on the events during
these crucial seconds leads to one inevitable
conclusion, that the pilots in spite of
noticing the plane in idle/open descent mode
failed to react immediately at the final
phase of landing; instead,(cid:9) they tried to
find out the cause for the idle descent mode
and in this they spent some valuable
moments...."
6.3(cid:9) In para 50 at page 334 of the report, the
Judge has observed as follows:-
"(50)(cid:9) I am of the view that there was an
unnecessary diversion pf attention to check
the cause for the idle/open descent mode of
the plane and the instinctive reaction to
resort to the thrust levers did not come out
at the crucial moment."
ii

(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)
6.4(cid:9) In para 53 at pace 334 of the report,(cid:9) the
Judge has commented as follows:-
(cid:9)
"(53) There is nothing to indicate that
pilots were aware of the speed falling; these
are two experienced pilots out of whom one is
on his first route check in this aircraft.
The calmness of cockpit atmosphere indicates
that their mind was elsewhere; if not at that
point of time, pilots should have resorted to
manual operation of the throttles, instead of
searching for the cause for the idle/open
descent mode...."
6.5(cid:9) Furthermore, in finding No.15 at page 437,
the Court has remarked:-
"(15)(cid:9) At 13:02:42 ( 295 DFDR Time Frame
- i.e., about 35 seconds before the time of
first impact with the ground ), the aircraft
was at a height of 512 feet AGL. Since then
it started coming down below the profile and
aircraft speed was falling below the target
approach speed.(cid:9) There is no specific
indication that the crew monitored the speed
and height since then."
6.6(cid:9) In finding No.20 at page 438 of the report,
the Court has specifically identified what the pilots
did not do with reference to the Court's observations
in paragraph 33 at page 324 quoted above in para 9.1.
The Court has observed as follows in its finding
No.20:-
"(20Y(cid:9) This crash would not have happened:
(a) if the vertical speed of 700 feet as
asked for by Capt. Fernandez at about
DFDR 294 seconds had been selected and
aircraft had continued in speed/vertical
speed mode;
(b) if both the flight directors had been
switched off between DFDR seconds 312
to 317 seconds; or
(c) by taking over manual control of thrust
i.e. disconnecting auto thrust system
and manually pushing the thrust levers
to TOGA (take off - go around) position
111

at or before DFDR 320 seconds (9 seconds
to first impact on golf course).
6.7(cid:9)
In addition to the above three factors
mentioned by the Court in finding No.20, it is
important to add another factor which also has been
commented upon by the Court in the main body of its
report (para 2 at pages 107-108, page 310).(cid:9)
This
fourth factor is that if the go around altitude of 6000
ft. had been selected on the FCU in accordance with the
standard procedure, at the time it was asked for by the
pilot flying, the accident would not have occurred. In
such a case, the aircraft would not have gone into
idle/open descent mode because it is not possible to go
into this mode below the FCU selected
altitude.
Reason for 7.(cid:9) In regard to the reason for engagement of
engagement of idle/open descent mode on short final approach, the
idle/ope n Court has observed that "identification of the cause
decent mode for the engagement of idle/open descent mode on short
final approach during the crucial period of the flight
is not possible". HowevQr, the Court itself has drawn
attention to the most probable cause in other parts of
the report. In a nutshell, the most probable cause for
the engagement of idle/open descent mode was that
instead of selecting a vertical speed of 700 feet per
minute at the relevant time i.e. about 35 seconds
before the first impact, the pilot CM.2 had
inadvertently selected an altitude of 700 feet.(cid:9) The
vertical speed and altitude selection knobs of the
Flight Control Unit (FCU) are close to each other, and
instead of operating the vertical speed knob, the pilot
CM.2 had inadvertently operated the altitude selection
knob. The altitude of 700 feet that got selected in
this manner was lower than the aircraft altitude at
that time and therefore the aircraft had gone into
idle/open descent mode. That this is the most probable
cause for the engagement of idle/open descent mode is
recognised by the Court in para 14 at page 310 of the
feport where it has discussed this matter, and in
recommendation No.29 where the Court has specifically
suggested a design change with respect to the two
knobs.(cid:9) Paragraph 14 at page 310 and recommendation
No.29 are reproduced below in full:
Para 14. page 310
"Another probability is that CM.2 dialled the
wrong knob (thinking that he dialled the
correct knob) resulting in the selection of a
lower altitude (a possibility spoken to by
Capt. Thergaonkar). It is also probable that
he wanted to select go around altitude first
iv

and therefore selected the altitude knob,
but, while dialling it, the words just told
to him by CM.2 regarding vertical speed,
influenced his action and thus he selected
the altitude of 700 feet without even
realising that he selected the wrong
altitude. There are occasions when an action
taken with a particular object in view, gets
confused because of another object
influencing it. If CM.2 had acted at TF.294
to dial V/S knob at a time when plane was in
Alt* zone, he might have failed to follow the
requisite procedure.(cid:9) This is also quite
probable because having thought that he
selected the vertical speed of 700 feet at
the most appropriate time, he was surprised
to find the plane in idle/open descent mode a
few seconds later and therefore he expressed
to CM.1, by stating "you are descending on
idle/open descent aa, all this time".
Recommendation No.29
"Due to possibility of mistaking altitude and
vertical speed knobs one for the other, a
modification is recommended where vertical
speed knob would have a wheel to be operated
vertically up and down instead of the present
clockwise and anti-clockwise direction of
movement of the knob".
8.(cid:9) The Government has accepted the finding of
Government's
the Court as regards the probable cause of the
acceptance
accident. However, taking into account the above
of the
mentioned observations and findings of the Court, the
report
probable cause of the accident may be expressed
specifically as follows:-
"Failure of the pilots to monitor speed
during final approach, probably because they
diverted their attention to find out the
reason for the aircraft going into idle/open
descent mode rather than realising the
gravity of the situation and responding
immediately towards proper action.
This crash would not have happened if the
pilots had taken any one of the following
action:-
(a) if the vertical speed of 700 feet as
asked for by Capt. Fernandez at about
DFDR 294 seconds had been selected and

aircraft had continued in speed/vertical
speed mode;
(b) if both the flight directors had been
switched off between DFDR seconds 312
to 317 seconds;
(c) by taking over manual control of thrust
i.e. disconnecting auto thrust system
and manually pushing the thrust levers
to TOGA (take off - go around) position
at or before DFDR 320 seconds (9 seconds
to first impact on golf course).
(d) if -the go around altitude of 6000 feet
had been selected on the FCU in
accordance with the standard procedure
at the time it was asked for by Capt.
Fernandez."
9. The most probable cause for the engagement of
the idle/open descent mode during the short final
approach is that instead of selecting the vertical
speed of 700 feet per minute, the pilot (CM.2) had
inadvertently selected an altitude of 700 feet by
operating the altitude selection knob. As
this(cid:9) altitude selected(cid:9) on(cid:9) the FCU was lower
than the altitude of the aircraft at that time, the
aircraft went into the idle/open descent mode.
Aircraft and 10. The Court has ruled out any sabotage or
its systems, structural, engine or any aircraft system's failure as
including the the cause of the accident.(cid:9) All the systems of the
engines aircraft, including the engines, were found to be
performing normally.(cid:9) Specifically, the Court has
observed as follows:-
"There was no defect reported, on the
airframe, engines and their systems prior to
the ill-fated flight nor any defect,
abnormality or emergency reported during
flight by the pilots, till it crashed."
(Finding No.2, page 435)
"There was no apparent indication of any
abnormality of flying controls".
(Finding No.3, page 435)
vi

"All primary and secondary flight controls
appeared to have operated normally."
(Finding No.80, page 448)
"The engines have operated normally
throughout and have not contributed towards
the cause of this accident."
(Finding No.82, page 448)
Non-availability 11. In finding no.84 of the report, the Court has
of
ILS system observed that if ILS was available at Bangalore for
at Bangalor runway 09, most probably this accident would not have
Airport occurred. This finding of the Court is based on the
presumption that if ILS had been available, the pilots
would have chosen to make the ILS approach, and
moreover, a correct ILS procedure would also have been
followed.(cid:9) This cannot be said with certainty.(cid:9) The
pilots in this case have not chosen to follow a full
VOR/DME approach even though such facility was
available at the Bangalore airport. This accident has
occurred primarily due to'non-adherence to procedures,
particularly non-monitoring of the speed in the final
approach. Furthermore, the accident has occurred on a
clear day with excellent visibility condition and
without much traffic. Therefore, it is not possible to
accept this finding of the Court of Inquiry.
Findings of 12. In Part VIII of its report, the Court has
the Court of given 85 findings. These are reproduced in Appendix I
Inquiry, to this Memorandum together with the Government's views
on each one of them.(cid:9) The Government is unable to
accept the finding Nos.17, 19, 35, 60, 62, 65, 73, 74,
75, 76 and 84 for the reasons stated against each one
of them.
Recommendations 13,(cid:9) In Part X of its report, the Court has made
of the Court 62 recommendations. These are reproduced in Appendix
of Inquiry II to this Memorandum together with the Government's
views on each one of them. The Government is unable to
accept recommendation Nos. 1, 26, 30, 31, 33, 34, 35,
36, 44, 46, 48, 49, 52, 54, 55 and 57.

2.1. HI(1TORY OF FLIGHT:
On the 14th February, 1990 Indian Airlines
Airbus A-22O aircraft VT-EPN operated the first
flight of the day IC 662/670
on sector Bombay
Goa Bombay. These flights were uneventful.
The aircraft was then scheduled to operate flight
IC 605 from Bombay to Bangalore.
Capt.C,A.Fernande2
was to fly the aircraft for his first route check
for pilot in command endorsement under the-super-
vision of Capt.S..Gopujkar,' a check.pilot on
aircrft. Capt.SS.Gopujkar being a check
ni[ot, was
tho commander of the flight. There were
5 cabin crew members and 139 passengers including
4 infants on board the aircraft.
The aircraft took off from Bombay at 1158 hrs.
1ST after a delay of about 1 hr. from its schedule
time denarture. The aircraft was cleared to fly
on route W 17 from Bombay to Belgaum via Yarad and
then on rrfute W 56 from belgaum to Bangalore at
fliglIt level 330. The aircraft climbed to the
asslgned cruising level and reported over Belgaum
at 1°:2:3(cid:9)
V. The aircraft contacted Bangalore
approach al 12:2c; hrs. giving the estimate for entry
into Laciras FIR at 12:3 ars and arrival Bangalore
at 1^r.*

as 09. At 7.2:29 nrs. 1ST Bangalore approach
passed, the new O.NH of 1017 Millibars.
Yiritine contact with Indian Airlines flight
despatch had been established on company channel
giving the TA Bangalore as 13:04 hrs. IST. At
1.2:A4 hrs. IST, descent was requested, Bangalore
cleared the aircraft to descend to flight level
110. 7:u.rinr; the descent the pilots discussed
certain finer points of descent planning and also
planned to carry out a VOR D!' ,E approach to' R/.'
00 which included leaving 6000 ft. at 11 miles
and 4500 ft. at 7 miles for the MDA of 2230 ft.
Speed brakes were used during descent as the air-
craft was slightly high. At 12:53 hrs. 1ST Bangalore
radar identified the aircraft at a distance of 4-2
nautical miles on radial 316°. Aircraft was asked
to turn right onto heading 140' for vectors visual
approach i',/W 09. At 12:67 hrs. the heading was
changed to 1500 by radar. The crew changed the
al timeter- setting to 21.TH of 101.7 and cheei:ed. the
height at 8500 ft. At 12:58 hrs. anproach check

was 7 miles west on left base for R/W 09 with the
R/W in sight. The autopilot was disconnected.
The aircraft changed over to Bangalore tower after
being transferred by radar. Landing chocks were
carried out at about 39:02 hrs. and cabin crew were
instructed to be at stations for landing, The
aircraft went well below the normal approach pro-
file and initially touched the ground within the
boundaries of the v,arnataka Golf Club on its main
wheels(cid:9) a distance of approximately 2:',W ft.
prior to the beginning of R/W 09 and about 2)0 ft.
on the right side of -;he extended centre line of
the runway. The aircraft went up into the air
a,,ain after rolling on the ground for about, 80 ft.,
remained in the air for about 230 ft., thereafter
came down on to the ground again on the 17th green
of the golf course. This time all three gears
have dug into the ground for a considerable depth
and at one stage the right engine also, dragged on
the raised portion of the ground. Shortly there-
after the .aircraft impacted an embankment which
is anpmately 12 ft, in height. The rider-
surface of the ftselage and the centre section of
the wings appeared to have rubbed against the top
Portion of the embankment with the engines and
landing gear directly impacting the embankment.
This led to the separation of both the engines
from the wings and the undercarriage. The ail?-
crnft wings cut off some small trees on top of
the
6Iiihimkment. The aircrft In this conriiinll

flew ove2 an adjacent nullan and road just outside
the boundary embankment of the golf course acid came
to rest :Ln a grassy, marshy and rocky arse between

Tt is estimated that the aircraft fuselage Edust
have come te rest at its final position at approxi--
mateTy 1- 3:037(cid:9) hrs. IST.
An intense fire which commenced at the forward
portion of the nlselage later spread towards the
rear of the aircraft. A few passengers escaped
through the overwing emergency exits and other
openings as a result of breakages in the fuselage.
Some more passengers escaped through the rear left
door which had been opened by one of the surviving
cabin crew members.

2.2: Touch Downs:
(i) Two air-hostesses who survived the
crash have given some idea about the flight.
Mrs,Sadhana Pawar (Witness No.4).told the
Court that she
did not experience any abnomality
in the flight in question till the plane landed.
The take off was quite normal from Bombay and
cruising was also normal. She did not experience
any Peculiar high speed as the plane came down.
She was sitting at the rear side facing the tail
and therefore she could riot look through the
window after the announcement to the crew to
position themselves for landing. She has also
spoken about the 3-touch downs which will be re-
ferred later when the occasion arises. she has
also filed a copy of the report signed by her
after the crash. Earlier on the date on 14.2.1990
she was a crew member in Flight 629 to Nagpur and
Bombay in a different A-320 plane. The said flight
was commanded by Capte.Gopujkar. However, the
co-pilot WEIS one Capt.Gaul:ave After the vompintion
of the prevous flight the entire crew including
Capt.Gopu'ikar were shifted to the ill-fated Flight
6D5 in VT- EPN. The co-pilot was changed to Capt.
Fe=mandQz
(who flew the Plane as CM1 under Route
Check and Capt.Gopujkar functioned as the Pilot
Non-flying - PNF or CM2, while checking CM1).
According to licqr the 114.1-rIight.ch-.cks(cid:9)
thiS
21

plane did not disclose any defette. However,
at Bombay, after the doors were closed, another
member of the crew Mrs. Swami came to the cock-
pit and reported that water flow from boiler
No.2 in her galley was flowing non-stop. Capt.
GoDujkar instructed her to shut off the main
water vallfe situated in F.W.D. galley but$J1e
said,valve could not be closed. However,
Capt. Gopujkar tried and managed to close the
main valve with some difficulty. She also re-
ported that after the landing annauncemaa was
made, all the crew members were positioned at
their respective stations for landing, when
Captain announced "Cabin crew to your stations".
(11) Mrs.Neela Sawant Is another Lir-hostess
who was in this flight. Her report also is
annexed to her deposition. She substantially
corroborates Mrs. Sadhana Pawar's statements.
Both these two witnesses speak of only 3 touch
downs of the plane. According to Mrs. Sadhana
Pawar, the first touch down of the plane did not
give any impression of any abnormality. She
thought it was a normal landing. Thereafter she
experienced something like, being dragged but not
a feeling of jumping. The second impact was
heavy end terrible. The third landing was on a
marishe' 'lend, which we,s the final stop. She
stet-ea "I am quite certain that in all, there

The -.st resulted in the plane stopping finally
and ne first impact gave her the impression that
it 1•;as a normal landing. At the time of the
secon6 impact she vas thrown off her seat and fell
on he floor of the plane. She was on the floor
when the final impact occurred. Both these wit-
nesses speak of the fire coming out in the fron'g
portion of the plane. There was heavy smoke and
intense fire. Mrs. Sadhana Pawar had cToned the
left side exit door while Mrs.Neela Savant moved
in the cabin asking the passengers to go out, She

came out of the plane. When he was running away
from the plane after getting out of it he.
was
looking back towards the plane. According to
him fire fighting operation had not star tad at
that time. The experience of first touch do' n
was simila2 to his experiences of landings
when he weqt to Langalore.

point there was some turbulance. Before tne

on the rlinway. Thereafter there was some
movement before the second. touch downy, At
the time of the second impact he fell f)rward,
the se,t belt snapped and ho thereafter went

Toulouse, France during the fourth quarter of
1989. The manufacturer's serial numbe72 1;as
079. After acceptance by Indian Airline:3 the
aircraft,- arrived in India on 24.12.1::?8 with
an eNport certificate of airworthiness
W0.1579 of 22.12.1989 issued by the parve,
France. A certificate of airworthiness
No.194:; was issued on 26.12.1989 by the DGCA,
India. It was valid upto 21.12.1990. A eerti-
ficato or registration No.2447 was alse issued
on 26.12.1989 assigning the registration mark-
ings as VT-5I'N.
Airbus A-320 is a narrow body, siwTte
aisle, subsonic jet transport aircraft. The
fuselage is pressurised throughout except nose
cone, ,ail cone, landing gear bays and air-
conditioning compartment. A11 aircraft and
system c(ntrols for the conduct of the flight
are arMnged in such a manner that the creIT

each row having 6 seats. The seats are. 3 on
either side with a central aisle.
The flight deck of the aircraft is desig-
nated fox two pilot operation. The aircraft
uses a new technology Fly By Wire flight con-
trols operated by sidestick controls replacing
the conventional control columns. It has six
large cathode ray tube (CRT) displays replacing
the conv(,ntional instruments. This iv known
as Electronic Instrument System which is divided
into two parts namely EFTS (Falctronic Flight
Instrument system) and I3CAM (Electronic Contral-
ised Aircraft Monitor). The EIS has two CRT's
each in 1!ront of the pilots and displays mainly
flight parameters and navigation data on the
PFD (Primary(cid:9) ht Display) and the ND (Navi-
ration DLsplay). The ECAM utilises two CRT'S
one below the other on the centre instrument
panel 'mown as Engine/Warning display and System
display. The displays on these are engine
primary indications, fuel cuantity indications,
flaps and slats position indications, warning
and caution alerts, memo messages, aircraft
systems synoptic diagrans, status messages,
flight data etc.

side line markings. The
taxiways leading to the R/W have centre
line markings and taxi holding position
markings. There are three wind direction
indicators, two lighted indicators at either
end of the B/W hnd one unlighted indicator
at the signal area. There is an aerodrome
beacon flashing white and green at 12 flashes
per riltrlute.
The airfield is used by both civil an
military aircrafts and an arresto.2
harrier
is raised when required, at which time the
TORA and TODA for the R/W in use will reduce
to 10000 feet. The airfield boundary wall
is 8 feet high and runs across the approach
Path of R/W 09 at 1085 feet ahead of the B/U
threshold. The North South boundary ,.;Ail
across the approach path of B/W 09 turns at
right angles towards the east, outside the
right hand corner of the basic strip. There
is a gate made of steel grills at this corner
which opens southwards and is normally kept
locked. There is an approach road
which runs

is used in case of- emergencies. HAL has
three other fire stations at different
locations and they have two crash fire tenders
and one water tender in total. They would
also be TTessed into service in case of an
emergency. The type of fOam used in the
crash fire tenders is aqueous film forming
(flouro protein) foam.
Aerodrome fire station has an overhead
water tank of 5000 gallons capacity for fill-
ing the crash fire tenders by gravity feed.
There are three static water tanks one at
each end of the R/W and one at the middle
with 18000 gallons capacity each. Communi.
cation between the tower and the aerodrome
fire station are by an internal HAL telephone
link. There is no crash siren but the tower
indicates flying operations requiring pre-
paredness of fire crew by audio visual signals
below:
1) Flying in progress : Amber light dis-
played on both side walls of fire
station.
2) Declared emergency : Amber light and
buzzer.
3) Aircraft accident/fire : Red light
and bell.
There is no RT communication facility between
.
the tower and fire fighting vehicles. A portable
radio transmitter is available for communication
between tower and aerodrome fire station but was
49

not serviceable on the day of the acci:Tien;.
rAienever aircraft movement is ey.7,octed
or is in progress, tower indi ates the status
by switching ON the amber lig t. One cash

2.15 T,,,TRECXAGE AND _IMPACT INFORMATION
2.15.1 GROUND 1-;.A Rica:
The aircraft initially contacted the ground
51

on its main wheels in the golf CCUPSO which
lies in the approacll funnc1 of R/W 09. The
first touch down point is about 2SOG• feet
from the beginning of the R/W and slightly
to ;:le right of the extended centre
Tho aircraft after rolling about €30 feet on
the Lain wheels, went up into the air and
rememed in the air for about 234 feet. Small
trees in the way of the aircraft were crat by
lan6Wig geaTs and engines. Aircraft again
hit the ground on the slightly rising 17th
green of the golf course on practically all
thr,A gears creating deep furrows, Even the
central bottom part of the bogey beam on which
the four wheels of each main landing gems are
fltteNleft considerable indentation between
the tyre furrows. The left main gear marks
rved for a distance of 102 feat appro-
ximately. On the raised ground ahead of the
right hand main gear the right engine cowling
grazed the ground for about AO feet Possibly
biiceuse of the support afforded by the right hand
eng:7.ne nacello tho right main gear uheol
marks and the nose gear wheel marks were
shorter in length than the left main gear
marks. The nose ges. marks were for a distance
of 30 feet only. The aircraft then collided
with a 'crapezoidal embankment which form the
batndary of the golf course. This embankment

52

width of ?0 feet. There were some euca-
lyptus trees over the

The right engine nil into the nullah and the
left engine fell on to the road of tel- the
nullah, All three landing gears broke as a
result of the impact. The aircraft fuselage
with the bottom portion severely damaged and
broken landing gea27s hopped over the nullah
and it impacted the ground approxirciatc:ay 260
feet on the other side of the embanlment.
During this hop of the aircraft the varidr.s
broken and disintegrated components o: the
aircraft fell down and lay scattered all over
the ground between the road and its final
restin place. Aircraft skided on 1V;J beUy
for aboU:c; 170 feet
-before coming to a -7inal
stop with the forward end of the aircraft
about 150 feet short of the boundary(cid:9) of
the airfield.
2.15.2 WRECKAGE DETATIS
The main wrec1::vle of the
airc-2aft at the
53

final rest position was about 150 feet short
of the west side boundary wall of the Bangalore
airport. The scatter of wreckage is mainly
confined between the embankment and the final
rest position of the aircraft. Wreckage trail
extends to about 500 feet behind the main body
of the aircraft.
Engines 1 and 2 which separated from the
wing after impact with the embankment fell in
the nullah and the road respectively. Both the
nullah and the road run adjacent to the embank-
ment which forms the boundary to the Karnataka
Golf Club. The
pylon of the No.1 engine was
still attached to the engine. However the
pylon of the No.2 engine had separated from its
attachments to the engine but it continued to
cling on to it. Both the engines had disinte-
grated into three major portions namely Fan
casing, Booster stages along with portion of
fan blades and the remaining part of the engine.
Fan casings of both the engines caught fire
after breaking away from the engines as the oil
and fuel .system units are installed on the Fan
cas ings.
rain and nose landing gear structure
sheared from their attachments
and were dragged
forward along with the aircrrift. Some portion
of these vomponents fell in
the trail of the
‘.1 re‹, kagc, Bogey beaM of both the main under-
54

undercarriages along with the supporting
structure suffered extensive damage. Nose
wheel strut and its supporting structure
disintegrated. The wings remained attached
to the fuselage. Extended slats and flaps
on both the wings suffered damage due to impact
with the trees on the embankment.
Scatter behind the aircraft included the
broken surfaces of right hand elevator, portions
of right hand flap surfaces and parts of st
-ructure
of the f=ont fuselage. Some of the units of the
electronic equipment bay were also scattered.
These included a number of computer units which
suffered extensive damage.
Lower portion of front fuselage ahead of
wings was severely- damaged by impact with the
embankment. Rear fuselage behind the wings
howevF!r remained In shape till the
fire caused
severe damage. On the right hand wing there
are run'aires and openings on the front and rear
spar near the root end from where the fuel leaked

the indication of a post crash explosion inside
the tank. The left wing damage is much less
than the right wing. Main landing gear separa-
tion has caused damage to rear spar which appear-
ed to be more severe. Upper spar boom is ex-
posed and cracked. Fuel may have split due to
the damage caused. However apProximately 200
litres of• fuel was retrieved from the left wing

The.-..e was some confusion in the identifi-
cation of the body of Capt.S..Gopujkar initially.
Dr. S. B.Patil, Assistant Professor, Forensic

Analysis of autopsy reports of the 90 persons
killed are. this crash was carried out. Seat allo-
cntinn:3 of identified passengers were considered
62

and an attempt has been made to co-yela.ce the
injuries sustained. Dr.Vijai Kumar, Deputy
Director, Medical Services, Air India and
Wg.Cadr,Roopnarayan Aviation Pathologist of
Indian Air Force Posted at IAN, Bangalore
gave very valuable assistance towards his
analysis. The following are the observations:
The autopsies had been performed at Victoria
Hospital, Bowring Hospital and J.ayanagar General
Hospital at Bangalore.
Thc- formats used for the autopsies w.-re the
general autopsy formats used by hospitals in
this region. Some were in English and some were
in Kannada language. These formats were not
corresponding to the requirements of DGCA, Air
Safety Directorate Circular 3 of 1P34. Several
details which may be of use in air crash investi-
gation have therefore been left out.
Seating patterns of 65 victims bas::?d on seat
allocation are indicated separately and attached
to this report as an appendix. Body NocC, and
body No,59 were both shown against sea',; 65,
However by injury pattern it is likely that body
60.88 was seated in GC. ,Out of the 65. 4 infants
had occunied the seats along with adulL's(cid:9) The
rest of the 25 Doing unidentified could not be
placed on the seat charts.
63

Of the 90 victims cause of death for 81
have been mentioned as shock due to burns
Sustained. Only in 9 cases burns were not
mentioned in the autopsy reports. But almost
all these were stated to be allotted seats in
rows 2, 3, 5 and 6. As there was severe fire
during the initial stages in the forward portion
of the aircraft it is difficult to comprehend
that these bodies had not sustained barns.
Possibly the burns may have been post moxtem.
In 13 individuals only, there was evidence
of severe injuries with shock present, This
would indicate that 4 of these had sustained
both severe injuries with sheck as well as
burnq. The pattern of injuries is indicated
in the document appended to this report. It
is seen that 32 persons sustained injuries to
the lower limbs, 20 sustained injuries to the
head and 7 sustained thorasic injuries. It
is highly probable that at least some of these
have died of burns because of physical inability
to escape quickly.
It is evident from the seating pattern
from the identified bodies, that most of the
deaths have occurred in.passengers occupying
the first 1!) rows and rows 17 to 20, the cock-
pit crew and the two hostesses occupying the
forward seats. Passengers in the vicinity of
the r2IneJrgencv exits and those near the rear
64

door -generally have managed to escape.
It seems extremely unlikely that SI.Nos.15
and 48 wc‘re occupying the seats allotted to them
namely 26A and 28D. It is probable that they
may live shifted to soma vacant seats further
forward.
It seems possible from the injury. analysis
that the occupants of seats 8A and 8B hsve
sustained injuries due to a hard object like
a briefcase hitting the head/shoulder.
All occupants of the left side seats of
rows 5 and 6 have sustained multiple injuries
including head injury indicating the possibility
of some forces causing severe damage in this
area(cid:9) causing failure of these seats.
The autopsies on the cockpit crew did not
reveal oly evidence of acute physical in-
capacit&tion. The cause of death in both cases
were to burns sustained. Histopathological
(11J
and toxicological examination of both did, not
show any abnormality
24 bodies showed injuries to leg/ankle.
The possible cause of such injuries could be
the flailing of legs at the time of impact
hitting against the bottom bar of the seat ahead.
These injuries may have prevented some of these
passengers from exitting the aircraft in time

before tL.c fire engulfed the plane
If fire had not occurred, a large namber
of passengers would have survived.
Th.ti above observations would need action
as undeTL'
1) 1ide dissemination and strict adherence
to the contents of DGa Air Safety DireCcoratc,
Circular 3 of 1234 titled "Action xcqui-r- ri of
police -,7-2thorities in case of aircraft a;„ci-
dents" will greatly assist in the medical investi-
gation o2 aircraft accidcqits.
Autopsy formats in compliance with the above
circular should be prenared by the DGq and should
be available in adequate numbers with officials
at all airnorts in India. These shoald be pro-
vided to the police authorities immediately in
case of a fatal aircraft accident so that the
autopsy reports would be as per aviation recuire-
ments. ,:rherever possible, availability of ex-
perienc6 pathologists connected with aviation
organi!-,aions such as Indian Airforce/kilines
should L- izti3ised to a::;sist in obtaing ':iroper
au tops reports.
2) Due to a considerable number of dead
7assengers having leg injuries provislon of a
foam nad around the bottom rear bar of the seat
should be examined to reduce such injuries in
future (wilrever the pitch between the seats is
66

such that it could cause such injuries).
3) A large number of dead passengers and-
survivors had face, neck and head injuries. It
is possible that quite a few of these may have
been due to the passengers hitting their face/
head against the back of the seat in front of
them. S'Llch injuries could be Possible if the
passenger' does not tie the seat belts snugly
or the seat in front is not kept in the vertical
position prior to 1F:ndihg. It is advisable for
instructio'ns to be issues for all cabin oTew to
check and insist on the laid down procedure of
seats to be upright, seat belts snugly fastened
and.the tray tables stowed properly.

T' TS AND 1113!EA.RCH:
;salient observations from the .field investi-
gation of various systems and engines:-
2.18.1 FLIGHT
CONTROLS:
P rimary Controls:
Sidesticks of pilot and co-pilot
were damaged and burnt. Also the push
buttons of various flight control compu-
ters on the overhead panels- were burnt..
A few related computers could be re-
covered from the wreckage trail. These
computers had suffered impact *damages.
Rest of the computers are likely to
have been consumed by fire.
(a.1) Ailerons:
Control surfaces on both the. wings
were found intact along with actuators.
The surfaces could be moved freely and
there was no apparent indication of
-any
abnormality with these surfaces and
actuators.
(a. 2) DIdder:
Rudder control surface suffered no
damage during crash. The surface was
found free to move and there was no
anparent indication of any abnormality.
70

(a.3) Elevators:
Port elevator surface was intact
along with actuators. The surface was
free to move and there was no jamming.
However, the starboard elevator had
suffered impact damage and the surface
was broken. Both the actuators of
starboard side were in the extended
position for a length of about 11 to
12 ems. This was due to impact damage
suffered by starboard trimmable horizon-
tal stabilizer and elevator.
(a.4) Trimmable Horizontal Stabilizer (THS):
The position indicator of THS was
reading close to 6 nose-up. Port.
THS
surface was intact, however, starboard
surface was damaged due to impact.
TH9 motors and screw jacks wore intact.
Trim wheel on the central pedestal
was found jammed in approximately 5.2
.nose up position.
(b) Secondary Controls:
(b.1) Trailing Edge Flaps:
Surfaces of trailing
edge flaps
were damaged during the impact of the
aircraft. Examination of.
carriages
revealed that flaps were fUlly extended.
71

This was also corroborated by the
flap lever which was in configura-
tion full position.
( h2) L.E.Slats:
Slats surfaces were damaged due
to impact with trees on both the wings.
Position of tracks of various slats
indicated their full extended position.
This conforms to the flap/slat lever
position.
(b.3) gnoilers:
Spoiler surfaces were found re-
tracted on both the wings. Spoiler
lever was found in the armed position.
2.18.2 COCKPIT PANEL WITCHES AND LEVER POSITION'S:
All the cockpit panels suffered impact damages
and were exposed to intense fire. Following are
the position of some of the switches and leveTs:-
i) On glare shield panel: (For LH and RH
Navigational Display Control) VOR/ADF
switches were in VOR 1 and. VOR 2 positions,
with Range Switches in 10 miles and Mode

2.18.3 DOORS EHERGENCY EXITS AND EXCKPE/SLIDES:
1. Cabin doors and slides:
Both the forward doors on port and
starboard sides. were found closed. Both
the rear doors were open. The port side
r,-,ar door was opened from inside, but the
starboard side rear door was opened from
outside. The emergency control handle
on the port door was in armed condition.
The escape slide for the rear port side
door was lying detached from thp door in
un-inflated condition. Inflation reser-
voir attached to slide was found pressur-
ised to 2500 PSI (in green band) indi-
cating that it had not discharged and
slide had not deployed. As the rear
starboard door was opened from outside,
it had not deployed the escape slide.
2. Overwing Emergency Exits, Windows and Slides:
Only 3 overwing emergency exit windows
out of 4 could be located. Handle position
of the two windows suggest that probably
they were pulled. Other window was ex-
tensively burnt and no indications are
available regarding position of handle.
74

Escape slide of port overwing was
found lying out, but its inflation re-
servoir could not be seen as it was
lying under the fuselage. It appears
to have been burnt. It may be •possible
to confirm from the pressure reading
of inflation reservoir, which might be
under the fuselage, regarding the
deployment status- of this escape slide.-
The starboard overwing .escape slide was
found packed and partially burnt inside
the fuselage indicating that it was not
deployed.
3. Cargo Competent Doors:
Both front and rear cargo doors were
found closed. The front door was partially
burnt and damaged. Nature of burns clearly
indicated that the fire was. initially
outside the cargo hold on the Cabin side
and fire had travelled from cabin to the
cargo hold.
2.18.4 STITTCTjR4J, DISINTEG4MILAMFIRD
Major disintegration of the aircraft took
place at the time of impact with the embankment
when both the engines and landing gears were
detached. When the aircraft impacted embankment
it was in slight right bank as revealed by marks
75

on the embankment and the broken trees. The
lower side of foi(cid:9) d fuselage had suffered
severe ,crushing loads.
Immediately after separation of the o'igines
from tl - wings, there was fire on fan casing of
both the engines, as the fuel and oil system are
located over it. In the wreckage trail, burnt
pieces could be seen around .170 feet short of
final rest position of aircraft. Major fire
erunted in forward fkaselage and fire travelled
to rear side of the cabin.
The to shearing of main undercarriage from
the attachment • points on the wings, front and
rear snars ruptured more severely on starboard
side. Fuel of starboard fuel tank supported the
fire. Port wing tank fuel dripped. out from the
cracks of spar, but did not support the fire
much.

nozzles were found to be satisi'actovy.
1:eti splattering was observed on the
combustion chamber liners at 9 O'clock
nosItion, abrasion was observed on
the visible 1st stage EP turbine. vanes.
At 10 O'clock position condition of
visible fuel nozzles were found tc be

satisfactory (cid:9) Slight metal s-olatter-
ing was observed on the combustion
chamber lino:es. During visual inspec-
tion of HP compressor inlet) IGV were
found detached from 10 O'clock to 4 0'
clock position. Visible blades of 3rd
stage were found broken from the plat-
form. Third stage stator vanes were
found damaged and blades were found
dislodged at certain locations. 4th
stage blades were found damaged and
broken at tips. L.E.'s of the broken
blades appeared bent in the circum-
ferential direction opposite to the
direction of rotation. 4th stagc-, stater
vanes L.E.'s and T.E.'s were also found
damaged. 5ith stage visible blades
also exhibited damage.
Observation on variable vane (VSV)
and Active Clearance Control M75-
VSV Synchro runners were found
Positioned 10 to 15 degree from engine
centre line (similar to No.1 Engine).
Bell crank of VSV was found slightly
damaged and was in position.
ACC actuator was found displaced
and damaged and the operaticg levers
were found bent. ACC butterfly ELF
valve was found closed and LP valve
was found opcmed.
81

C. Final Observations:
General pattern of damages to the
conmressor and turbine blades and other
nar-zs of both the engine as described
above, are as a result of impact damage
and as a result of disintegration of
enines.
Torsion failure of LP shafts of
both engines and bending of LP fan
blades and compressor blades in the
direction opposite to the direction
of rotation indicate that both engines
were devoloping power during the tilue
of impact and the position of vaTlabje
stator vanes on the engines are indi-
catve of high power setting.

The computer was tested at the Yaker's
l'acility. (Sextant Avionique, Pa-',
is) and
found damaged due to impact. Reading of
the memory from all display pages was done
concerning last leg report, last leg
JAM report and previous leg l'epoyts.
Since the printouts were bad, it was
installed on AIR:INTER aircraft F-GGEB
on 18.6.90 around 22.20 hrs.GMT and
clear print-outs were taken for last
leg report dated 14.2.90 at 06:11 hrs
GMT and last leg ECAM report upto

The functional test carried out on
the two EEC at the Maker' s facility
(Hamilton Standard, Connecticut, USA)
revealed:-
i) The Units were partially damaged
due to impact,
ii) Channel B of S/N 2500-0157 passed
production acceptance test which could be
conducted on a single channel,
iii) Channel A processors of S/N 0157

now been eliminated by EEC specification
changes in future software version.
e) PMGC part No.B 398 BCM102, Serial No.702:
The comgutor was tested at the Maker's
facility (Sextant Avionique, Paris) and
found front face damaged by impact.. The
board No.A54 and A71 containing hG bite
information were removed. For extracting
bite information bite components were
:Ourther removed and mounted on now bcards.
These boards were then put in the service-
able WGC and bite memories extToc';ed.
Printout of memory extracted fog• both
command and monitor boards were taken.
The details were in a coded form. The
same were decoded 'by Airbus Industrie.

Bombay on IC-605.
f) qtrip investigation of IAB V-2500 engine
fyli V0021 (LH) and V0040 (1 H)
Both engines were strip investi-
gated at HAL, Bangalore facility by
Maker's representative along with
Indian.Airlines and DGCA representatives.
The detailed report is appended to this
report separately. The salient features
of the strip investigation were as
follows:
1. The engine break-up, due to ground
impact of both engines were similar.
But the No.2 engine H.P.C. was found
to have sustained more damage.
2. No pre-impact foreign debis was
found in the engines (birds, trees,
etc.).
3. Both engines had extensive (M.D.)
detached object damage in the air-
stream due to detached hard body
objects passing through the airstream
while the engine was rotating.
4. Both engines had a substantial quantity
of dirt ingestion. Also magnetic and
86

non-magnetic metal particles were
found in the diffuser and high
pressure turbine.
5. In the No.2 engine these pieces were
fairly large and appear to be com-
nressor blade and vane remains.
6. There was no evidence of any pre-
impact onboard fire (other than
normal combustion of fuel in the
combustion chamber).
7. Both engines did not show any evi-
dence of any pre-impact distress.
8. The break-up characteristics of
both engines indicated high rotation-
al speed under power at the time of
impact. Some Of the significant
break-up characteristics were:
i) Fan blade breakage at the blade root
and bending of the blades opposite
to the direction of rotor rotation.
ji) Riede breaxage and bending of the
blades opposite to the direction
of rotor rotation at various loca-
tions through the engine.
iii)
The L.P.C. stub shaft was twisted
and separated due to torsion:.
iv) Substantial HPC blade and vane tip
rub with HPC knife edge seal groov-
ing into the seal lands.
v)
Metalization (Metal splatter) in
87

the combustor H.P.T. and L.P.T.
blades.
(lub-Soil test at site:
The Court requested Geotechni-
cal consultant Mis.Nagadi Consultant
(P) Ltd., to carryo'it the work of
Sub-soil testing near the first and
second touch down points in order
to obtain sufficient data regarding
sub-strata conditions at site. The
report No.B-1508, dated 15.5.90
revealed that:
i) The sub-soil at landing point 1
is predominantly sandy whereas
at the location of landing No.2
the sub-soil is clayey.
ij) The relative density/stiffness
(hardness) of the sub-soil especial-
ly close to the ground level point
No.1 is greater than that at
Point No.2. This is confirmed
both in the borewell investi-
gation as well as from the results
of the dynamic cone penetration
tests.
N-Value at a depth of
0.30M at Point No.1 wer 44 against
17 at Point No.2 and a depth of
2.25M was 53 at Point No.1
against 24 at Point No.2.
88

h) Fuel sample test:
Fuel sample collected from
the accident aircraft was sub-
jected to full specification
test at approved Indian Oil
Laboratory and found to meet
vhe full specification.
i) Engine acceleration/decelaration
test as per Maintenance Manual:
To know whether the engine
acceleration/deceleration"rates
meet the reauirements stipulated
in the maintenance manual one
time fleet-wise inspection was
carried out on 26 engines fitted
to 13 A-320 aircraft. The test
was primarily based on ground
test No.13. Pre-tested re-
placement engine test (Ref.TAsK
71-00-00-700-011).
Actual engine acceleration
time intervals of the engines
tested varied from 4.56 to 8.35
seconds against maximum limit
of 8.5 seconds. Actual engine
deceleration time intervals
varied from 3.8 to 5.0 seconds
against maximum limit of 6.0
seconds.
89

All the engines have been
found to satisfy the acceleration/
deceleration requirements of
Maintenance Manual.

I. find
some observations on this question in Part IV
of the Report. Justice .?awant observed:
"although the strict rules of the
law of evidence do not apply to
the present inquiry, it is axio-
matic that the in

conducted in conformity with the
principles of natural justice. Lnci
no material should be used for

any person which he, had no 0ppon-

75 of the Aircraft Rules provides
for the appointment of the Assessors; but. their
functions are not defined* ASsessors are to be
drawn from, those who possess legal, aer,onatttical,
engineering or other(cid:9) knowledge. -1,11.1_
says tha'‘; they have to 'act' as Assessors* The
Assessors shall have the "same powers of Entry

vations shall be forwardad to the Central Govern-
ment wi th the Report.
The functions of the Assessors 117111
have to bo understood from the purpose for which
they are appointed and the qualifications required
for their appointment. It is obvious that they
have to bring in their specialised knowledge, in
certain subjects, so that they can assist the
Court in appreciating the technical questions::
The Assesc,ors are not an integral part of the
Court of Inquiry. They are given the pCrier to
investigate in view of the powers of entry and
inspection, obviously to enable theM to understand
the subject involved and to probe into the questions
that are to be an (cid:9) by the Court in which their
97

assistanc-s: will be required. The Dictionary
meaning o! the word 'assessor' is "to sit
beside, a2oist in the office of a Judge; an
official to assist a Judge is called an
assessor" - (vide Weostor's New Collegiate
Dictionay.y>. This aspect was considered by
Justice F.E. Sawant in his report made in
connection with the accident to Air India Boeing
707-437 Aircraft VT-111-J. At p.57 of the said
report, the i learned Judge pointed out:
"The purpose of the appointment
of the Assessors, further, is to

legal, aeronautical, engineering)
or from any other field helpful to

urors are drawn from laymen and
those with a special knowledge in
any field whicla has a direct or

.evolved in the trial are discour-
a;6d. The purpose of the appoint-
m•-znt of jurors is to temper the
strict letter of the lay by a more

98

to the morality and the equity of
the case. The jurors are not

There are various modes in which tho

In the course of the proceedings 7 have
enabled the Assessors to put questions ';.;0 the
witnesses and seek information whatever they
thought as necessary, having regard to the above
principles. Many of the questions were of high
technical nature. Many questions had tc.) ba
further developed for ,tlarifi cations of the answers

and therefore, I thought, instead of asking the

10. The main contest, in the Court procecdings
:.
s between the Airbus Industrie and .!.;
htc_i
the fo rrn or as the manufacturer of the aircr
,.ft;
blamed the pilots for the crash. ICPA (which is
103

a representative body of the pilots) tried to
establish that the systems in the aircraft caused
the crash by their misbehaviouf and that the
pilots must have acted properly.
Indiar Airlines has not projected any
particular case, though its learned Counsel was
highly critical of the role played by airbus
Industrie and the latter's attitude in trying to
cut short the Court proceedings, in some aspects
Indian airlines supported the case of the ICIPA.
Aero Engines leas interested only in its engine
No particular view point was projected by other
participants. There is no lis in the investigation
between the participants; therefore no participant
need to have a particular case established. But,
to enable the Court to find out the cause of the
crash, different probable causes are to b'e
projected so that no line of investigation uoulti
be left out. It is not enough for any part:tele
pants to propound a theory; the participant should
develop it and try to establish i t. Open Court
enquiry envisages evidence being gathered ani
tested in the manner of any other adversary

At 12:44 hrs. ,he aircraft requested for a de-
scent and was cleared to Flight Level 100
(10,000 ft.). From 12:50:26 hrs. the pilots
discussed between them about VOR-DAM approach
to Runway 09. At 12:53:39 the aircraft was
identified by Bangalore Radar Control (ARSR -
AIR ROUTE SURVEILLANCE RADAR with maximum range
of 170 nautical miles) at 42 nautical miles on
a VOR radial 21(cid:9) At 12:53:45 the ai-,.raft
was cleared to descend to 6000 feet on ?NH
1017 and info -nod by Bangalore Radar that the
aircraft woul be vectored for a visual annroach
o R,:nway 09. At 12:54:09 Capt.Gopujkar con-
firmed receiv ng the Radar instractions. At
12:57:16 Sang lore Radar control instruicted
IC-605 to tur:i to right on. heading 150,
15-:22 trio aircraft acknowledged and
fnill
the instruction. At 12:57:37 approach check
11.7t started and completed at 12:58:10.

2. At 12:59:24 approach target sneed 132
kts. indicated by the magenta triangle on the
speed scale was confirmed by bpth the pilots
and then flap was selected to No.1 position.
At' 12:59:48 the aircraft was cleared by Radar
Control to descend to 4600 feet when it was 10
track miles to run to touch down. At 13:00:19
flap was selected to No.2 position.and at 13:00:22
landing gears were extended. At 13:00:35 Radar
Control, informed the aircraft position at 7 miles
west on left base leg for Runway 09 and asked
IC-605 to report Runway in sight. At 13:00:38
the flap was selected to No.3 position, At
19:00:42 the aircraft reported Runway in sight.
At the same time the Auto Pilots were disconnected
as indicated by cricket sound 3 times in r'1/R.
At 13:00:48 Radar Control asked IC-605 to resume
its own navigation and switch over to control
Tower frequency(cid:9) time flan(cid:9)
was selected to No.4 position. At 13:00:51
the aircraft changed over to Bangalore Tower
for further instruction. At 13:01:20 C1.11 asked
if landing checks were completed but CN2 wanted
to complete the check at 1400 feet A.G.L.
(above ground level). At 13:01:36 (DFDR second/
228) CM2 announced alt. star and repeated that
announcement at 13:01:40 (DFDR second 232).
This speed alt. star indicated altitude acrnii-
sition mode for 460n feet which was selected
earlier. This timer C1,12 wanted to set go around
107

altitude but CM2 suggested vertical speed
selection which CM1 finally agreed to.
Had go around altitude of 6000 feet been
selected the aircraft would have gone into
open climb which was not desired at this
juncture. Scrutiny of the DFDR data revealed
that at DFDR second 225 the aircraft was in
altitude capture mode when it was descending
to 4600 feet and when alt.star phase was
active the aircraft went into idle open descend
at DFDR second 235 obviously due to a selection
of lower altitude than 4600 feet. However,
at DFDR second 247 the idle open descend mode
was changed to speed mode again by selection
of 1000 feet/min.rate df descent on FM by 042.
3. At DFDR second 260 CM2 asked tower for
landing clearance when CM1 asked to set go around
altitude again. At DFDR—s-ezond 265, CM2 reported
to be at "short final" which was acknowledged
by the tower and landing clearance was given.
CM2 seems to have not acted as renuested by
CM1 to set go around altitude. At 13:02:23
(DFDR second 275) landing checks were completed.
Capt.Thergaonkar in his deposition sated that
at this time (T.F.260) go around should have
been set.
It was contended that this eras a d,17iation
from "Normal Procdure" under
riFi nal AFT
108

check list detailed in FCOM Vol.3 Chapter
3.03.15 page 2 which states that
"(PNF) GO AROUND Altitude (cid:9) set.
Set go around altitude on MI"(cid:9)
This is required to be done before completion
of landing checklist. However this deviation
was not a major error and did not contribute
in any way to the accident.
From co-relation of CVR & DFDR data it is
evident that at DFDR second 225 altitude accui-
sition mode for 4600 feet was activated. The
chart showing the approach path indicated that
it was about 600 feet higher than the normal
path when altitude acquisition mode was acti-
vated. Normally 700 ft./min.rate of descent
is required to maintain the final approach
path but in this case the aircraft was higher
and CM1 asked for 1000 ft./min.rate of descent.
Accordingly, vertical speed mode was selected
with 1000 ft./min. rate. Actual rate of descent
was, however, around 2000 ft./min. initially
and then reducing gradually to about 1200 ft./
min. Due to higher rate of descent the aircraft
speed increased to about 148 kt. whereas approach
target speed of 132 kt. was required to be main-
tained. However, when landing clearance was
given, the aircraft was almost in the proper
approach path but its speed was about 9 knots
109

higher than the required speed.
4. Therefore, it can be said that the
aircraft, more or less, descended properly and
its initial approach profile, even though
slightly higher, can be said to be normal.
The aircraft was•. fairly in approach profile
when it was 1000 feet AGL and obtained landing
clearance. .:The aircraft was also in proper
landing configuration. There was no contro-
versy on this question.
5. At this stage, two conflicting views
have been expressed. According to one view,
the pilots though initially discussed about
VOR-DME approach, later accepted the Radar's
offer to be vectored for visual approach to
Runway 09, and from 42 nautical miles to 7
nautical miles, Plane was guided by Radar and
thereafter pilots adopted visual approach.
This view is accepted by Sri Goswami, one of
the Assessors and is given at Section 'A'.
6. The other view is that the approach
adopted by the pilots was perfectly normal and
even if it was visual approach other aids avail-
able can be availed of by the pilots. This
view found favour with Ws.Capt.C.R.S.Rao and
Capt.Gopall is elaborated in Section 'B'l below.
110

A. ONE VIEW:
A(1): Capt.Gordon Corps of Airbus Industrie
in reply to questions by ICPA Counsel,
explained in his deposition, "It- is
our consid.eted opinion that having read
the CVR transcript and heard the CVR
many times in conjunction -with the pub-
liihed procedure for a non-precision
approach that, whilst as in normal- practice
the appropriate radio aids wei.e tuned the
actual flight path of the aeroplane was
such that a non-precision approach as
laid in the Jeppessen Manual was not
actually being followed".
Perusal of the CVR transcript reveals that
A(2):
from 12:50:26 hrs.the pilots discussed
between themselves about VOR-DME approach
to Runway 09. But at 12:53:45 hrs.they
were informed by Radar Control that the
aircraft would be vectored for visual
approach to RunWay 09. At 12:54:09 hrs.
Capt.Gopujkar confirmed receiving the
Radar Control instruction and accepted
visual approach to Runway 09. In this
connection it is stated in para 10.1.4
page 2-11 of ICAO Dc.4444/RAC 501/12
"Rules of the Air and Air Traffic Servies"
(12th edition, 1085) "If an air Traffic
clearance is not suitable to the pilot
111

in command of nn aircraft he may reeniest
and if practicable, obtain an amended
clearance". Having accepted Radar Con
trol instruction for a visual approach
at 12:54:09 hrs. Capt.Gopujkar never
asked for an amended clearance for VOR-
DME approach instead of being vectored
by Radar to follow visual approach as
offered by Radar Control. From the CVR
it is apparent that after being spotted
by Radar at 42 nautical miles at 12:53:39
hrs. the aircraft was under constant
surveillance of Radar Control which was
giving necessary guidance and instruction
to the aircraft from time to time upto
7 miles west on the left base leg for
Runway 09.
A(3)1 Further, it has been observed in the
Jeppessen Manual that the chart dated
25.8.89 dealing with VOR-DME approach
to .Bangalore Runway 09 requires a mini-
mum sector altitude of 6000 feet. Initial
approach altitude is 6000 feet, initial
approach fix is 13 DME and inbound of
the approach is 089°. In other words
from radial 316° the aircraft has to
come upto 13 DME arc. At 13 DME the
aircraft has to turn right to maintain
112

11 DME arc and 6000 feet to descend
to 4500 feet. On crossing lead radial
of 279° the aircraft has to turn left
to intercept inbound 089° radial.
4500 feet altitude should be left at
final approach fix of 7 DME and descend
to MtA of 3270 feet. Missed approach
will be at 2 DME as per procedure.
If, only VOR is available the aircraft
has to come over VOR at 6000 feet .and
then,follow 269° radial outbound to
4500 feet and turn right at 7 DME to
meet radial 089° inbound and then follow
the procedure as stated above.
A14): In this case the aircraft was vectored
by Radar Control from 42 nautical miles
to 7 miles and then the runway was in
sight the aircraft was asked to resume
its—own—navigation i.e., visual approach
as already instructed byRadar. 'In this
connection it is to be noted that as per
Schedule IV of Aircraft Rules 1937
Section 3, para 3.5.1.1, "An aircraft
shall be operated in compliance with
air traffic control clearance received".
•
flOperation Manual" Compiled by Indian
Airlines under CAR Series '0' Part I
Issue I dated 31.12.1976 para 4 is a
mandatory document to be carried on
113

board for the 'guidance of the flight
crew. It also stipulates in Chapter-I
page 1.20 para(cid:9) item 2 "ensure
that the flight is carried out in
accordance with the ATC clearance".
A(5): Thus, from 42 nautical miles to 7 miles
the aircraft was uncler. Radar Control
and since then on visual approach.
Therefore, the aircraft did not follow
VOR-DME approach at all, although VOR
radials were used during flight which
is normally done.
A(6): Para 3.7. 3.3.1 in page 3.19 of Chapter
III of the same Manual states in respect
of stabilised approach:
"The approach is said to be stabi-
lised when the aircraft is flown
at constant rate of desnent, at
---torrect speed and altitude in
approach configuration and only
minor power and heading adjustments/
are needed. All approaches, irres-
pective of the weather conditions
should be stabilised well before
crossing the Runway threshold".
A(7): Normally an approach should be stabilised
in landing configuration by a safe alti-
tude above touch down. At this safe
114

altitude if the aircraft is not on the
correct glide path or approach profile
in landing configuration with speed
stabilised, then the approach must be
aborted. The idea behind such a re-
quirement is self evident. The inertia
and forces acting on large commercial
jet aircraft are such that alterations
to approach profile and speed cannot
be made at a late stage in the approach.
A(8): It is evident in the case of VT-EPN the
aircraft did not stabilise at any stage
during approath.
115

B: ANOTHER VIEW:
3(1): A jet transport aircraft is an aircraft
which can. become extremely critical
within a few seconds during the vital
phases of flight of take off and landing
in case they are not handled correctly.
This is the to various reasons.
(a)T he heavy weight of the aircraft.
(b)C haracteristics of a jet engine which
takes quite a few seconds before the
engine develops thrust if the power
was at idle prior to acceleration.
(c)T he high power to weight ratio due
to present day modern technology, etc.
For example, under any particular condi-
tions of flight, in case the engine power
is at idle, if thrust lever is moved for-
ward for engine acceleration at a parti-
cular speed, the aircraft would lose its
speed by approximately 6 to 10 kts depend-
ing on the type of ainTaft and the type
of engines fitted provided the same flight
profile is maintained. Similarly if an
aircraft is descending with engines at
idle maintaining a constant speed and if
thrust levers are moved forward for
accelerating the engines at a particular
116

height, there would be a certain loss
of height before the aircraft would
level out and start climbing if the
same speed is maintained.
B(2): During final approach, aircraft would
be having the undercarriage down and wing
flaps and slats extended. The under-
carriage 'contributes to a lot of addi-
tional drag. The wing flaps and slats
when extended provide a larger wing sur-
face area and smoothen out the air flow
over the wings at higher angles of attack.
More lift is generated whereby the atr-
craft at the same weight can be flown
at slower speeds when compared to flying
without slats and flaps extended. These
devices also-help in improving the visi-
bility available to the pilot because
of the change of the pitch altitude avail-
able to the aircraft. The plane can be
landed safely at a lower speed. From the
A-320 quick reference handbook page 22,
we observe that the approach speed, when
the slats are lesser than one and flaps
are lesser than one would be Vref+50 but
for the aircraft at the same weight with
flaps and slats at full position, the
approach speed would be Vref. 'Extended
flaps and /slats increase the drag con-
siderably and as a result reducing the
117

margin of power available in case of
encountering a difficult situation.
On final approach, when aircraft is
3( 3):
descending even on the normal approach
profile, for example, with a speed of
about 20 kts above Vapp and the thrust
is at idle for purposes of reducing
speed, it would be necessary for the
pilot to anticipate and increase thrust
about 6 to 10 kts before target speed
if he wishes to prevent the speed drop
below Vapp, all the while continuing
to maintain the normal approach profile.
B(4): If a pilot is high on approach and is
at the correct approach speed, if he
wishes to regain the normal approach
path by increasing the rate of descent
holding the thrust at idle, he should
anticipate in advance of intercepting
the desired profile by increasing thrust
to prevent going below the approach pro-
file, and losing speed below Vapp.
B(5): The range of height loss and the range
of speed loss would vary with the weight
of the aircraft, the engine characteristics
and the flight environment prevailing.
118

B(6): Pilots fly into various airfields. The
R/W's may be level,. may have an upslope
or may have a downs-lope. Normally the
desired approach profile would be close
to 3° to the horizontal. On the same
approach slope, if the R/W has a down-
slope in the approach direction, the
pilot would feel that he is on a lower
approach slope. If there is a gradual
Sloping ground below towards the R/;•l
it can cause severe problems to the
aircraft, if for any reason .a slightly
lower approach profile is followed.
An aircraft has crashed on approach to
a south easterly R/W in Cairo due to
such downslope of R/W and high gradually
sloping ground belovi. If there is an
upslope on the R/W in the direction of
approach and landing like it was at
Bangalore R/W 09, the pilot on approach
would feel that he is high even if he
is on the correct approach profile. This
is due to the approach perspective he is
used to, at a majority of airfields
which are level. There could be a
tendehcy for a pilot to come a little
lower.
B(7): Considering all these above factors,
pilot instructors have always trained
119

jet transport pilots to use all aids
available at the time of an approach to
ensure safe approach and landing even
whilst carrying out a visual approach.
Normally there are various radio aids
like NDB (Non Directional Beacon),
Marker Beacons, VOR (VHF Omni Range),
DME (Distance Measuring Equipment),
ILS (Instrument Landing System), etc.,
To assist during the visual segment of
any approach, we have VASI, PAPI, etc.,
which gives, by means of certain type
of lighting on either side of the R/W
or on one side of the R/W, a safe
approach angle to the touchdown zone.
Though at night VASI would be visible
for a longer distance in good weather,
during day light, and sunshine the dis-
tance to differentiate the colours for
interpreting a proper approach path would
be very short. From personal experience
of the two assessors, Capt.C.R.S.Rao and
Capt.B.S.Gopal who have been on board
the aircraft during approach to Bangalore
on both, R/W 09 and 27 at times close
to mid afternoon in bright sunlight,
it was observed that VASI could be used
meaningfully for an approach from
300/400 feat.
120

If an NDB is located at 1.7. nautical
3(8):
miles like "BB" at Bombay in line with
R/W 14 at Bombay (which has a downslope)
and a pilot even if on visual approach,
crosses this NDB at 500 feet above
threshold elevation, he would achieve
a safe approach and landing by maintain-
ing a correct descent rate and speed to
the touchdown zone. Similarly if knowing
the location of the DME transmitter of
the airfield that is being utilised, if
correct heights are maintained at anpro-
nriate distances from the R/W threshold,
the pilot would have at all times an
idea of how the aircraft is placed,
whether high or low ammpared to the
normal desired profile. For example,
if a pilot is at 900 feet at 3 nautical
miles from touchdown zone, he is on a
good approach path. If higher or lower,
corrections may be needed. Normally a
safe approach always results in a safe
landing.
B(9): All approach procedures are designed to
cater for bad weather and low clouds
over the airfield or low visibility.
They also cater to different tyres of
aircraft having different types of
121

navigation equipment. It also caters
to separation requirements between
aircrafts, delay to aircraft where
holding is required for any reason,
failure of some navigational aids or
ATC facilities available at the air-
port and communication failure between
aircraft ,and ATC. Considering the VOR
DME approaCh for R/W 09 at Bangalore,
if ATC radar is not operative, an
aircraft could join at any Initial
Approach Fix (IAF) and come, onto final
using the VOR and DME. If DME is also
unserviceable and only VOR is avail-
able and it is not possible for the
aircraft to absolutely locate its
pOsition with respect to the airfield
it would become necessary for the
aircraft to come overhead the VOR and carry
out the prescribed procedure of the WIR
approach for P/W 09 by using elapsed time
during the outbound leg. This is the
reason why the same chart indicates VOR
approach for R/W 09 also.
B(10): Normally all schedule operators file
an IFR (Instrument Flight Rules) flight
plan. The flight is conducted according
to instrument flight rules. ATC w,)uld
be responsible for ATC separation till
the time the aircraft lands or cancels
122

IFR flight plan at an earlier stage.
ATC radar knows the location of the
aircraft with respect to the airfield
at all times once the aircraft has been
identified on the radar screen. Thus
they would be able to guide any air-
craft, both in good weather and in bad
weather - V) a position from which the
pilot can take over for continuing the
approach, either by use of the radio
aids serving that VW or if conaitions
permit, .a visual approach. Once a
pilot sights the R/W and is willing to
take over for a visual approach, the
responsibility of the ATC radar to
position the aircraft for a safe
continuation of approach, ceases. If
,the radar is handling other aircraft;
such a change over would assist the
radar. controller in reducing his work-
load.
B(11): Capt.Thergaonkar has deposed on page 5
that it is normal to carry out an in-
strument approach even if the weather
conditions are good, when the pilot is
under chock. For other pilots under
good weather conditions visual anproach
is permitted. For the purpose of route
check, the tests are carried out by
123

applying both kind of approaches.
B(12): One of the items to be filled by a
check pilot during route checks in
the DGCA proforma is "Type of. Approach".
B(13): All available radio navigational aids
as appropriate should be used even
during aivisual approach to establish
a safe approach path. Even if an air-
craft is cleared for a visual approach
and an ILS is available for that R/W,
it would be prudent on the part of the
pilot to use that aid which would give
the pilot a far superior flight guidance
compared to his own judgment based on
the R/W perspective. If anyone feels
that it is wrong on the part of the
pilots of IC-605 if they had used the
VOR and DME and NUB that were available,
then their opinion would not be in the
interests of flight safety. In Bangalore
even for a visual approach, DME would
be an excellent aid to check heights at
various distances for evaluating the
correctness of the approach profile and
to receive the DME, VOR should be selected.
The final approach segment of the VOR DME
approach in no may conflicts with the
visual approach or any other aircraft in
a visual circuit.
124

B(14): An ATC clearance is only a clearance.
It cannot be mandatory. For example,
if an aircraft is cleared to land, it
does not mean that an aircraft should
land. A pilot will carry out a go around
if for any reason he feels that the
approach becomes unsafe to continue,
or if when he is on short final a vehi-
cle crosses the R/W, etc. The pilot
cannot be faulted for not landing during
that approach. It is necessary to look
at the spirit behind any of these clear-
ances.
B(15): Capt.Fernandez was carrying out his first
route check for PIC endorsement. The
DGCA requires 10 satisfactory route checks
of which at least 5 shall be by night
for granting this endorsement. Generally
during winter the weather all over India
would be good. It is quite possible
that on the sectors that,A-320 was
operating at the time of the crash,
for the Bombay based crew, the weather
could have been visual for all these 10
route checks. If a pilot is not checked
for various types of approaches even
under visual conditions and all these 10
route checks carry ot,t visual approaches
125

and landings, it would not be in the
interests of flight safety to grant PIC
endorsement and release him to fly as
Pilot in Command both from the point of
view of. regulatory authority and the air-
line. It is necessary to check the
competency of the pilot carrying out
both visual approaches and instrument
approaches prior to certifying him as
fit for PIC endorsement. Policy of
Indian Airlines as deposed by Capt.
Thergaonkar would be very correct in the
interests of safety of operation.
B(16): There were arguments regarding the re-
quirements of a visual approach. The
flight manual 2.01.00 page 1 permits
VFR operations. Flight manual 4.03.00
page 7 permits use of auto thrust with
or without AP/FD. During approach the
use of FD is approved with use of NAV
mode for VOR/DME, VCR, ADF approaches.
The above statement is made based on the
revision dated 16.3.1989 valid for
A-320-23I aircraft which clarifies that
use of both auto pilot and FD engaged
is approved.
B(17): This .revision would appear to mean
that
in the three earlier lines under
APPROACH
the use of auto pilot or FD is apnroved.
Nowhere in the flight manual we can find

a prohibition of the use of FP during
a visual approach. Use of available
radio navigation aids aurinp a visual
approach is also not prohibited by the
flight manual.
3(18): Airbus Industrie referred to FCOM 3.04.11
page 63B, revision 09, seq.001 under the
heading 'Visual Approach with FPV'. They
provided a copy of this page to the Court.
However they did not provide the copy of
the page 63A in respect of the same pro-
cedure. There was some confusion in the
numbering of the pages of FCOM covering
the .same procedures between the copies
with Airbus Industrie representatives and
the copies made available to the court
by Indian Airlines immediately after the
accident. We would be quoting references
from the manuals made available to the
Court, which were the status of the Indian
Airlines manuals on the date of the acci-
dent. On page 63A it is clearly indicated
as below:
"The described visual approach is
made with FPV only (for usually, there
is no FIX to initialize target s]ope)
(Both FD OFF)".
On page 63B for the visual approach
with FPV, both FD1 and FD2 are required
to be put off at the start of the approach.
127

This is not relevant to the approach
of the VT-EPN at Bangalore.
B(19): FCOM 3.04.19 page 5, revision 03,
seq.001, under heading 'Flight Patterns
Visual Approach (one or two engines)
does not state at any point, the re-
quirement of flight directors to be
put off. Similarly FCOM 3.04.19 page
7, revision 03, seq.0011 for standard
circuit pattern does not indicate the
requirement of putting the FDs off at
Any time. FCOM 3.04.19 page 9, revision
03, seq.001, for low visibility circling
approach does not indicate any requirement
for the FDs to be put off. Any of these
approaches would have the visual segment
of final approach which VT-EPN had.
Except for a visual approach with FPV
as mentioned earlier, nowhere in the
FCOM volume 3 under procedures and
techniques have Airbus Industrie mentioned
the prohibition of the use of FDs during
a visual approach.
B(20): When we look at the full flight simulator
profiles of the Aeroformation course
(PF CM1 which we expect Capt.Gopujkar
and Capt.Fernandez would have carried
out), we find the following:
128

In FFS 1 there is one visual
approach ILS supported.
In FFS 2 there is one visual approach
ILS supported.
In FFS 3 there is one single engine
visual approach raw data (which we again
think is raw data ILS as raw data is
generally used for ILS approach without
and
FDa) and there is one visual approach
landing on 15R.
In FPS 4 we have one no slats visual
approach 15R with FDs:
In FPS 5 and FFS 6 there are no
approaches.
FFS 7 is a check session wherein there
is no visual approach.
From all the above we see that there
is only one visual approach without the
assistance of any other approach aids
indicated in these profiles, (i.e.), in
FFS3.
Aeroformation have also carried out
in FFS 4, a visual approach with FD (item
7) .
The pilot has not been checked out
for visual approach capability in his
simulator check ride. also F'S 4 shows
that use of FD is permitted during a
visual approach.
129

The above profiles also show
that Aerofbrmation have trained pilots
to use available aids such as ILS during
visual approaches.
B(21): Capt.K.Shreshta on page 3 of his deposi-
tion has stated in connection. with a VOR
approach, "Only in case we are visual
we can switch off the FD bar if we so
desire". He is a very young, pilot with
limited experience and this statement
indicates that FD bars can be used even
during the visual segment of a VOR approach
after the MDA. This would only be based
on the training he has received.
B(22): The contention of the Airbus Industrie
representatives who deposed before the
court that FD bars should be put off for
a visual approach cannot be accepted.
Secondly, VOR DME usage by the pilots
cannot be faulted. All this unnecessary
controvdrsy would not have risen if the
pilot had just transmitted to the ATC
that they would continue on a VOR DY7
approach after being positioned nn final.
No air traffic control unit in the world
would say NO to such a statement.
B(23): The clarifying submissions on behalf of
Airbus IniJustrie sent to the court vide
130

AI/DA L,No.115.0740 dated 5.10.1990,
has enclosed in appendix C of one of
the booklets, a JEV.PESSEN approach plate
for (cid:9) VOR DME R/W 09 & VOR R/W
OP approach. This approach plate is
dated 25.8.1989. On page 5 of that
booklet under section 5 they have not
made.any mention of the MDA. It is
observed that the MDA indicated in this
chart is 3270 feet. Referring to CVR
transcript page 8 in Exhibit 1, at crash
seconds 720, CM1 has indicated MDA as
3280. Indian Airlines Aerodrome operat-
ing minima chart dated 22.12.1989 has
given the MDA for VOR TIME R/W 09 as
3280 feet. This has been used by- the
pilots in their discussion. On CVR
transcript page.13 at crash seconds 162
Bangalore radar has indicated position
of 7 miles west on left base B/W 09 for
IC-G05. The pink approach path indicated
by Airbus Industrie on this JEFPFSSEN
approach plate has brought the aircraft
to a position which is 4 nautical miles
on the DME. VOR and the colocated DI'1E
are close to the beginning of R/W
Length of the B/W is 10,850 feet. At
4 DME the aircraft is just 2.4 nautical
miles from the R/W.
131

3(24): The aircraft commenced a slow left turn
from heading 150° from about 188 seconds
as that was the time a left bank has
been introduced. Aircraft was also
having a tailwind component of nearly
14 kts. Aircraft would'have had a wide
turning radius with a slow increase in
bank angle. The maximum bank angle nut
ih was close to 25° when the aircraft
was just angle 15° from the R/W heading,
most probably because the pilot felt
that he may over shoot the centre line.
If an immediate 30° bank angle had been
put in at 188 for turning on to final,
the aircraft would have been on final
very much earlier. R/W was visible.
So a pilot using both the VOR DME and
hi vision of the R/W has carried out
a shallow turn which is quite natural.
The slow correction can easily be seen
from the way the headings have changed
from D7DR time frame 225 from fig.1 of
the rr7ised data. Considering at + 15°
to RA heading whilst turning visually
on to final as being close to the final
approach path, this aircraft would have
been on final well before what has been
indicated by Airbus Industrie. We should
also remember that this aircraft crashed
wel" ,efore the 3/W and we must allow
for - 11te location of the VOR.

The approach path indicated by Air-
bus Industrie on this JEPPESEN chart
is inaccurate.
13(25): The pilots of VT-EPN were meticulous as
they used the latest MDA of the Aerodrome
operating minima chart and not the MDA
given on the approach plate which was of
an earlier date.
B(26): FCOM 3.04.11 page 62, revision 12 and
page 63, revision 9 are for a non-
precision approach. This does not call
for FDs to be switched off. The bottom
Portion of page 62 and 63 would refer
to the uae of FD as the FD bars have
been shown in the pictorial representa-
tion. In this approach which is the
usual procedure that should be followed,
Airbus Industrie have not indicated any
point at which the go around altitude
should be set. They have not prohibited
selection of MDA on the DOLT altitude
selector. This EMGS procedure is des-
cribed from the start of the approach.
The only requirements indicated are:
Reach final approach fix with configura-
tion full and Vapp.
Passing fix select vertical speed = -1000
feet per minute.
133

Keep vertical speed down to MDA.
At MDA, if external visual' conditions
sufficient.... continue visual approach.
Though on page 3.03.15, page 2, revision
12, during final approach they have'indi-
cated that go around altitude is to be
set. If the non-precision approach pro-
cedure dpscribed earlier in this paragraph
is followed, there is no requirement to
set go around altitude.
B(27): At DFDR seconds 234 auto pilot altitude
capture has gone off and the altitude
of the aircraft was about 4600 feet.
This was approximately 100 seconds from
the touchdown. zone. At that time the
aircraft would have had approximately
100 to 105 seconds from the touchdown
zone and the aircraft would have been
approximately 4 to 4.1 nautical miles
from the touchdown zone. For a normal
approach aircraft should have beel,
around 1200 to 1:00 feet above the
touchdown zone (TDZ) elevation. The
aircraft was slightly high at this point
of time but it was in a position to
carry out a safe approach for landing.
This was evidenced by the aircraft
en
11
being at the correct heightLat 500 feet
above TDZ elevation.
1J4

B(28): Selection of 1000 ft/minute rate of
descent upto the MDA and seleCtion of
MDA' On the, Fal have shown that these
pilots were using- the VOR DME approach
procedure when the aircraft was on
final.
B(29): Capt.G.Corps during examination on
behalf of the court was asked a few
questions about the Bangalore approach
charts and the flight patterns in FCOM
section 3.04.19. He confirmed that
there was no snecific chart associated
with a visual approach at Bangalore in
the charts that were made available to the
court by Indian Airlines which are used
by their pilots. He also stated this in
his answer, "But I believe that it is
standard practice to assume the go
around altitude published ,on the chart
for the appropriate R/W in case the go
around has to be made for whatever reasons".
It is only a belief and not a statement
of fact. When visual approaches are
carried out, an aircraft on a go around
will continue on a visual circuit.
Even the flight patterns in 3.04.19 for
standard circuit visual approach, etc.,
show a height of 1500 feet above Aerodrome
135

Elevation as the circuit height. If
that is considered the circuit height
at Bangalore would work out to 4414 feet
to 4500 feet .rounded off to the nearest gh e
hundred. Even Airbus Industrie's own
theory of 6000 feet go around altitude
to be set does not conform to a visual
approach. It would only refer to a
missed approach altitude for either
the NDB approach or VOR approach for
R/W 09.
B(30):F urther, in his deposition, Capt.G.Corps
has confirmed that there is no mention
of FDs to be put off in the visual
patterns on page 5, 6 and 7 in FCOM
section 3-04-19. A-320 FCOM bulletin
No.2 of April 1989, page 3, permits use
of FD during visual approach but auto
thrust should be in speed mode. Thus
this also shows that there is no Prohi-
bition by Airbus Industrie to keep the
FDs(cid:9) du-ring a visual approach. In
that respect the pilots have not erred
in keeping the FL)s 'ON' even if it is
considered that it was a visual approach.
B(31):A -320 FCOM bulletin No.9 dated April
1900 which was later revised by FCOM
bulletin No.09/2 June 1990 on page 3
under recommendations item 1 states that
136

"Selected altitude in the FCU window
should never be set below 1500 feet
when in VMC".
It must be observed that Airbus Indus-
trie have used the words "SELECTED
ALTITUDE IN ,THE FCU WINDOW. " Altitude
is always used to r efer to height
above mean sea level. The Aerodrome
Elevation of Bangalore at the ,ARP is
2914 feet, Altitude of 1500 feet if
selected on the FCU window would be well
below ground level at Bangalore. Airbus
Industrie have not indicated that this
1500 feet in VMC should be above ground
level. When this was pointed out to
Mr. Guyot they have accepted the error.
However this bulletin is current even
now as we have not been infonned Of
any cancellation or supplied with a
revised bulletin. If we accept the
Inspector of Accident' s theory on page
55 and 56 and Airbus(cid:9) s opinion
of a selection of a lower altitude to
engage Op en Descent mode, "was Cap t. Gopuj-
kar trained to set 1500 ft. on the FCU
Altitude Window, and did he implicitly
follow such a procedure". The Court cannot
137

answer this question due to non-availablity
of FCLI selection data on the DFDR.
B(32): Looking at the CVR transcript it is
observed that the two pilots have been
totally cordial through out the flight.
Capt.Gopujkar has taken great pains to
explain various aspects of this aircraft's
handling to Capt.Fernandez as this was
his first route check. All procedures
have been followed, all checklists
have been carried out. When CM1 asked
for go around during Alt Star at DFDR
seconds 232 it was not set by CM2
knowing the implications and he guided
CM1 to select vertical speed. Landing
checks were carried out after passing
below 1500 feet as Airbus Industrie
have provided-the landing check list on
the ECAM after passing below that height
above ground. Even the call for 700 feet
rate of descent by CM1 at DFDR seconds
292.5 was correct as aircraft had come
to the correct aPproach-profile. As
mentioned earlier the correctness of
their procedures has been indicated by
not following the MDA on the VOR DME
approach chart but using the later
revised Indian Airlines' MDA of 3280
feet They have followed heading
138

instructions and come on to final closer
than 7 DME. This is nothing. abnormal
as even in International airfields like
London, Paris, Frankfurt, New York, etc.
there are occasions when radar would guide
an aircraft-on to final closer to the
R/W than normal to pick up ILs or final
VOR radial, to expedite landing of this
aircraft as well as those following.
Capt.Bhujwala during his cross examina-
B(23):
tion had stated on Page 2 that "Capt.
Gopujkar adapted himself to the new
technology very well and at no time he
was critical of the same. Capt.Gopujkar
was an instructor in Boeing 727 and a
check pilot on A-220. He used to take
a lot of pains to teach the trainees.
His approach and attitude towards the
trainees was quite helpful. The trainees
used to be quite comfortable with Cart.
Gopujkar".
B(34): It should be noted that this above state-
ment has come from a long term close
associate, who joined Indian Airlines in
1969 along with Capt.Gopujkar, trained
on HS 748 when Capt.Gopujkar was his
batchmate, later when being trained on
Boeing 727 Capt.Gopujkar was again his
139

batchmate. Both of them underwent
induct' -in course together and in July 1P89
when they went to Toulouse for A-329
training they were again batchmates.
There can be no doubt that the problems
on this flight Which led to the crash
occurred only in the last few seconds.

IV - 1C
/ dounls OPINION /
(1) Whatever may be the controversy regard-
ing the technicalities of the annroach, whether
it is visual or VOR-DME, I find this controversy
has no substantial bearing to solve the problem
before me which has arisen only after 292 se-
conds. The crash occurred because something
happened between DFDR seconds 293 and 321. In
fact all the participants substantially agree
that the plane was in Droner configuration, at
about 294 seconds. It is also clear to me that
after 321 DFDR seconds it was impossible for
any one to prevent this crash having regard to
the plane's situation at or about the time
frame 320. The cause for the crash has to be
found out in between these crucial seconds
(294 to 320 seconds).
(2) The controversy was raised in connec-
tion with the switching off, of the FDs. The
idea seems to be to show that visual annroach
was adopted, but in practice not properly fol-
lowed; failure to switch off the FD is one
such failure. The pilot wit,nesses have denosed
before the Court that the plane can be landed
safely either by non-precision approach or by
visual approach even if FDs are on. If FDs
are 'on', either the auto thrust should be
disconnected and thrust controlled manually
or auto thrust should be in speed mode. If
141

an emergency is foreseen the pilots can always
push the throttles to increase the power of
the engines. Even here, engines take 8 seconds
to develop acceleration from idle; that is why
I opine that it was beyond anybody's capacity
to nrevent this crash after, TF.321.
(3)(cid:9) A strict adherence to the VOR-DME would
have kept the nlane at the proper altitude;
the procedure followed by the pilots in the
instant case kept the plane slightly at a.
higher altitude, which, did not create any
problem by itself and had no bearing on the
real situation that developed on or after, the
TF.294; pilots, obviously followed a mixed un
procedure. The plane should have moved along
11 DME arc (an imaginary arc around the Air-
nort, indicating 11 miles to the Airnort),
till'the 269° and then move straight towards
the runway direction by crossing 7 ME at
4500 feet altitude. However, the plane moved
almost straight and joined the runway direction
near 7 DME arc, being vectored by the Radar.
The fact remains that, by 292 or 294 seconds,
the nlane was in a proper situation and there
has been no dispute, alteest, on this asnect
and that, FDs could have been put off subse-
quently also if necessary. At 572 crash
seconds (7:23:45 hrs.) the ATC had directed
the plane to "des?end to 6000 feet on QNH
1017 HP turn right on to heading 140 for
142

vector visual approach R/W.09". CM.2 had
replied "Roger" and then repeated the words of
ATC. This is a specific word indicating that
CM.2 understood the instructions of the ATC.
ATC had affirmed this again to which CM.2 had
replied "Roger" (see - CVR transcription, for
crash seconds 572 to 533).
(4)(cid:9) The two experienced pilot-Assessors
have opined that, if the pilots are cleared
for visual approach in clear weather conditions
and if pilots follow an instrument let down
procedure as a back up to the visual approach
without deviating from the standard visual
approach, the procedure is an acceptable
procedure. This is so because in visual
approach, the pilot has a greater discretion
and may utilise any facility available to
assist him in judging his approach path.
Discussion on this question is, therefore,
unnecessary to find out the cause of this crash.
I find no major deviation in the approach by
the pilots.

PART IV
CHAPTER - 2
REGARDING: ( I) Touch downs
(2) CVR DFDR co- relation
DirDR data and the replay of the CVR tape has
indicated that this accident was a result of certain
events that happened during the last 35 to 37 seconds.
On many aspects, such- as co-relation of CVR with
DFDR timing, the nature of the first touch down,
the timing of the recording of 6.125 1 G' fbrce and
as to the click sound found between the words
recorded in CVR - "Hey we are going down", divergent
views have been expressed. The two sets of views
could be brought out exhaustively in the differing
opinions on these questions, amongst- the Assessors.
IV 2.A(cid:9) The reasoning of Ws.Capt.C.E..S.Rao
and Capt.Gopal is reflected in the following:
1.(cid:9) On 29th June, 1990 after carefully listening
to the last few seconds of the CVR recording
repeatedly on a suitable equipment at NAL, a metallic
click sound was noticed by one of the Assessors
(Capt.Gopal) during the phrase "Hey we are going
down" uttered by all. The sound was similar to
the click sounds observed by the Assessor on
the A-320 simulator of Indian Airlines at Hyderabad,
an A-320 aircraft of Indian Airlines at Fombay
and the A-320 simulator of Aeroformation at Toulouse.
144

Tho sound was between words GOING' and DOWN' very
close to the beginning of the word 'DOWN'(cid:9) The
sound was demonstrated to the Court and the Assessors
on 2nd July, 1990 and to the representatives of
the participants on 4th July,1990. The representatives
of Airbus Industrie indicated that the click sounds
could be from any of the 4 items below:
(i) Cockpit door closing due to not having
been closed but left free to move.
(ii) Pulling of sidestick controls to the
full aft position to the mechanical stop.
(iii) Thrust lever movement and
(iv) Shaking of the pilot' s or copilot' s
seat. As this had come from the manu-
facturers, further investigations were
carried out.
2.(cid:9) The Assessors visited Hyderabad during
mind July. On 17th July, the Assessors went on board
an A-320 aircraft VT-MDJ and recorded the sounds
generated by the above four items with engines
running close to VT-EPN rpm and without engines
running both on a hand held cassette tape recorder
and on the CVR. The microphone of the cassette
recorder had been hold close to Area Microphone
location. Capt.S.T.Deo, Director of Training
of Indian Airlines assisted by Capt.Johnson and
another A-320 pilot carried out various actions
as reque sted by Assessors to obtain these records
VT-EPJ was an aircraft which had been registered
145

earlier than 7..7-EPN. During the recordings, the
pilots seats did not shake or generate any noise
even when the pilots tried to shake the seats with
a lot of fbrce while sitting on the seats. The
sidessticks generated a SWISH' sound when pulled
fast to the aftmost position. No metallic sound
was heard, let alone a multiple metallic click
comparable to the click sound on the VT-EPT
CVR. Capt.Deo mentioned that pull forces during
flight in the air would be higher than that on
ground by design. The clicks generated by the
door being banged shut and thrust lever movement
from Climb to TOGA were similer. The door had
to be banged shut for it to go through both
locking stop's. Slow movement could not close the
door fully. Also, a very good magnetic latch was
available to secure the door in the open position
and force was needed to release the door from
this latch before banging the door shut. These
tapes (CVR and audio cassette) were analysed by
NAL(cid:9) d compared with the VT-EPN CVR recording
of the clicks in question. At this time frame,
there is no likelihood of anyone entering or
going out of the Cockpit, as crew Wre directed
to position themselves for landing by about 35 to
37 seconds earlier.
3.(cid:9) At one stage there was a doubt about the
identity of the pilot who had uttered the phrase
"Hey we are going clown". 1'1174 were requested
to identi fy the speaker, if possible. However,
et a later date, 14:1-s.Goplijic5r, wife of Capt.Copujkar,
146

visited Bangalore and after listening to the CVR
tape confirmed that the voice was not that of
Capt.Gopujkar but it was Capt.Fernandez who had
uttered the said phrase. The methodology used by
NAL was to determine the characteristic signatures
associated with different sounds and to co-relate
them with the signatures of known sources such as
human voices, cool-Tit door, closures, thrust levF
movement from climb t<1 TOGA etc. In respect of
voices of Capt.Gopulkar and Capt.Fernandez the
above signatures were obtained from an earlier
part of the VT-EPN CVR recording which were I ater
compared with the voice of the person who uttered
the phrase "Hey we are going down". Simil arl y
the cockpit door closure, thrust lever movement
from climb to TOGA etc. which had been recorded
on VT-ITJ at Hyderabad by the Assessors was co :p e r e
with sounds available on the(cid:9) EPN CVP, tru e.
4.(cid:9) The signatures were defined by the cepstram
of the Signal. Using the shuttling feature of
the RACAL recorded it was possible to extract
different speech segments and sounds of the CVR
or the audio tape and then separately recorded
these segments on an audio cassette recorder with
appropriate connotation. The separated segments
were analysed using digital signal processing
techniques particularly cep strum analysis.
Conclusions were based on comparision of the
analysed cepstra plots.
147

The equipment used were:
(i) RACAL model STORE 4 DS 4 channel Instrument-
ation Tape Recorder with Transcription and Analysis
Controller model TAC 4.
Rockland Multi channel Signal Processor
model 804A.
(iii) National Portable Stereo Component System
model RX CW55.
(iv) Masscomp 5600 Real Time Computer System.
(v) Honeywell Vicicorder model 1858.
The following were the observations during
the analysisz
(1) The cepstrum corresponding to Capt.Gopujkar' s
voice was characterised by a distinct peak at
8;5 milli seconds.
(2) The -cepstrum corresponding to Capt.Fernandez
voice had a characteristic peak at 6.7 milli seconds.
(3) The cepstrum of the speech "Hey we are
going down" revealed a distinct peak close to
7 milli seconds. This clearly identifies the
speaker of the above phrase as Capt.Fernandez.
(4) Using the shuttling feature of RACAL
recorder it was confirmed that the metallic click
sound during the phrase "Hey we are going down"
occurs between the 1,,,ords "going" and "down". The
cepstrum of the above metallic click so und is
characterised by two peaks at 3 and 7.2 milli seconds.
148

(5) The cepstrym of the sounds generated during
the throttle lever movement from climb to UOGA in
VT-EPJ at Hyderabad also shows two characteristic
peaks at 3 and 7.2 milli seconds.
(6) The cepstrum of the sound generated during
the cabin door closure of VT-EPJ :has two characteri-
stic peaks at 4.8 and 9.5 milli seconds. These
were very clearly different from the pattern observed
fivm the throttle lever movement from climb to TOGA.
(7) The cepstrum of the sound of cabin dbor
closure at the beginning ,of the CVR. recording of
VT-=I: (most probably by the hostess who had come
into the cockpit earlier humming "Ke sara Sara
whatever will be will be") shows two characteristic
peaks at 5.2 and 9.3 milli seconds which is close
to the cepstrum of the door closure of VT-EPJ
indicated above.
NAL Scienti sts have drawn the following final
conclusions:
( a) The speaker of the phrase "Hey we are
going down" is Capt.Fernandez.
( b) The metallic click sounds in the .phrase
"He,y we are going down" occurs between the words
!T
",o4- (cid:9) n,"(cid:9) c- n(cid:9) d "down .
(c) The metallic click sounds heard on the
0'7R bet',,,r,c.n the wor(7s "going" and "down" is not
due to the cabin door closure but is compatible
with the sound made by the throttle lever movement.
149

5.(cid:9)
From the nature of the multiple click sounds
which closely resembled the sounds generated by
either the cockpit door closure or by the thrust lever
movement from Climb to TOGA and the above conclusions
by the scientists of NAL that the metallic click
sound between the wcrds "going" and "down" correspond:;
to the moving of the thrust levers from Climb
to LGA by the crew of the ill-fated aircraft.
From the DFDR data it 'is observed that thrust
lever movement should have occurred between time
frames 324.906 and 326.781 seconds. Airbus
Industrie have indicated in their letter No.AI/E FS
420.0218/90 dated 25-9-1990 that the minimum and
maximum time to process the TLA (Thrust Lever Angle)
signal from the TLA transmitter to the instant
it is recorded on the DFDR are 183 and 423 milli
seconds. An average time figure of 0.3 seconds
as indicated by them is considered good for use.
As the time fbr the sound of the thrust
lever movement to travel from the thrust lever
guadrant to the area microphone is almost instantaneous
compared to 0.3 seconds delay for the thrust lever
angle to be recorded on the DFDR, it would mem
that on the CVR the click sounds referred above
should be between the times of 324.606 and
326.481. These figures would be in terms of
co-relation with the DFDR time frames.
150

6. To obtain a good correlation between the
CVR and DFDR a continuous UV (Ultra Violet)
recording for a little over 40 seconds from the
end of the GVii recording was taken. It was
recorded on Honey-well type Vicicorder after
synchronising the tape speed using 400 Hz invertor
frequency as the reference. Recording was done
at a paper speed,of 16 inches per second with
a spacing of 0?1 second between the two vertical
time divisions. The first identified phrase in
this recording is "OK 700 feet rate of descent".
For computation purposes a reference time 0 was
given to the end of the CVR recording and the
times were measured backwards with a negative sign.
Listening very carefully to the last few
sounds of the CITR recording it is observed that
the crash sounds exist for a period of 2.4 seconds
before `the CVR stopped recording. in addition
it is observed that there is an audible sound as
if something was breaking just prior to the
termination of the CVR recording.
7. Coming to the physical evidence left behind
during the second touch down of VT-EPN it was
observed that all three gears of VT-E2N had
left a deep indentation on the 17th green of
the golf course prior to the impact with the
embankment. The nose gear of the aircraft is
very close to and below the pilots cabin. The
nose gear deeply digging into the ground including
the axle between the wheels also causing
indentatipn would create severe noises inside
151

the cockpit. All three guars digging into the
ground End the right engine nacelle also dragging
on the raised ground on the 17th green would cause
severe deceleration of the aircraft. From the
nature of these indentations, it is evident that
the aircraft has taken almost 2.4 seconds from
the time of the second impact till the impact of
the bottom surface of the fuselage or the nose
gear with the embankment. Most probably, the
noise which appeared to be of some component•
breaking just before the CVR stopped recording,
could be the impact of the nose gear with the
embankment whilst the fuselage of the aircraft
went sliding on top of the embankment. At this
time the power supply for the CVR must have failed
resulting in the stoppage of the CVR recording.
The DFDR has stopped recording after word No.23
of the time frame 331 has been recorded.
Words No.24(cid:9)
d 25 would not have been recorded
at Bangalore due to non-availability of localiser
or glide slope. Word No.26 which was EGT engine
1;0.2 has not been recordel. Hence it is estimated
that DFDR has stopped -working between time
frames 331.375 and 331.406 seconds or 331.4 seconds.
8.(cid:9)
The DFDR needs AC power supply for the bus.
The CVR power supply is available from the battery
t'nrou7h the invertor. The very heavy impact
with the ground at the time the aircraft touched
152

the ground within the golf course just short of
the embankment may have possibily cut out the
power supply to the DFDR due to loss of AC power
supply to the DFDR while the CVR could have easily
continued working with power supply from the
batteries. It is the opinion of the two Assesors
(Capt.Rao & Capt.Gopal) that the DFDR stopped
working at the time of the second impact
the ground and the CVR continued working for
2.4 seconds till the power supply of the CVR was
cut when the aircraft fuselage under surface impac':e,
the embankment and for a good co-relation of the
CVR end DFDR they say that the commencement of
crash sounds should be assigned the time of 331.4
seconds DFDR time and the end of CVR would
correspond to the DFDR time frame of 333.8 seconds
if DFDR had continued working. They further
estimate that the click sounds between the words
"going" and "down" in the phrase "Hey we are
going down" has occurred from 9.18 to 9.13 seconds
from the end of the CVR recording. This would
correspond to the DI4DR time francs of 324.620 and
324.670 seconds. Referring to the earlier computation
of DFDR time for thrust lever movement on the
CVR as between 324.606 and 326.481, the time of
324.620 to 324.670 falls within this range and
hence it is considered to be correct. The
reasoning given by the two Assessors are:
153

9.(i) There was a school of thought that the final
sounds of the CVR, which is referred to as crash
sounds earlier, was due to a very hard first touch
down on the golf course causing 6 Hz vibration of
the structure of the aircraft, which in turn gave
rise to a high level of sounds in the cockpit and
the CVR recording. As the- CVR is a direct audio
recover using microphones located within the
cockpit, Indian Airlines was requested to send
the specifications of the microphones and the CVR
receivers. The data has been made available to
the Court. The noise level in decibels originated
by a 6Hz vibration of the structure would have to
be so very high for it to come within the range
of the specifications of the microphones and the
CVR for recording purposes. Such audio noise
generation from a very low frequency structural
vibration of 6Hz is unimaginable. In addition,
continuous crash sounds have existed for a
period of 2.4 seconds. The aircraft after the
first touch down has flown for a distance of nearly
234 feet which would take approximately 1.23 seconds
at the speeds recorded on the DFDR. Air is a
very good damper for any vibration of an aircraft
structure when it is flying in the air. Severe
turbulance during flight can cause very low
frequency vibrations of the aircraft wings, osci-
llations of podded engines etc. and the two
pilot Asse ssors with their cumulative nearly
154

4000 hours of flight experience have never experienced
such high levels of audio recordable nose similar
to that of VT-EPN CVR.lo there is no further
intesification of the crash sounds after the second
impact which was far more severe than the first
touch down. If such noise levels could be generated
by a 6Hz structural vibration in the cockpit,
similar nose should have occurred in the cabin
also. No survivor witness has indicated any
high unusual noise after the first touch down.
Further, if DFDR time of 329.937 which is the
time at which 6.125 g has been recorded is
considered as the time fbr commencement of crash
sounds) the end of the- crash sounds would correspond
to 332.337. This would mean that the thrust
lever movement sounds as determined earlier
would have occurred at 323.157 to 323.207 DFDR
seconds. This is well outside the DFDR recorded
thrust lever angle at TOGA. Hence this opinion
has to be discarded.
(ii) Though the DPDR time frame range for
the TLA position at TOGA could be between 324.906
and 326.781, aly movement of the identified thrust
lever clicks towards the higher value cannot
be considered because the radio altitude call
outs would have a very big discrepancy. Fbr
example) if thrust lever movement time is given
as 326 seconds, with the knowledge that the
aircraft was on the ground at 329.8, the UV
recording would show that the aircraft would
the chime and the subsequent sink rate
be between-
15F

call. If the thrust lever movement is given the
time of 325 seconds, the time of first touch down
would occur during the sink rate thirty call. Thus
it can be seen that the time of 324.620 to 324.670
seconds which has been indicated earlier as the
time during which the thrust lever has been moved
gives a very good co-relation between. the DFDR
and the CVR. The aircraft is on the ground at
the time it should be on the ground as per DFDR data•
(iii) The phrase "Sink Rate Thirty" was used
in the previous paragraph. From repeated•listening
of the CVR tape, it appears that it is "Sink
Rate Thirty" and not "Sink Rate Fifty". However
it is necessary to mention that this can only
be observed by repeated shuttling of the tape
on a suitable equipment with possibility of reduction
in tape speed and frequency filtration. Also,
it would correspond well Id thin physical evidence
of the first touch down and the radio altitude
values on the DFDR.
(iv) Based on this time determination of thrust
lever movement to TOGA and identification of certain
important phrases during the last 40 seconds
(using the UV recording) the co-relation of CVPI.
and DFDR has been carried out. Even though the
ground below the aircraft during the last 40 seconds
was very uneven, giving rise to the recorded
radio altitudes the auto radio altitude call outs
156

do correspond well. The impcat time with the
embankment corresponding to CVR stoppage would be
close to 07433a) hours UTC or 13:03:20 hours IST.
The aircraft has covered another 430 feet before
coming to a final stop. At about 85 to 90 "'mots
on leaving the embankment and to a sliding stop,
the aircraft could have taken 4 to 5 seconds.
Hence, aircraft it estimated to have reached final
position at 07:33:25 hours or 13:03:25 hours IST.
(v) The Court and the Assessors proceeded to
NAL on 6th November11990 to listen to the CVR tape
again as there was a difference in the time
indication of the radio altitude auto callout
of "Three Hundred" and the CM2 call out of
"You are descending on idle open descent ah all
this time" in the CVR transcript from CAS/3 and
the transcript prepared by two pilot Assessors
after co-relation.
In the co-relation from ChS)37 the call out
of "You are descending on idle open descent ah
all this time" is shown against DFDR time 304.9.
The call out "Three Hundred" has been shown against
time 305.3.
The pilot Assessors had shown the call of
"Three Hundred" before the other CM2 call out.
The call "Three Hundred" was against DFDR time
303.7 seconds and the CM2 call "You are descending
on idle open descent ah all this time" was from
305.5 to 306.6.(cid:9)
157

After listening to the various channels of
the CVR recording at NAL by the Court and the
Assessors, it was established that the "Three
Hundred" call was before the CM2 call "You are
descending on idle open descent ah all this time".
However "Hundred" in the "Three Hundred" appears
to have overlapped the first two words of the
CM2 call namely "you are". These two words "You
are" are very clear in the CM2 call on the CM2
microphone channel. "Hundred" and "You are" which
are overlapping are shown in brackets in the
CVR-DFDR transcript below (It is necessary to
note here the timing co-relation was not done
by the NAL, but by the two Assessors).
( vi) Timing against important CVR phrases
only, are indicated below. These timings
indicate the tprt of the phrase or cp1lout
or occurrence. Where considered important the
time taken for the full phrase or call out is
indicated to nearest decimal of a second.
Crash seconds are accounted for from the time of
DFDR stoppage at 331.4 seconds which corresponds
to start of crash sounds. This has been used
as Inspector of Accidents also has taken crash
seconds as 0 at start of crash sounds.

10. REGARDING FIRST TOUCH DOWN:
The aircraft first touched the ground in the
grounds of the Karnataka Golf Club approximately
2300 feet short of the beginning of R/W 09 of
Bangalore Airport. The wheel marks on the ground
during this touch down were for a distance of approxi—
mately 82 feet .(cid:9) Only the main gears had touched
the ground and there were no wheel marks from the
nose gear. The DFDR data has shown that the radio
altitude at 329.953 seconds was 0 feet. The radio
altitude at 328.953 seconds was 12 feet and the radio
altitude at 330.953 seconds was 2 feet. The ground
speed recorded at time franes 328.734, 329.734 and
330.734 is 116 knots while the CAS was 112.78,
113.03 and 110.28 at 328.234, 329.234 and 330.234
respectively. As the accuracy of ground speed
recording is +. 8 knots and the CAS recording
accuracy is + 1 knot, considering an average CAS
of 112 Imots at these very lot• radio altitudes it
would take .43 seconds to cover 82 feet after which
the aircraft went up into the air. Also the DFDR
normal acceleration at time frames 329.687,, 329.812,
329.937, 330.062, 330.187 and 330.312 are 1.06250,
2.78125, 6.125000, 3.01563, 1.57813 and 0.01563
respectively. The maximum normal acceleration recording
of 6.12600 has been at 329.937 seconds.
11. Mrs9 Sadhana Pawar joined Indian Airlines in
1982 and is now a senior Airhostess with Indian Airlines.
160

is one of the survivors of this accident. She
She
was assigned duties at the rear of the aircraft during
this flight. She was the airhostess who opened the
rear left main door through which quite a few passengers
were able to escape. She is an experienced cabin
crew member and she has stated both in her affidavit
and during her deposition that the first touch down
was quite normal. In the affidavit she has stated:
The aircraft's first touch down there
was nothing abnormal felt or heard. The
first touch down seemed to be like an
average landing".
In her deposition she has stated:
" The first touch down of the plane did
not give any impression that there was
an abnormality and I thought it was a
normal landing".
Mrs.Neela Sawant is another airhostess who
survived from the accident. She was also seated at
the rear of the aircraft when the accident occurred.
She joined Indian Airlines in 19 82 and presently she
is a senior Airhostess. In her affidavit she has
stated as below:
"Befb re the first touch down there was
no thing abnormal heard or felt in the
aircraft and seemed to be an average
1 anding".
161

In her deposition she has stated as below:
"There were three impacts altogehter
and the last one resulted in the plane
stopping finally. However the first
impact gave me impression that it was
a normal landing".
Again during ctross-examination she has confirmed
as below:
"The first landing gave the impression
that it was a very normal landing".
A surviving passenger, Sri.Hemchand Jaichand,
who is a bank official, occupying seat 21A C a window
seat on the left side) has deposed as below:
"Before the first touch down I saw
barren fields and the plane was almost
level to the fields but even then
I thought it was a normal landing".
During cross-examination he stated:
"The first touch down was not a smooth
touch down but something like a landing
in an airport situated at a hig her
altitude as in the case of Bajpe airport,
even then I did not experience any unusual
feeling while landing".
He also stated at a later time:
" Though I thought it was a normal
landing at the first touch down, still
162

it was rough. Most of the times I welt
to Mangalore I had experienced the same
kind of landing".
Mr.E.S.Sridhar, •a survivor, who is an Engineer,
was occupying seat 27D (an aisle seat) is a frequent
air traveller. He has stated:
"The first touch down was a mild one and
I thought we had landed on the R/W".
During cross examination he has stated:
"The first touch down did not give me
any jolt". Mr.Kumar Nadig, an Industrial
Designer was occupying seat 12C ( an aisle
seat) at the time of the crash. He also
held a private pilot's licence which has
expired. During his deposition he has
stated:
"It was quite a hard touch down in the
initial stage. It was too quick and
unusually hard impact. The second impact
was much more severe than the first.
After the second impact I think the plane
came to a final stop".
The two surviving airhostesses have had 7 to 8 years
experience as cabin crew. Flying has been their
profession and they would have had plenty of experience
to judge a normal landing or a very hard landing. Both
have stated that there were three impacts out of which
163

the first was a normal landing. Mrs. Sadhana Pawar
has stated that the second impact was heavy and
terrible and the third which was the final stop
was on a marshy land. Mrs.Neela Sawant has stated
that on the second impact she was thrown out of
floor and she was still
her seat and fell on the
on the floor when the third impact occurred.
Mr. Hemchand jaichEnd has stated that within
a very short time after the first touch down the
plane thudded against a hard surface. He has
also observed the signs going off after the
second touch down though he had been injured
and was bleeding throtth the nose.
Mr. Sridhar has stated that at the time of
Asecond impact he had fallen forward and the
seat belt had snapped and the plane stopped at
the third impact.
The only person who has said that the first
touch down was a hard touch down is Mr. Kumar
Nadig but he has also stated that the second impact
was more severe than the first and he suffered
injuries only after the second impact. He has
not deposed about any third impact and be felt
that the aeroplane came to a stop after the
second impact. The possibility of Mr.Nadig not
having remembered the first touch down due to
its smoothness does exist. He was sitting in
an aisle seat with an adult lady by his side in
the center seat and a child in the window seat
164

and hence his vision through the window would
be severely restricted.
12.(cid:9) The Court and the Assessors had visited
the crash site a few days after the crash at the
earliest possible opportunity after a formal-
investigation was ordered by Government of India.
All telltale marks were fully evident at that
time as nothing had been distrubed except to clear
some debris at the embankment and on the road
parallel to the embanlvnent. Photographs taken
by the team from Government of India, Civil
Aviation Department immediately after the accident
are available with the Court. These photographs
have been filed as Fx.46 series. There are
certain significant observations to be considred
in respect of the ground over which the aircraft
rolled during the first touch down. The
photographs 46( 1) 46( 2), 46( 3) 1 46( 5) 1 46( 6)
and 46(20) which were taken immediately after
the accident are very pertinent with respect to
this portion of the area of the golf ground where
the first touch down took place. Photographs
46(6) and 46(20) clearly show the undulating
nature of the ground. Photographs 46(2) 7 46( 3)
and 46(5) clearly show that during the 82 feet
roll the ground surface had considerable undulations
in the mid part of the wheel marks. There was
a sudden dip in the ground of approximately 3 inches
165

as observed by the Court and ,some Assessors on
their numberous visits to the crash site. This
depression was more' predominant in the left wheel
track area compared to the right wheel track
area. The whole surface of the full 82 feet
of the first touch down was grassy land which
was fairly dry at the time of the crash. From
Ex.46(2) we can make out the undulating ground
even in the right Hand wheel track marks. Looking
at photograph Ex.48(.1) which is a close up view
of the initial touch down point of the first
touch down, it is observed that hardly any
indentation has been made by the wheels. It
should be remembered that at this point the
wheels of the aircraft would have been stationary
and at the time of touch down tim friction between
the tyre and the ground would start the wheels
rotating as well as treat severe erosion of
the top surface. Just beflore this touch cbwn
at right angles to the wheel marks we can also
see a.mark left by possibly a wheel 'borrow.
This is our assumption as there is only one track
th,t is observed in this photograph. In the
same photogr h it is apparent that the depth
of the impression left by the aforesaid wheel
barrow appears to be more than that created by
the aircraft wheels. Also a careful observation
of his photograph indicates grass being seen
in the area of the tyre marks. Photograph 46(5)
166

again shows a marking left by an equipment like
a wheel barrow running parallel to the wheel marks
indicating that the top surface of the whole area
was similar in nature, One question that needs
to be answered is whether Fin aircraft at a weight
of 58 tons coming down and hitting the ground
at a normal acceleration of 6.125 g or greater
and at a speed of about 115 knots can leave a
wheel mark- wherein even the grass of a soft
top layer has not been 11E:moved by the friction
created between the wheels and the ground when
the wheels have to start rotation. This would
only be possible if the aircraft touches the
ground very lightly and the weight of the aircraft
gradually settles onto the ground. Though
soil testing which was carried out had indicated
a fairly hard surface underneath the area of
the.first touch down compared to the soil strength
of the area of the second touch down, it is
evident from these photographs that the top
surface of the ground in the area of discussion
was fairly soft because of the wheel barrow
marks. This type of impression, with the grass
remaining at the point of intial contract can
only occur if the Contact between the stationary
wheels and the ground is very light and there
was no severe friction.
Ex.94 is a DFDR data of the landing of
13.(cid:9)
the same aircraft VT,.EPN about 6 landings earli er.
167

The various rtcorded accelerations are in the data
of the exhibit. This was filed before the Court
by Airbus Industrie representatives. From the
pressure altitude it appears that this landing
was at Bangalore itself. After the aircraft had
touched down, at a slightly later time during
the landing roll, normal acceleration had shown
a sudden increase. When this increase in normal
acceleration was brought to the notice of
Mr. Gerard Guyot his answer was:
" I do not see other explanation than
the aircraft could may be have been on
a particular rough R/W because it could
happen that W surface have significant
irregularities%
He also confirmed that the same bFDR was on board
VT-EPN at the time of the crash.
14.(cid:9) Though Mr. Guyot was sent as an expert
by Airbus Industrie and was supposed to be competent
to interpret the DFDR data) during cross examination
by the learned Counsel of Indian Airlines, lir.Guyot
has stated that he expected fuel flow readings
after' the first touch down if the touch down had
a vertical velocity compared to a normal landing
(page 18). From the time after the first touch
down, till the time DFDR stopped recording, by
design there was no possibility of a fuel flow
recording. The next recording of the fuel flow
would have come for engine-1 at 331.781 and for
engine-2 at 331.906 DFDR seconds. The DFDR
168

had stopped working at 331.4. During questioning
by an Assessor, Mr.Guyot agreed that this was the
first accident wherein he was interpreting DFDR data
in respect of normal, lateral and longitudinal
accelerations of.the magnitude experienced in
this crash (page 97). From this it has to be
inferred that Mr.Guyot was not an experienced
expert witness to give an opinion on the proper
recording of the gs, values.
15.(cid:9) The Court had requested the Airbus Industrie
to carry out certain manoeuvres on an aircraft
similar to thos9 of Indian Airlines and fitted
with V-2500 engines. DFDR data of that flight
was requested for. The flight was carried out
on 20-6-1990 at Toulouse. The DFDR data of the
flight was made available to the Court. The
duration of the flight was for a period' of
1 hour.45 minutes. Only a few minutes data
were requested for by the Court. Fbur profiles
at very high angles of attack were carried out•.
One was a repeat of the Bangalore scenario.
The second profile was under direct law initiating
TOGA at the onset of stall warning and continuing
flight at an angle of attack to get intermittent
stall warning. The third was recovery at stall
speed +12 Kts approximately. The fourth was
engine acceleration at high angles of attack.
The total duration of the DFDR data made available
to the Court (which covered these four profiles)
169

was 9 minutes and 52 seconds. Eight seconds data
from 15:10:36 to 15: 10:43 UM (inclusive) could not
be retrieved from the DFDR. In the remaining
- 151
9 minutes 52 seconds, there were a total of
erroneous recordings on the DFDR. These included
26 erroneous readings of normal acceleration,
17 readings of longitudinal acceleration and 11
readings of lateral acceleration. Throughout
the period this data,was collected, the aircraft
was in flight. One of the Assessors was on board
this flight as an observer.
The acceleration values recorded during this
flight varied from —7.37488 to +5.96992. Such
values can never be achieved by this aircraft both
by design or by even very violent manoeuvting .
It is extremely surprising andsignificant to note
that the errors in the acceleration values have
occurred only after a profile at high angles of
attack was carried out. During the part of the
flight prior to initiating the profiles and
getting in to the high angle of attack segment,
no such acceleration errors occurred. Also, it
was observed from the data that at certain times
incorrect acceleration figures have been recorded
in an isolated mariner and sometimes in groups
of 2, 3, 4 or even 5 consecutive readings of the
same acceleration parameters. -This does indicate
)
that there is a definite possibility of incorrect
acceleration readings being recorded by the DFDR
after a flight segment at very high angles of attack.
170

This was ;the case during the la,,t flight segment
of VT-EPN till the first toucil down. The possi-
bility of the normal acceleration recordings in
the VT-EPN DFDR data at the time of first touch
down being incorrect cannot be ruled out. It would
be necessary fbr the Airbus Industrie to carefully
examine the design aspects of the accelerometers
and the DFDR recording to overcome this problem.
Scrutiny of the VT-EPN DFDR data indicates
that the radio altitudes recorded at 326.953,
328.95!1
327.953/and 329.953 seconds were ,601 301 12 and
0 feet respectively. The pressure altitudes
recorded against time frames 329 and 330 appears
to be in error. The pressure altitude difference
and radio altitude difference shown against
326, 327 and 328 seconds co-relate fairly well,
but for 329 and 330 they do not co-relate even
allowing for certain uneven ground observed
in that area (cid:9) At the speed that existed, the aircraft
would have been abotit 195 feet horizontally
behind the point of first touch down 1 second
earlier to that touch down. There was no very
significant high ground to consider the radio
altitude against DFDR time frame 328.953 as
erroneous. On the contrary, there was a slight
depression in the ground in that area. There is
a posSibility that the radio altitude figure
of 12 feet may not have been the height of the
aircraft above the altitude of the point of the
first touch down. It could have been less by a few
feet. Me same can be seen also by the comparison

of pressure altitudes recorded against time
frames 327 and 328. Hence it is possible that
the aircraft was only about 10 feet (or even less)
at the time 1 second prior to first touch down.
16.(cid:9) It is common knowledge that in these
jet transport aircraft during take off on rotation
a rate of descent is indicated on the VSI though
the aircraft is on tiya ground and trying to-
get airborne. Indications become normal and
correct after the aircraft gets airborne and
stabilised in climb. Pressure sensing instruments
cannot be relied upon at heights very close to
the ground. This would include pressure altitude
instruments and readings. For aircraft approaching
the ground at even normal approach angles, the
pressure altitude readings may not be correct
both because of altimeter setting and possible
higher pressure sensing due to ground effect.
11r.Guyot during his cross examination has
concurred with the suggestion that ground effect
causes errors in static pressure measurements.
This is the veason why radio altitudes which
are more accurate are used for Auto land and
Category III landings. It is therefore necessary
for us not to consider the pressure sensed
measurements during the last 2 or 3 seconds,
but rely upon the radio altitude data.
172

17. Looking at the pitch angles from DFDR times
324 to 329, it is observed that there has been
a continuous increase in pitch altitude. At 328.641,
the angle of attack has reached the maximum
recorded value. This is just about 1 second from
first touch down. The elevators have also started
moving upwards in the last few seconds prior
to the first touch down. Altitude loss per
second has shown a reduction from 30 feet between
time frames 326 and 327 to 18 feet between 327
and 328 and 12 feet between 328 and 329. If
we consider what we have stated earlier whilst
looking at the radio altitudes, then during
the last 1 second, the altitudes loss would have
been even less. This clearly shows that the
aircraft was in the process of recovery from
a very high sink rate during the last 3 seconds
prior to the first touch down. It is possible
that this aircraft did touch down fairly smoothly
at the time of the first touch dolin with a very
light contact at the point of initial touch
down. The normal acceleration data that have
been recorded cannot be relied upon because of
the type of data that has been recorded in
the Airbus Industrie test flight and because of
non-co-relation with other parameters of flight
during the last few seconds.
18. VT-EPN was experiencing a tailwind component
during its final approach. At the initial stages
173

it was about 8 to 9 knots at time frame 296. .The
tail wind component continued during the flight
with approximately a 7 knots component till
about 321 seconds and increased to 9 knots at
323. From then on till the first touch down the
tailwind component reduced. The photographs of
the burning aircraft published by some of the
Magazines indicated the smoke travelling from
the front towards the rear of the crashed aircraft
and also towards the right of the crashed aircraft.
This indicated a east north easterly wind
direction. Hence it is evident that prior to
the first touch down the aircraft had experienced
a head wind component. A change from a tailwind
component to a head wind component increases
the performance under any conditions of flight.
The LAS would increase and also the aircraft
would tend to gain height at the same angle of
attack. This would mean that VT-EPN which was
having a high- sink rate would have been assisted
by this wind change in its performance by
reducing the sink rate; this would have contributed
to arresting the sink rate just prior to the
first touch down.
19.(cid:9) Though 6.125 g has been recorded during
the first touch down, it is necessary to note that
no part or even a panel had been shed by the
aircraft between the first End the second touch downs.
174

The first Shedding of parts started only after
the second touch down and the right engine cowling
was riding the raised ground near the 17th green
of the golf course. The photograph Ex.46(20)
clearly shows where the shedding of aircraft
components/parts commenced. Two of the Assessors
had personally seen the type of damage that would
occur after a high g' impact. In the Doeing 707
crash at Bombay in June 1982, the vertical
acceleration recorded was a little over 5 g.
The No.2 engine fell off after the impact and
some other parts and panels of the aircraft had
been shed before the aircraft came to a final
stop though the aircraft had rolled for a
short period on its landing gears and subsequently
had a very short hop before the final impact.
It is very difficult to imagine that this
aircraft VT-EPN would not have shed any components
if 6.125 g recorded was indeed the correct figure.
Mr.Ronald W.Weaver an accident investigator
with International Aero Engines stated that it
was common within the industry that DFDR data
recorded after a 6 g impact cannot be valid.
He quoted an accident to a DC 9 aircraft of
Airborne Express at Philadelphia in 1985 wherein
the aircraft had a 6 g impact and no parts of
the aircraft had been shed immediately after that
impact. The Court was able to obtain complete
data of this accident and it was found that the maximum
9 recorded at the time of impact was only 2.76 g
175

and the aircraft had shed lot of parts and
components immediately after the impact (Ex.143)
Mr.Weaver,,t x)wever(cid:9) , after his return to USA
realised his incorrect statement and sent a letter
indicating the correct information in respect of
this acel.:Iont,_ It is not possible to agree
with the contention that -DFDR data would be
invalid just because a normal acceleration in
excess of 6 g has been recorded. The Court is
not in possession of any documentation which
can justify such a contention based on previous
accident investigation records. As DFDR data
recorded could be in error, every parameter has
to be carefully evaluated against evidence available
prior to accepting or discarding the data.
20.(cid:9) Mr.Gerard Guyot, in a technical note
dated 10-7-1990 (Ex.95), has explained the
reasoning for coming to the conclusion of the
first touch down being in excess of 6 g. Only
pressure altitudes have been utilised far this
computation. Ground effect had not been considered
as per his deposition during cross examination
(page 24). We cannot agree to this computation
as the other valid parameters, physical evidence
and survivor statements do not tally with this
opinion.
Mr.Gerard Guyot during his deposition on
page 10 has stated that if the aircraft had
touched down with a vertical acceleration of
6.125 g at the centre(cid:9) gravity, the vertical
176

acceleration would be 1:1(cid:9) level(cid:9) the
cockpit, 12.2 g at the ievc1 c the electilJnic bay
and 17 g in the rear park(cid:9) _.e fuselage. in spite
of the estimated 17 g vertical acceleration, the
two airhostesses occupying seats at the rear end
of the cabin and Mr.Sridhar occupying seat 27D
have stated that first touch down was a normal
landing. Mr.J'aichand in seat 21A which is also
towards the rear paM of the cabin has stated
that it was a normal landing. Even though one
witness sitting over the wing close to the centre
of gravity felt that it was hard, it must be
remembered that the aircraft had touched down
on a golf course with a shallow area in the middle
part of the first touch down. Passage over this
shallow area may have caused the impression of
a hard touch down to this witness. An aircraft
in flight is a moving object whose profile
is continuously changing particularly under the
conditions experienced by VT-EPN in the last
few seconds before the crash.
21.(cid:9) Taking into consideration all the evidence
before the Court, it is our considered opinion
that this aircraft was in the process of changing
its flight profile and arresting the sink rate
when it touched down smoothly in the golf course
for the first time before going up into the air
again.
177

REGARDING SECOND IMPACT:
22. After the first touch down Ell d rolling
on the ground for a distance of 82 feet on the
main gears only, the aircraft went up into the
air and Came down rather violently at the time
of the second touch down. The aircraft had
covered a distance of 234 feet from the end of
the first touch down to the beginning of the
decond touch down.
23. This short flight was for a duration of
approximately 1.2 seconds at the speeds recorded
on the DFDR. There were a few small trees on
the golf grounds between the two touch downs whicil
were hit by the aircraft End cut during this
short skip. One tree in line with the left engine
was broken approximately 10 feet from, the ground.
One in line with the left main gear was broken
approximately 9 feet from the ground and two trees
on the right were cut at approximately 8 feet
4 inches and 7 feet 2 inches by the right hand
enginG and the gear. These trees had jagged
edges at the top which would indicate that the
impact point of the aircraft structure against
the tree should have been higher than the remaining
height of the tree. Also as a sink rate warning
had been generated just before the second impact,
by the design of the GPWS this aircraft must have
attained a height greater than 10 feet before
the aircraft came down aid had the second impact.
178

24.(cid:9) Referring to FCOM 1.09.10 page 8, the
flight mode changes to landing mode when radio
altitude of 50 feet is passed. Considering the
flight before the first touch down the aircraft
would have been in landing mode on passing
50 feet radio altitude. This would have occurred
about air seconds prior to the first touch down.
Reference FCOM 1.09.10 page 7, on the ground
above 70 knots, the maximum deflection of the
elevator is 20° up and down. During the first
touch down both pilots were holding the sidesticks
fully back. The moment the aircraft was no longer
in flight but on the ground (during the first
touch down), the angle of attack would have
changed. The high angle of attack VT-EPN experienced
during the last few seconds would change to a
value close to pitch altitude at the time of touch
down ( angle of incidence of the wing has to
be accounted for). The pitch angle at 328.125
was 8.79° . It is possible that the pitch
altitude could have increased to about 9° to
9.5° in the period remaining before the first
touch down. The angle of attack recorded at
329.641 was 15.65°. Immediately on touch down
it would have changed to a figure close to 9°
and the aircraft would be immediately out of
alpha protection range (which starts at i2°)
Under this condition the computers (ELAC) would
no longer dictate the position of the elevators
to maintain the maximum angle of attack. With
179

the side sticks had fully back by the pilots,
the elevators would deflect upwards to the
maximum permissible value under the present
conditions of flight namely 20°. Such a violent
movement of the elevators would create a very
severe pitch up of the aircraft. At the speed
of first touch down which was well above stalling
speed, this would surely result in an immediate
flight of the plane in a very steep nose high
altitude. All this would have occurred in
just 0.4 seconds. Elevator angle of -1.7.7° at
330.71.9 seconds confirms such movement.
25. Such movement of the aircraft does
explain the hitting and breaking of the trees
at such high measured heights even though, the
aircraft was in the air for about only 1.2 seconds
befbre it hit the ground again. It is most
likely that this elevator movement which initiated
the bounce could have taken the aircraft altitude
to a very steep angle possibly beyond the stalling
angle. The momentum of the aircraft would have
taken it upwards to a certain extent after which
the r.r.,GG would drop and the aircraft would come
down. This is evident from the way the ground
marks are, at the second impact. We do not
believe that any computer can stop the momentum
of a 58 ton aircraft in about(cid:9) to 1 second.
26. Most probably the pilots at that time
realised that they would be coming down onto
the emban1,9Dent which they would have seen during
the first touch down. It is posSible that rmring
180

that short skip and the steep attitude after
the first touch down they might have released
their hands from the sidestick controls at almost
the same time either to protect their faces or
due to the realisation of the inevitability of
a crash. It may be just a coincidence that
both SSPPC and SSPPFO have recorded the same
value against time frame 330.
27. The distance between the tree broken
at a height of 10 feet and the end of the wheel
marks of the first touch down is 118 feet.
The distance between the tree and the beginning
of the second touch down markings is only 46 feet.
This shows that the aircraft came down very
steeply at the time of the second impact after
attaining a considerable height. This also
explains the generation of the sink rate warning
as well as the 10 feet auto call out.
28. In spite of all the factual evidence
available, we are unable to understand how
Airbus Industrie could have sent a technical
Note No.AI/LE A441.082890 dated 13.9.1990
(it has been erroneously shown as 1989) wherein
they have asserted that the maximum variation
of altitude between the two main gear marks
in respect of this accident would be 0 8 meters
÷ 30%. Even allowing the maximum limit es
per their calculation it corresponds to 3 feet
5 :inches. Airbus Industrie' s explanation is
unacceptable.(cid:9) 181

29. Some of the statements of surviwr
witnesses are quite relevant. Mrs.Sadhana Pawar
during cross-examination has stated "I cannot
say whether the plane was rolling or dragging
after the first touch down and it is very difficult
to describe as I have not paid my attention on
that aspect". Mrs.Neela Sawant has stated during
her deposition "There was a sort of movement
which I cannot describe either as flying or
rolling before the second impact occurred".
30. Mr.Hemchand Jaichand during cross examination
stated "After the first touch down there was
a jerky movement of the plane though nothing
violent was experienced". Mr..E .S.Sridhar
during his deposition has stated "Between the
first and second touch down, though there was
movement, I cannot describe the nature of the
movement".
31. These statements do indicate that a
movement of the aircraft, which they could not
clearly describe, had taken place between the
first touch down and second touch-down. An
aircraft after touch down, going up very steeply
and suddenly coming down would be a type of
movement which they were only able to feel but
could not see due to their seating positions.
Though Mr.Jaichand was at a -window seat, he
has stated that he was not looking out of the window.
182

32. From the physical evidence of the broken
trees, it is apparent that the aircraft had attained
an altitude considerably higher than 10 feet with
possibily a slight right wing low altitude. Due
to the closeness of the trees to the second impact
point, the aircraft must have passed the trees
that were broken at a height greater than 10 feet
either on the way up or on the way down. Most
probably it would have been on the way down.
33. If a parabolic traverse is assumed the
height attained at the mid point between the two
touch downs would be very considerable to break
the trees in the manner observed.
34. The sink rate of the aircraft just prior
to the second impact should have been quite high
reaching an approximate vertical acceleration
value of more than 16 feet/second to generae the
sink rate warning. Airbus Industrie have
confirmed that the GPWS on board VT-MD/1 was a new
version whose lower limit for generating the
warning is 10 feet above ground. This also confirms
that the aircraft should have attained a height
greater than 10 feet during this bounce. The
very hard impact reported by all the survivor
witnesses corroborates this conclusion.
35. The 17th green of the golf course where
the second impact occurred had a rising profile.
All three gears have dug into the ground causing
considerable decaaration of the aircraft as the
engine power was still at a low level at the
183

time ofothe impact. However the engines appear
to have continued accelerating to take off power
and sustained that power, till the impact with
the embankment. After a short distance, the
right engine cowling was riding on the surface
of a raised ground. This provided a support to
the aircraft on the right side with the left
main gear supporting the aircraft on the left'
or it is possible that the right main gear broke
at this point due to the high forces of the
second impact in the golf green and forces due
to gear digging into the ground. (The:: right
wheel marks had started before left indicating
that right gear hit the ground first, may be
due to slight right bank). This could be
the reason how the right wheel marks abruptly
ended when the right engine cowling marks commenced.
Also, because of the type of rising ground, the
nose wheels may have lifted off and later
the under surface of the fuselage sliding on
top of the embankment kept the nose gear clear of
the ground. Though there was a depression between
the 17th green and the embankment, the fast acce-
leration of the engines to take off thrust would
have contributed to a considerable pitch up
movement. This would have also assisted in
getting the nose up whereby the fuselage went
over the embankment instead of dipping down and
hitting it directly. This is based on the very
signif:! ant thrust change in the last 2 seconds
184

of the 8 seconds during acceleration from approach
idle to TOGA. (As indicated by the acceleration
charts of the V-2500 engines made available to the
Court).
The aircraft continued its forward movement
assisted by engine thrust. When the nose gear,
the engine nacelles followed by the main gears
impacted the embankment, they were all broken off
from the aircraft structure causing severe damage.
A noise similar to something breaking is there
in the CPR just before it stopped.
36. From the type of the imprints left by
the aircraft in this area, it is quite possible
that the aircraft has taken 2.4 seconds or even
a little more before the impact with the embankment
as indicated by the sounds recorded on the CVR
before it stopped.
37. The aircraft fuselage and the wings
chopped off a few small trees and eushes
top of the embankment during its passage. The
thudding referred to by one of the survivors is
considered to be the impact of the aircraft
structure against the embankment.
REGARDING THIRD IMPACT:
38. The fuselage with its damaged wings still
under
attached to the body, with its /carriage and
engines broken off, hopped over the nullah and
a road parallel to the embankment and impacted
185

the ground for the third and a final time at
approximately 260 feet on the other side of the
embankment. The aircraft skidded on its belly
for about 170 feet before coming to a final stop.
During the hop, the disintegrated portions and
various components of the aircraft lay scattered
all over the ground between the road and its final
resting place. The fbrward end of the aircraft
was approximately 150 feet short of the boundary
wall of the airport towards runway 09. The
aircraft cane to rest on its belly in an upright
condition.
The aircraft did not stall prior to the
third impact because of:
(1) The long skid marks for a distance of
170 feet caused by the belly of the aircraft before
it came to a stop as reported by the Inspector of
Acciderit.
( ea) Tb (cid:9) and half of the cockpit which
has survived the fire has shown the front sloping
portion below the right hand front wind shield
having a smooth surface as it would be on an
ai rcr aft.
(3) The post mortem reports of both pilots
showed that they died of burns and not due to
injuries sustained. Both the pilots had not
sustained any fractures. Items (2) and (3) indicate
',1Hes Pi i r(cid:9) •'1,:Ar (In(cid:9) e_bnrric, ttr.,.yr t•on
186

(4) The portion of thcg tail from the(cid:9) afrid
to the JPU exhaust does not show any signs of
damageleave alone serious crumpling of the structure
to indicate that the aircraft hit the ground on
its tail during the third impact.
(5) There were big stone boulders in the area
of the third impact over which the aircraft had
impacted which would have caused serious damage
to the bottom pai't of the fuselage, during the
170. feet skid of the aircraft.
39. Mr.Laxmiah Reddy of Hindustan Machine
Tools was witness No.22. From the evidence on
record, he is the only person who has seen the
actual progress of the aircraft from the embanliment
to the third impact point and final rest position.
His statement about how the engines fell is
corroborated by the position of the engines after
the crash. During croSs e—)Cam-i-rrat-i-on---by learned
Counsel, he stated that the cockpit was in normal
position and that the front portionwas not
separated from the other part of the plane when
he saw it. According to him, the plane landed
on the marshy land as if it was a normal landing.
He also deposed that there was an explosion in
the front portion of the plane almost immediately
after the aircraft came to rest.
40. We are of the view that the fuselage in
one piece with the winos attached came to rest
in an upright condition after the third impact.
There was an explOsion immediately thereafter along
I
t:h n mn.ior fire.(cid:9)

IV 2(cid:9) ( Mr. GO SWAMY' S VIEWS)
FIRST IMPLCT ON GOLF COURSEs
At DFDR second 319 CM1 asked CM2 whether
1.(cid:9)
he was still on the Auto Pilot. At 321 second
CN i(cid:9) replied in the negative and CM2 also confirmed
that Auto Pilots were off. At 322 second CM1
realised that the aircraft was sinking abnormally
and explained "Rey, we are going down". At
323 second "Sink rate" warning from ground proximity
warning system and Radio altimeter "one hundred"
feet call out came. Then CM2 was alarmed
realising that the matter was serious and said
"0, shift". Immediately CM1 called "Captain"
and at 32A second desperately repeated "Captain
still going",. It is implied that he lost all
hope and was appealing to CM2 to do something
to recover from the situation. At 325 second
second "sink rate" warning came indicating
that the rate of descent was
abnormally high.
At 326 second most probably CM2 disconnected
the auto thrust depressing the instinctive
push buttons on the thrust levers and moved
them to TOGA position, which was confirmed by
the "Chime" sound in the CVR and thrust lever
full forward position in DFDR, vide page 4 of
DFDR figure 10, But this action did not change
the situation materially because engine power
was already building up due to alpha floor
activation at 32430 second as indicated by gradual
increase of aircraft speed from 106.53 kt. at
188

323 second to 111.28 kt• at 326 second. At 327
second third "sink rate" warning and RA call out
voiced. At 328 second fourth and
"fifty" feet was
last "sink rate" warning and RA call out "Ten"
feet was sounded. By this time engine built up
some power as evidenced by actual EPR increase
and speed increase to 112.78 kt. vide DFDR parameters.
But power build up was not sufficient like any
other jet engine due to slow response to acceleration
from lower power. Finally, at 329.8 second the
aircraft impacted the ground on the golf course of
Karnataka Golf Association. Due to increased
downward momentum (inertia) of the aircraft like
ny other jet aircraft and due to slow response
to acceleration of the engine like any other
jet engine the sink rate could riot be arrested
since the height available was not sufficient and
the aircraft could not be recovered because action
initiated, in this case, triggering of alpha
floor was too late. Experiments carried out
by Airbus Industrie, International Aero Engines
and also by the Court indicated that if alpha
floor could have been activated 3 seconds earlier
i.e.
at DFDR second 320 or thrust lever moved to
TOGA position at that time, then only it was
possible ror the pilots to arrest the sink rate
and recover the aircraft.
It may be stated in this connection that
2.(cid:9)
during replay of CVR at NAL, Bangalore, in presence
189

of all participants it was confirmed that there
was a click sound between the words "going" and
"down" when CM1 said "Hey, we are going down". It
appeared that this click sound could be the
sound of the thurst levers moving to TOGA ( extreme
forward) position. But Airbus Industrie felt that
this was the sound for CM1 sidestick pull to
full backward position. DFDR data shows that
C}41 sidestick was moved to full back position
between 322 and 323 second alpha floor was triggered
at 323.1 and EPR command started increasing
from 324 to(cid:9) second. These parameters match
Airbus Industrie thinking. But if it is
considered that 1 second time is lost between
uttering "Hey, we are going.... " and the thrust
levers movement to TOGA position it can be
presumed that the thrust levers were moved to
TOGA at 323 second. But MA position (Throttle
lever position) parameter in DFDR figure 10
page 4 shows that it was moved to TOGA position
at 326 second.
3.(cid:9) As per Airbus Industrie letter No.AI/E-FS
420.0218/90 dated 25-9-1990 it appears that there
might be a time lag of maximum .4 second for
the DFDR% parameter to show the TLA position.
Therefore, it can be said that the actual TOGA
position movement could be at 325.6 second. If
we further consider 1.second time difference for
CV1- 1-DFDR co-relation still 1.6 second could not
be accounted for. However, if CVR_DFDR co-relation
made by Canadian Aviation Safety Board, vide
CASB document No.EP 36/90 dated 4.6.1990 is
accepted then "Hey, we are going down" was
190

spoken at 323 second. If it is further considered
that 1.5 second was lost in uttering the phrase
"Hey, we are going down" and if a margin of 1 second
time difference is allowed, for CVR-DFDR co-relation
then it can be said that the thrust levers were
moved to TOGA position at 325.5 second. If the
time lag of .4 second maximum is subtracted
fmm actual recorded time of DFDR TLA parameter
it indicates that the TLA was moved to TOGA
position at 326 - .4 = 325.6 second which
matches well with the thrust lever movement at
325.5 second as stated above. Therefore, as
per the second analysis, although the TL was
moved when CM1 said "Hey, we " it
actually reached TOGA position at 325.5 second.
It may also be construed that the thrust levers
were moved by CM2 to TOGA position while CM1
was saying "Hey, (cid:9) " and moving his sidestick
to full back position. Although the action was
delayed, this theory does not materially improve
the situation as the engine power was already
in the process of building Up since alpha floor
was already activated at 323.9 second. Thi s
theory only supports that CM1 acted as he said
"Hey, we (cid:9) But this theory does not
explain when and how sidestick was moved unless
it was presumed that both sidestick and thrust
levers were moved simultaneously while saying,
"Hey, (cid:9) " and that sidestick and throttle
movement sounds coincided. Also it does not
191

explain the chime coming at DFDR second 326 in
the CVR-.
HARD LANDING vs. SOFT TOUCH DOWN AT FIRST CONTACT
WITH GROUND
4.(cid:9) First touch down on the golf course left
a continuous print of MLG wheel tyre marks for
about 82 feet . At appropriate speed it was
calculated and established that the aircraft remained
in contact with the ground for about .42 second.
Then it bounced as indicated by discontinuity of
tyre marks for about 234 feet and touched the
Golf Course near 17th hole for the second time.
Time taken by the aircraft to reach this point
uorks out to about 1.5 second from first touch
down. Here first main wheel touched, then nose
wheel touched. Main wheel contact with the
ground was for 102 feet but nose wheel contact for
30 feet only. The soil was softer here and the
tyre marks were deep. After the second impact
the RH engine grazed a raised portion of the ground
for about 40 feet. The aircraft thereafter jumped
off the ground for a distance of about 43 feet
till it collided with the embankment. According
to Ir.',,Teaver of I.A.E, time between first
impact end hitting the embankment is more than
2 second . At ground speed 118 kt. i.e. 201 feet/second
time to cover the distance of about 475 feet works
to 2.3 second vide page 6 of his deposition.
The collision of the aircraft with the embankment
vary hard and it cause.' the ongines to drop down,
192

nose and main landing gear to shear off and front
bottom fuselage to be crushed near electric and
electronic compartment.
5. Regarding nature of impact at first touch
down there were two divergent views. Indian Airlies,
Indian Commercial Pilots Association and Air
Passengers Association, Madras felt the first touch
down was soft and cannot in any case cause a
6.125 g load. On the other hand Airbus Industrie -
I.A.E. felt it a very hard landing encountering
r (cid:9)
a normal acceleration of 6.125 g.
6. Parties in favour of soft landing quoted
two reasons:
1. Light tyre mark on the ground and
2. Passenger/airhostess statements.
Airbus Industrie and(cid:9) put up technical
justification to prove their point of view of
hard landing:
To decide whether a landing is soft or hard,
the following points have to be considered:-
1. Strength of the subsoil
2. Ground marks
3. Rate of descent or vertical speed
4. Normal acceleration
5. Passenger ,..ritness
6. Matching of DFDR parameters.
1S3

(1) Strength of the suhsoil:
Subsoil testing of the Golf Course near first
and second impact was carried out by an independent
Organisation and it has reported that the soil near
first impact was much harder than the soil near
second impact. Therefore, a hard landing would
rct- make a deep impressions at the first impact
point. Since the soil was softer, the second
impact point registered deep groove mark which
was not at all indicative of hard impact.
(2) Ground marks:
As stated above ground marks did not prove
that first impact was soft.
(3) Rate of descent or vertical speed:
irrom Ex.95 it is observed that the rate of
descent or vertical speed before first impact was in
excess of 20 feet/second and from GPWS sink rate
'warning it 'works out to 16 feet/second to 25 feet/sec-
ond. Therefore, it was definitely more than
16 feet/second. Capt.Guyot in page 9/10 of his
deposition stated that as per Airbus Industrie
design office t le design limit load of A-320
aircraft correnonds to a vertical velocity on
landing of 10 feet/second. Ultimate load s
1.5 x 10 = 15 :Feet/second. Therefore, vertical
velocity of 16 feet/second was in excess of
ultimate design load and so the first landing was
Be further stated that corresponding
194

to a normal acceleration of 6.125 g at the C.G.,
the g effect near cockpit was 13g and in the rear
part 17g. In page 73 of his deposition, he stated
that even if hard landing at first touch down did
not disintegrate the structure, it is considered
that some internal damage is possible such as
rupture of pipelines, disconnection of electrical
wire in joints, damage to components and cracks
in metal parts, etc.
To Verify Capt.GuyotI s statement "Aircraft
Structure" by PEERY which is a standard book on
aircraft structure was consulted. In page 52
it has been stated that if landing shock occurs
for a short interval of time, it may be less
injurious to the structure and less disagreeable
to the passengers than a sustained load would he.
This explains that even if the normal acceleration
exceeds the design load it is not necessary that
the structure will disintegrate. Nature of
distribution of load over the stru-cAtirP has to
be considered. In page 60 it has been shown in
the same book that in the tail portion of aircraft
the 'gi effect may be 10 even if the 'gl effect
the the C.G. is 3.5. This explains that e ven
normal acceleration at the C.G. of VT-EPN was
6.125 it is possible that in the'cockpit it could
be 13 or in the tail portion it could be 17.
195

4) Normal acceleration:
During normal flight envelope the 'gl effect
is around 1. Scrutiny of Normal acceleration data
of DFDR during last 5 minutes reveal(cid:9) that it was
so. In their first letter dated 23-2-1990 to
Mr.Khola, Deputy Director General of Civil Aviation,
Canadian Aviation Safety Board informed for the
mil L Lime that normal acceleration signal had
experienced expansion and compression distortion
Ler approximate 3/4th of the way through the
q di storti on was due to,
eePOr"1(cid:9) Tat
they considered, as a result of vibrations
ncluceil by the aircraft impact with terrain.
Therefore, it is clear that the first impact
on the golf course was at the end of subfraine
329 and the impact was heavy. CASB subsequently
recovered this distorted signal through analysis
of the DFDR wave form. Additionally, a portion
of a second after reference time 331 was also
recovered. Airbus Industrie, vide letter
1-9--7-1.90
No. LI/ (cid:9) 1,1\r/IG 44.7 0608/90 dated
intimated that according to their calculation at
first touch down impact at the Math Landing Gears

the Airbus Industrie calculated
196

The value of normal acceleration recorded in last
two readings of 329 second and first two readings
of 330 second are 2.781, 6.12, 3.01 and 1.57
These readings recorded by the accelerometer seem
to be perfectly in order, since it has gradually
increased to a peak value of 6.125 and then
reduced gradually.
(5) Passenger witness:
Two airhostesses in the rear and two out
of three passenger witnesses stated that the
landing was normal but one witness Mr.Kumar Nadig
who was also a pilot (Private Pilot Licence Holder)
and who regularly flies once or twice in a month
stated in his deposition that it was quite a
hard touch down, too quick and unusually hard
impact. Therefore, passengers opinions are
at variance on the issue. Considering the valued
opinion expressed by the author PEERY of
Aircraft Structure' in page 52 that if the
landing shock occurs for a short interval of
time, it may not be felt by the nassengers, it
may be stated that passengers witness did not
project the correct picture.
(6) Matching of DFDR parameters:
CASB in the introduction to their document
No.EP/36/90 dated 4.6.1990 stated in page 3 para 3.3
"The DFDR and the CVR was aligned such that the
197

crash sound on the CVR occurred at reference time
329.8, the time at which an impact occurred on the
DFDR ad evidenced by the normal acceleration and
the distortion of the DFDR wave form signal. This
time matched well with the VHF keying and the
radio altitude calls by the aircraft". It has
also been stated that "the DFUR data, the distorted
wave form signal in subframe 329 and the single
crash sound on the CVR indicated that only the
first impact was recorded and not the second.
The recording continued for about one and one
half second and then ended, on both recorders,
without recording a second impact". This further
proves that the first impact was at 329.8 second
and it was a heavy impact. It also proved that
second impact was not recorded. Additionally)
it must be clearly understood that the severity
of impact on second touch down following a bounce
after first touch down can never be more than
that on the first touch down because most of the
vertical velocity will be lost after first touch
down.
Further, Inspector of Accident during his
cross examination clarified in page 34 that
"now with the final DFDR data it appears that the
been
6g has occurred at a place which had/described
as a soft touch down". "The impact occurred during
last 'quarter of the seconds of subframe 329 of DFDR".
In this connection comments of CASB, in
their reply No.142-1 dpted 2-10-1993 addressed
is very pertinent. It says
to the Court
198

"As for vertical acceleration which was specifically,
queried, it appears to follow a believable trend
and I think that it is therefore most probably
valid, including the value of 6.125 g during the
end of subframe 329".
7.(cid:9) Further, a site inspection of the initial
touch down area in the golf course within a few
days of the date of accident did not reveal much
undulations. The surface appeared to be fairly
even except for a couple of shallow depressions
without sharp edges at the periphery. This
was also confirmed by the continuous tyre marks.
By any stretch of imagination normal acceleration
cannot reach more than 6 g value as, a result of
flexible and large diameter tyre rolling over
such a profile of terrain.
Realiability of DFDR data after first impact :
8.(cid:9) Airbus Industrie in their letter No.AI/E-fs
420.0 10 3/90 dated 4-5-1990 in the last sentence
in page 3 first intimated DGCA that "we think that
any data retrieved after the first impact cannot
be considered as reliable" since the impact with
more than 6 g load was well out of any design
objective. CASB, in their final report No.EP 36/90
dated 4-6--1990, while giving their assessment
of DFDR data stated " the normal acceleration
data after subframe 329 suggested that the
aircraft was in a bounce,
after the first impact,
when the recording stopped• The first impact
was therefore, considered sufficient to have
199

caused internal damage to the aircraft which
affected the operation of both recorders. After
subframe 329, the sidestick pitch controllers for
both crew went to exactly the same number (-9.51°).
It would be highly coincidental that both sidesticks
were moved to the same value. It is considered
more likely that the aircraft was "broken" in
some manner which caused the system to malfunction".
Therefore, malfunction of DFDR recording system
including wiring used to carry signals from
pickup points (transmitters) of some of the
components and systems cannot be ruled out. Under
such circumstances some parameters recorded by
the DFDR cannot give the true picture or status
after init1.a1 impact which exceeded 6 g value.
Capt.Guyot and Capt.Gordon Corps of Airbus
Industrie and Mr.Weaver, Mr.13olt and Mr..S under
Venkat of I.A.E. had in their depositions rightly
stressed this point. Thus, it is seen that
after 329.8 DFDR second when the first impact
occurred encountering more than 6g, the following
parameters misrepresented the actual values:
(1) Parameter SSPPC and SSPPFO representing
both sidestick movements in figure 4
of DFDR parameter listing, showing the
sane value -9.51° which is highly
coincidental and hence improbable.
(2) The engine parameters such as EPR
actual which was steadily increasing
from DFDR second 324 suddenly camp
200

down at DFDR second 331 whicn were
incon si stent.
( 3) Engine 1 EGT came down at 331 second
although fuel flow increased substantially.
(4) With correctly operating ELAC-1 transmitting
same signal to both elevators, their
movements because erratic at 330 second-LH
elevator movement _8.89 and RH elevator
-17.70 which 1,3 absurd.
(5) DFDR normal acceleration parameter did
not show any significant g value for the
second impact; in fact, after mid 330 second
it recorded less than .7 g only.
(6) Hitting the embankment with severe impact
did not show any appreciable longitudinal
acceleration value.
9.(cid:9) With regard to reliability of DFDR data
after first touch down the CASB, in their reply
No.142-1 dated 2-10-1990 addressed to the Court
stated "The data which follows trends should
generally be considered valid, right through to
'the end of recording". Most of the data, in
fact, appears to follow trends (it is not way off).
While the data may be considered valid, it is
important to realise that, after the impact during
subfrcne 329, the source ( signal from the transducer
or electronic buzes) of the data may no longer
be representing reality, even though the DFDR
appears to record a valid word. Asit s likely
impossible to determine absolutely, one can only
judge the data by the trends it is following and
201

try to assess it as it relates to accident.
10. Therefore, DFDR parameters after first
impact have to be considered with proper judgment
and technical reasoning. Only those parameters
which are found consistent and following the same
trend belbre and after the impact ;:iould he
considered acceptable.

11. Scrutiny of snag sheets of VT-EPN since
its introduction into service did not reveal
any significant, major or repetitive defect on
the engines. Before take-off from Bombay on
I0-605 on 14-2-1990 also there were no engine
defects reported either by the pilot or the
engineer. During flight no defect on the engine
operation, performance or failure to respond to
the pilots input were reported as evidenced by
absence of any such communication from the
aircraft to ATC as required by I.A. Operations
Manual Chapter I page 1.20 para 1.3.4.2 item 3.
From the time alpha floor was activated
at 323.9 all relevant engine parameters viz,
EPR command, fuel flow, EGT, EPR actual and N2
responded properly and increased as recorded
in the DFDR (reference to figure 11 and figure
12 of DFDR parameter listing may please be made).
A close agreement between engine simulation
and DFDR data in respect of the above parameters
202

demonstrated that the engines behaved normally
during acceleration from 323.9 second prior to
the first impact at 329.8 second L Please refer
7.
to Annexures ( 1) 7 2) 7 (3) and (4)
(
In respect of EPR actual it has been observed
12.(cid:9)
that 5 readings recorded in the DFDR befbre the
first impact, when plotted in the acceleration
simulation curve, matched well, rather, found
better than expected. There was an abrupt
deviation from the expected values after the
first impact at 329.8 second. Values at 330
and 331 seconds were found inconsistent with the
previous trend of the actual curve for which
there cannot be any technical reasons other
than unrealiability of the DFDR EPR actual data
after first iinpact with more than 6 g loading
which has already been discussed earlier in detail.
Even if it is presumed that the engines
started malfunctioning for some reasons or the
other, it is highly improbable that same type
of defect will occur in both engines at the same
time to give same type of poor performance i.e.
failure to accelerate at the same time as per schedule.
Flinctional test of EECs at the Makers'
facility revealed that the channels that were in
control of the engines were functioning properly
and test of fault memory dump showed that there
were no fault that would have affected normal
engine operation. In this connection deposition
203

of Mr.Polt of I.A.E. in page 7 and also strip
investigation and functional test report of EEC
may please be referred to.
13. Physical inspection in the crash site,
boroscopic inspection and strip investigation of
the engines revealed more or less same type of
damage. Bent and broken fan and compressor blades
in the opposite direction of rotation, metalisation
in the burner and shearing of low pressure rotor
stub shaft due to high torsion indicated that
both the engines were operating at or near take
off power before they were dropped after hard
impact with the embankment. In this connection
engine on-site and strip inspection report may
please be seen
14. Mr.Weaver of I.A.E. in his deposition
stated in page 11 that based on the design criteria
of the engines the calculated value of the torsional
load required to shear the LPC stub shaft structure
at full power is minimum 710,000 in lb. To cross
check this statement the pertinent calculation
sheet was asked for by the Court which was duly
forwarded. It showed that the ultimate torque
was 719,000 in lb. With the data provided the
ultimate torque to shear the stub shaft
was recalculated as shown in the text book
named "strength of Materials" by Timoshenko
published by Van No strand. The recalculation
worked out to 719,396 in lb. which matched
with figure forwarded by I.A.E.
204

15.(cid:9) Summarising the above it is stated that:
(1) There was no defect in the engines which
operated satisfactorily.
(2) Engine parameters recorded by DFDR prior
to the first impact at 329.8 second were
absolutely normal commensurate with the
expected performance.
(3) Relevant DFDR parameter figures concerning
engine response to acceleration when
plotted against the simulated nominal
graph did not show any abnormality EPR
actual value, in particular,,, was little
better than expected.
(4) Both engines failing to accelerate at the
same time duo to any mechanical failure
is highly illogical.
(5) Functional test of EEC did not reveal
any defect or malfunctioning.
(6) Physical inspection, baroscopic inspection
and strip inspection of the engines
revealed that they were operating at or
near full power when they dropped off
the wings.
(7) Nature of damage to the LPC stub shaft
of both engines indicated that ultimate
design torsional force must have been
applied to sheer off the shaft which is
possible only if the engines were
operating at full power.

From the above it is concluded that the
engines responded properly to the acceleration
schedule as per specification and were producing
almost full power before hitting the embankment.
Second, third and fourth impact:
16.(cid:9) Although many witnesses have stated that
the aircraft experienced three impacts, from
ground marks. it is 'established that the aircraft
actually impacted four times
( 1) First impact on the golf course with
6.125 g .
Second impact after bounce near 17th
hole on softer ground.
Third impact with the embankment which
was very hard and
Fourth impact on the belly on the
marshy area which was on the other
side of the embankment, nullah and road
finally coming to a halt.
In this connection, Capt.Guyot said in his
deposition in page 11 "our estimation is that the
time lapse between the first touch down and
the point where the aircraft finally stopped is
about 4 to 5 seconds. The aircraft during this 4 to
5 seconds was experiencing 3 very severe impacts
before the final one"•. By simple calculation with
the help of ground speed, the distance and time
difference between first and second impact were
found to be 316 feet and 1.5 second. respectively.
206

Distance and time difference between second and
third impact were 169 feet and .84 second approximate.
Both CVR and DFDR stopped functioning just before
second impact. Capt.Guyot in page 11 of his
deposition said "In this crash both CVR and DFDR
go off at about the time of second touch down".
He also said in page 39 of his deposition,
"
on my knowledge the DFDR stops at 1.6 second
after first touch down which corresponding roughly
to be second touch down". CASB also confirmed
this view in their report No.EP 36/90 dated 4.6.1990.
It stated that the analysis of the DFDR data
and the single crash sound on the CVR indicated
that only the first impact was recorded and not
the second. The recording continued for one
and half second and then ended, on both recorders,
without recording a second impact. The normal
acceleration data after subframe 329 suggested
that the aircraft was in a bounce after the
first impact when the recording stopped. The 25

17. After the second impact the aircraft hit
the embankment very severely dropping both engines,
breaking nose and main landing gears and crushing
front bottom fuselage containing electric and
electronic bay. It is most likely that the fire
was initiated at this stage due to some short
circuit in the electrical net work in the electric
and electronic bay. In this condition the aircraft
hopped over the embapkment, nullah and the road
and grazed on the belly over the marshy area
before coming to a final rest. There were cracks
on the front spar of the RH wing which allowed
fuel from RH tank to rush forward due to inertia.
This fuel mainly supported the fire. There
was
extensive fire damage in the front fuselage
area ahead of the wings and practically the whole
of the fuselage with other structure were consumed
by fire.
Co-relation of DFDR and CVR
18. Digital Flight Data Recorder (DFDR) records
VHF keying parameters showing VHF transmissions
by the aircraft. When the aircraft transmits this
parameter is recorded on the D.FDR. The actual
transmission is simultaneously recorded on the
cockpit voice recorder. DFDR records a time
signal which is not available on the CVR. DFDR-CVR
=2o-relation requires expertise. The normal
practice is to have a copy of CVR tape was prepared
with a time signal, recorded on one of the channels.
This recorded time will be simultaneously displayed
208

during the replay for transcription. Timings
of the VHF transmissions recorded on CVR were
matched with the timings recorded op the DFDR VHF
keying to obtain the co-relation. Thc-'- 4.
absolutely no material to doubt that this method
was not adopted either by the DGCA or by the
CASH assisted by the American experts (NTSB). It
was noticed during co-relation that the speed
of the CVR replay was about two percent higher
than the DFDR recordings and CVR timings were
accordingly corrected.
19. Actual co-relation of CVR and DFDR timings
achieved by synchronising the VHF No,1 keying
parameter with the transmissions to the ATC
showed that the transmissions by the aliceic,_,
fell within one second of the VHF keyings except
one trensmissfon which was synchroni .9ed by about
two seconds. Sampling rate of the DFDR for
the VHF keying parameter is once, every ;,con
The co-relation achieved between the DFDR
CVR, therefore, has an accuracy of about one
second. This co-relation by the Inspector of
Accident is within one second of the CASB' s
co-relation except for a couple of readings.
20. CASB in their report No.EP 36/90 dated
4-6-1990 stated in para 3.2 and 3.3 in page 3:
" The CVR cape provided by the Indian
Government on Tuesday, April 17, ic.y.;.0
played back at the tTAIST3 "*,,z oratory at its
209

standard speed arid it was determined that the
400 hertz aircraft power was displaying as
384 hertz. The CVR was therefore played back
4% faster and a copy tape was made while a
simultaneous real time code was written to the
copy tape. The time code, co-related to DFDR
reference time, is shown on the partial CVR
transcript provided in Appexdix
21.(cid:9) The DFDR and the CVR were aligned such
that the crash sound on the CVR occurred at
reference time 329.8, the time at which an
impact "occurred on the DFDR as evidenced by
the normal acceleration and the distrotion of
the DFDR wavefbrm signal. This time matched
well with the VHF keying and the radio altitude
calls by the aircraft".

There has been a controversy as to the
nature of the first touch down and whether
'G' force at that time was 6.125, or whether
the said 'G' force is the result of the second
impact at the 17th green of the Golf Course
or whether the recording of 6.125 in the DFDR
was incorrect.
(2) The rival view points are projected
in the words of the respective Assessors;
(3) Mr. Goswamy prefers to hold that the
6.125 'G' force is attributable to the first
touch down, while Capt. Rao and Capt. Copal
opine that the said 'G' force recorded by the
DFDR cannot be referable to any of the touch
downs and it is not a correct recording. Diver-
gent views are also expressed regarding the co-
relation of CVR-DFDR timings.
(4) I am of the view, whether the co-
relation of timing is to be as furnished by
CASB or as noted by the two Assessors, does
not affect the ultimate conclusion, for the
simple reason, that the timing as to the
activation of Alnha floor and the movement
of the thrust levers were within q seconds
of the crash from whatever angle the timings
are computed. The movement of the thrust
levers at this noint of time (whether at
211

324.05 seconds or thereafter at 326.seconds)
would not have changed the course of the plane
towards the crash. I em of the view that the
controversy need not be technically resolved
here, for the determination of the basic cause
for this crash.
(5) There has been unanimity about the
performance of the-engines; the ultimate
conclUsion is that engines behaved. satisfa-
ctorily. DFDR shows that throttle lever
was(cid:9) at Toga position at .326 seconds (as 45°).
When performance of engines has been found
normal by other process of investigation, EPR
values at TF.330 loose: significance. A
definite answer regarding the timing of 6.125
'G' ih no way substantially aids the investiga-
tion. It may be an interesting subject for
examination by the Scientists and technologists.
No other significance of the timing of
6.125 'G' was pointed out during the course
of the enquiry, nor in the arguments.
(6) No expert was examined by anyone to
,aFtnblish that the plane's first or the second
resulted in 6.125 'G'; only certain
estiong were made to the witnesses, without
elicl_ting technical data for Investigation.
(7) However, it is necessary to make some
observations:
(i) The triggering of Alnha floor is stated
212

to be at 323.1 seconds; at the earliest its
activation will be at 323.9 though one cannot
be too sure of this time of activation; it
might have been at 324.3 seconds also (consider-
ing a delay of 1.2 seconds for activation); if
so, by TF.329.9, it will be 5.6 seconds from
the time of activation of Alpha floor. The EPR
value should be slightly more than 1.05. If,
only movement of throttle levers is considered,
then between TF.326 to 329.9, the available time
was 3.9 seconds. EPR actual at TF.329 seconds
for envine-1 is 1.05 and for engine-2 it is
1.06; at TF.330 it is recorded as 1.07 and
1.07 respectively. These figures Rubstantially
satisfy the acceleration curve (Ex.105), wherein
it is indicated that at 5.5 seconds, EPR ought
to be 1.05 and at 6 seconds 1.08.
(ii)I n the written arguments submitted by
Indian Airlines, the time taken to estimate the
EPR value at 6 seconds is taken with effect
from 323 seconds; this is clearly an erroneous
basis. The Alpha floor triggering, at the
earliest, will be 323.9 seconds (and I think
it may perhaps be at 324.3 seconds or even
later, in view of the uncertain knowledge as
to this delay, exhibited by Airbus Industrie).
Therefore, at 329th time frame, engine had not
6 seconds to develop acceleration.
(iii)A momentary impact of 0.42 seconds
may not be injurious to the structure and that
213

possibility cannot be ruled out in this case,
especially when the plane was new and had not
experienced metallic fatigue.
(iv) The passengers and air-hostesses did
not feel the first touch down and this may,
support the theory that the first impact was
mild and normal. On the other hand it is
said that the first impact on the ground was
only for 0042 seconds, a momentary action
and therefore these witnesses did not feel the
experience so as to retain the experience in
their memory; and that these witnesses have
missed one of the touch downs, and have mixed
up two impacts as one, which shows that their
statements regarding the experience of the
touch downs is faulty; they stated that there
were only three touch downs in all. It is
also. said that if at the time of first touch
down the plane was in the take off stage, the
plane would not have again landed immediately
within such a short time, with a heavy force;
further, the EPR actual was only 1.05 for
engine-1 and 1.06 for engine-2 at TF.329 and
therefore engines had no sufficient power and
.speed to take off at the moment of the first
touch down.
(v) Capt. Thergaonkar said in his deposition
in page-14 in the last sentence that during
normal landing normally 1.25 'G' normal
214

acceleration is obtained. Therefore, if it is
presumed that the first touch down was a normal
landing, 1.25 '0' would have been recorded at-
least twice, since the aircraft was in contact
with the ground for 0.42 seconds; normal accele-
ration is recorded every 1/8th seconds in the
DFDR. Thus, if second touch down was hard and
experienced 6.125 'G',then 1 to 1.5 seconds
earlier than this recording,1.25 'G' would have
been recorded atleast twice. But,perusal of
'G' recording revealed that there was no such
recording; it was 1.06 or 1.07 Which is normal
When the aircraft was in air.
(vi) In the reasoning of Cant. Rao and
Cant. Gonal, minute discussion is found as to
Why 6.125 tG1 recording is unacceptable.
(8) Weighty reasons are found in the two
sets of rival views.
(9) The touch downs are Hart of the crash.
the
The cause for /crash develoued earlier to the
touch downs. In fact, the cause for the crash
developed somewhere between DFDR seconds 294
to 321. Therefore, an exact finding on this
controversial question of 6.125(cid:9) by itself
cannot give any clue to find out the cause
for the crash.
(10) It was anointed out that the first
touch down was a sqft one as spoken. to by the
215

passengers and the two air-hostesses; no damage
resulted to the plane by the first touch down
and by its own force, the plane moved forward
climbing up after the first touch down; the
plane must have gone up to about 14 to 20 feet,
cutting a few trees just before it hit the
ground severely near the 17th green of the Golf
Course; the 6.125- 'G' force was never there
either at the first impact or at the time of
second impact. This is so because, the plane
had 'skip bounced' at the first imnact. The
relevancy of this question relating to 6.125 'G'
force is stated to apply the DFDR readings
after 329.3 seconds (i.e., after the first
touch down, which was a soft impact); the idea
conveyed was that 6.125 recorded by DFDR was
spurious or incorrect and that any data giver
by the DFDR should not be accepted without
being corroborated by other sustaining evidence.
Arguments were addressed (in the written sub-
missions) about the reliability of DFDR data
after the first impact, but not of any earlier
recordings. No DFDR recordings for the neriod
295 saponds to 329.3 seconds were challenged
specifically.in the Court. Airbus Industrie
has sent an explanation dated 19th Sentember,
1990 (after the arguments were over) as to why
the DFDR recording for the initial 52 seconds
showing auto thrust speed select mode as engaged,
when the aircraft ,as still on the runway. Tne
216

auto thrust logic, is stated to be in and
remains in speed as long as the throttles are
not pushed for take-off power selection. The
doubt about the DFDR recording for the first
52 seconds was raised by one of the Assessors
only for the first time at the time of question-
ing Capt. Corps and the witness had to get the
answer only from Toulouse. In fact, Cart. Gonal
has not persued his line of thinking after
receipt of this letter as to the validity of
DFDR recording during the initial 52 seconds
before take-off at Bombay.
(11) The evidence on record explaining the
nature of the 'G' force and the basis to infer
the impact which resulted in 6.125 'G' is too
sketchy; the principles applicable have not
been placed before the Court by any of the
witnesses. As Indian Airlines also has exnressed
doubt about this recording, a further research
on this question may be conducted by the DGCA
and the Indian Airlines, in the light of rival
reasons found in th-e-v_iewgexpressed by the
Assessors.
(12) ICPA contended that the reading for the
last quarter of time frame 329 never came out
tn the normal manner even at the CASB; that
CASB did not recover some circuits as disclosed
from the letter of CASB; this last sub-frame was
short of 6 bits. Admittedly the signal for
217

this time frame had experienced expansion com-
pression and distortion after approximately three
quarter$ of the way through the sub frame;
this was assumed to, be as a result of vibration
and recording of 6.125 IG1 had been therefore
inferred, having been recorded after approximately
3 quarter of the way from sub-frame 329. In
these circumstances, ICPA contended that record-
ing of 6.125 'G' cannot be relied upon as the
correct '0' force exerted at that time frame,
having regard to the fact that this accelera-
tion is the 60th word of the second (T1.329)
SS
out of 64 words, and/there were distortions
at this point of time, this value of 6.125 'G'
cannot be relied upon, for this time frame. ICPA
also points out that CASB had revised the data
subsequently, but not considered by the Inspe-
ctor of Accident (Ex.115 is the letter of CASB
dated 23-2-1990 written to the MCA; the
revised data and the relevant letter of CASE
1bit). Indian Airlines
has referred to this controversy also to
question the accuracy of the recordings by
DrIci after the first impact and from this the
EPR values recorded after TF.329.8 was questioned.
At the same time, the Indian Airlines contended
that if DFD readings upto the plane's impact
with the embankment (i.e., third impact) were
to be accepted, EPR values shown are only 1.06
for engine-1 and 1.z11 for engine-2 at TF.331;
these show how poor and inadequate was the(cid:9) N(
218(cid:9)
k//11/1

engine response in the engine acceleration in
the last crucial seconds. The trend in the
written submissions of the Indian Airlines casts
doubt on the engine's performance, a very
serious matter for the operator of the aircraft
to make. During the investigation, its witnesses
did not speak anything against the power-build
up capacity of the engines; no expert was exa-
mined by the Indian Airlines to help the Court
to understand this problem of 'G' force.
(13) Indian Airlines, as the operator of
this aircraft, should have aided this investiga-
tion by examining some experts on this qu,;stion
rather than being satisfied by placing evidence
to sustain its case that the aircraft was properly.
maintained and the pilots were properly trained.
However, its learned counsel Placed a very ena-
lytipal and unbiased submissions, which has been
quite useful to me to appreciate the various
facets of the Problems involved in this investi-
gation.
(14) Capt. Gupta in his evidence has explained
the nature of 'G' force thus:
"At the time of normal landing
the 'G' force could be anywhere to
an extent of 1.0 to 1.05 value. At
1.5 'G' cannot be called a hard land-
ing. I cannot say what could be the
value on a hard landing. While
anproaching, the 'G' value in normal
219

circumstances should not be more
than 1.5. Any time when 1G1 value
is more than 1.5 does not necessa-
rily indicate that the aircraft is
on the ground. The load factors on
the aircraft at the time manoeuvring
have direct relation to the 'G' values.
The load factors are referred in
terms of the pressure, the lift, the
surface and the weight of the air-
craft. The pressure means the air
pressure. It is difficult to explain
16 colic:opt of Lift in simple terms.
The concept of surface does not mean
that it is on land, it will only
conclude the surface area of the
aircraft. So far in my experience
I have not exceeded the 'G' limits
during any of the approaches on
A.320 aircraft, The-va-rdis of IGI
force is only reflected in the air-
craft if it exceeds out of the limits
of 0.7 to 1.25. There will not be
any indication of the 1GI force when
it is between 0.7 and 1.25. This is
reflected on the Scam and where time
is reflected will disappears and till
value will anpear in amber. I reneat
any 'G' force indication or value can
never indicate whether the aircraft is
220

in the air or on ground under all
possible circumstances."
Cant. Guyot (witness for. Airbus Industrie)
has given his concept of this force:
"According to me the soft land-
ing is landing with a vertical
velocity I would say between 2 and
4 ft. per second. I have a record
of the soft landing of the VT-EPN
aircraft, which was recorded on the
DFDR, dUring its flight No.6 prior
to the accident. It is marked, as
Ex.94, Where the normal acceleration
was a maximum value of 1.10938
At the time of accident the vertical
speed was atleast 16 ft. per second
is revealed by the DFDR and the
derivation is explained in the docu-
ment now produced by me (Ex.95).
Taking in account the pressure alti-
tude evolution between time 324 to
329 we find an average vertical speed,
which is in excess of 20 ft. Der
second and what is said in this docu-
ment is that the value corresponding
to time 329 cannot be taken into
account because the pressure altitude
is recorded in sub-frame 64 which
md of the second 329
means et thei '
hj(
221

when the aircraft has already
touch down. I experienced twice
heavy landing earlier during my test
flights. The second one I experien-
ced was during A.320 flight testing.
During this secondflight testing the
relationship between vertical speed
and 'G' was 9 ft. per second related
to 3.6 IGt. The CVR also indepen-
dentlyindicates the high rate of
descent at the time of touch down
vide: CVR page 17, 2 seconds prior
to the crash there is the first sink
rate warning, again on the next
page there was further sink rate
warning and in the note Ex.95 this
is explained; the sink rate warning
activation conditions are attached
to the note Ex-95 are showing that
very close to the ground, the verti-
cal sneed conditions were unto
between 1000 and 1500 ft. per minute."
Again, he said:
HI think that the first touch down
was between time 329.7 and 329.8.
It is correct that the first impact
was at 6.125 'G' force.
(cid:9)
Refer to DFDR flight parameters
Rs
it is not correct that at 329.8
seconds the impact was 2.7q IG' ?
222
N-)'\111

Thefirst impact is immediately
A:(cid:9)
before the time corresponding to
2.78125 'GI that means correspond-
ing to time 329.75 or 329.8.
Qs(cid:9) Explain why 3.01563 has annesred
at 330?
A:(cid:9) After the peak of vertical
acceleration which could have
exceeded 6.125 'G' the vertical
acceleration is decreasing as the
aircraft is starting to bounce.
Qs(cid:9) The initial touch down of
6.125 'G' was in excess of the design
limit of the aircraft ?
As(cid:9) Yes. As I already stated.
(cid:9) At such an impact even if it

integ-rating, it is nossible that
internal damage such as. runture of
pipeline, disconnection of electri-
cal wire in joints, damage to
components and cracks in metal
parts might have taken niece ?
As Yes.
Q: What made the plane to roll for
about 80 feet after the first impact
instead of bouncing ?
A:(cid:9) It was rolling for about .4
seconds that means les's than half a
second whichl means that the bouncing
223

was quite immediate."
Then, further, he was questioned about the
possibility of first touch down being a
soft one. The relevant questions and
answers were:
Qs You have indicated that this
aircraft would have atleast 16 ft.
per second vertical velocity to
record 6..125 'G' ?
A:(cid:9) Yes.
Q:(cid:9) This would be very close to a
rate of descent of 1000 ft. per
minute at the time of first touch
down, Will this statement is
correct
A:(cid:9) Yes.
Q:(cid:9) As explained earlier if the-re
is a sudden rise of the ground of
only 3 inches in a distance of
4* ft. you can get a value of
6.125 'G' recorded on the DFDR.
Could this not have happened in
this touch down. Did you consider
these factors, when you confirm that
the 'G' values were correct ?
As(cid:9) We considered this factor but
we did not think that the undulation
of the ground was such that as the
one you are indicating.
Qs(cid:9) Coining sack to Ex.94 you. have
stated that
a rough run way surface
224

would give you increased 'G' values.
Could not a definite fairly deep
undulation as indicated in this
photograph 46(5) caused a very
high increase in the 'G' value 7
A:(cid:9) The. only way to know how deep
is that kind of'depression is to
have had after the crash a very
measurement by specialist
accurate
People of title topographic measures
of the ground in the Golf Course.
it is provident that the
Anyway,
aeroplane had a very high vertical
speed at the touch down which is
consistent with the previous values
of a hard landing which was recorded
in Toulouse.
Q:(cid:9) Do you mean to say that the
expert team from Airbus Industrie
which visited the crash site- did
not take this into cognizance
before coming to a conclusion ?
A:(cid:9) I do not say so.
Q:(cid:9) Please refer to fig. 4 page
28. Please look at the elevator's
position commencing from the right
elevator et time frame 328 till the
right elevator at time frame 330.
Both .side sticks were held fully
back, which was the maximum the
225

the pilot could do under the si-
tuation. I wish to suggest to you
that this elevator movement hps
been absolutely correct has had
proper effect and hag arrested the
rate of sink just before the touch
down and the aircraft would have
touched down at a very low rate of
sink 14ith the 'G' increase is re-
corded only due to the severe undu-
lation of the ground. This has been
confirmed by the surviving experi-
enced air hostesses and some
passengers.
A:(cid:9) I do not agree with that.
Q:(cid:9) I would also like to suggest
that any rotation of the aircraft
will induce a positive 'G' and that
is what has caused this aircraft
to go up into the air again, after
the first touch down and because of
lack of speed and in addition the
landing mode the aircraft hit the
ground again hard just prior to the
imnact to the embankment ?
A:(cid:9) I do not agree with that. The
aircraft due to the touch down at a
high vertical speed, had probably
very strong pitch down movements at
226

the time of the touch down and its
very low speed he had at this time,
he was unable to comnensate the pitch
movements by a normal rotation and
the aircraft was bouncing."
Here during the course of recording
the evidence, for the first time on 26th
July 1990 I find d suggestion by one of the
Assessors in his questions, the reasons for
his opinion that the first touch down was a
soft one. Capt. Gopal digclosed his doubts
and it was for the Airbus Industrie to clear
not
it. A mere assertion by a witness is
proving any technological fact.
This *witness was further questioned
(15)(cid:9)
by reference to photographs of the crash
site.by pointing out that from ground markings,
it has to be inferred that landing gears
did not suffer any distortion. Throughout
the investigation I understood this contro-
versy about 6.125 1G' forde as relevant
only to find out the accelerating characteri-
the engines; its relevancy otherwise
stics of
was not known to me. If it has a bearing
on any other questionand has a significance in
considering any other possibility, then I am of the
view, it is too late to consider such a
possibility.
227

CVE(DFDR CO-RELATION,
(10(cid:9) The she4t5
deplting the gnalie
tint-
lysis
of the click sound preP6red at NAL'were
placed as part of court records. On 1st
August, 1990 a letter
was issued to all the
participants in this connection.' This analysis
was through ultra-violet (U0V) recording. I
expected, atleast, Airbus Industtie to take un
the clues and get ,the sound
analysed scienti-
fically so that the Court would be provided
with another opinion for comparison. Airbus
Industrie have taken a negative attitude on
this question, for reasons best known to them.
No independent attempt was made by Airbus
Industrie to have this sound analysed scienti-
fically.The mode and manner' of analysis done
at NAL was made known to all by placing the
papers as part of Court records. This analysis
is relevant, mainly to identify the click sound.
(17)(cid:9) In case the thrust lever movement
caused the sound, recorded in between
the words
"Hey we are going down", the timing given to
the said expression by CASB will have to be
slightly shifted by a second, but that in no way
materially affects the ultimate conclusion, as
is clear from the two rival sets of reasonings.
(18)(cid:9) According to the revised co-relation
shown in the opinion of M/s. Capt. Rao and Cant.
Gopall CM.1
asked For "700 feet rate of descent"
between 292 to 293.5 seconds. If CM.2 had
228
,11\1111\1

actually attempted to set the speed of 700 feet
rate of descent, immediately thereafter, the
timing of such selection will be 294 seconds,
at a time, when the plane was in Alt* phase.
In case CM.2 had not noticed the Alt* phase,
or failed to follow the procedure arorlicable
to the Alt* phase, his- selection of 700 feet
of descent rate would be a futile exercise.
To this extent the revised co-relation made
by the two Assessors has some bearing on the
situation to be found out by the Court -during
the first phase of the crucial seconds. Simi-
larly it has relevancy in the context of identi-
fying the exact timing of the crash sounds.
(19)(cid:9) Th.e revised timings made by the two
Assessors were not before the Court et the
time of the actual enquiry and the arguments;
the mode adopted to dissect the timings and co-
relate them could not be tested by the pnrti-
cinsnts. Such an examination is possible only
if the participants knew of it and had onportu-
nity to challenge it. Therefore, I am of the
opinion that this co-relation of the timings
made by the two learned Assessors cannot be the
sole basis for any decision by me.
229

PART IV
CHAPTER - 3
THE CRUCIAL SECONDS AND THE CRASH
1.(cid:9) Some of the controversial events are found
after 292 DFDR seconds and it can safely be said
that the problem of finding out the cause for the
crash commences at or aboUt the time CM1 said
"O.K. 700 rate of depcent". It is after this
time the plane seems to have gone into idle open
descent mode, which was noticed by C112 at about
305 seconds. What made the plane to go into this
mode? Why spped mode was not selected or
attained; when and how did the pilots react and
resorted to remedial action? are some of the
questions to be answered. Here again, one
view referred below as AI is preferred by
Capt.C.R.S. Rao and Capt. B.S.Gopal and
the other point of view 'B' is preferred by
Sri.S.G.Goswami. Their respective reasonings
reflect the views and the contentions advanced
by the concerned participants also.
230

At DFDR time frame 271, IC 605 was given
(1)
clearance to land by the Bangalore tower.
The wind direction and speed indicated
was 1200 at 5 kts. Thereafter CM1,
(Capt.Fernandez) asked for landing checks
and CM2, (Capt.Gopujkar ) carried out the
landing checks which has been indicated
against DFDRr time frame 275 seconds. CM2
'instructed the cabin crew to take their
stations for landing at 286 seconds.
(2) Against DFDR time frame 290 seconds the
pressure altitude was 339 2 ft., computed
air speed 135.78 kts., a ground speed of
144 kts. and the magnetic heading was
88.240.(cid:9) The engines were at idle and
the SSPPC was 1.50 which 'was very close to
the neutral position. The pitch altitude
was 0.70°.
(3) The elevation of the threshold of R/W 09
at Bangalore is 2872 ft. The R/W rises
steeply. The elevation of the Aerodrome
Reference i-oint (ARP), which is near the
apron 1 (inhere Indian Airlines aircraft
normally park) is 2914 ft. This is an
increase of 42 ft. above the 09 threshold
elevation. Assuming that the elevation
of the R/11 at a parallel location to the
231

ARP as 2914 ft. 1 it would mean an increase
of 42 ft. in about 4000 ft. of R/W. Nor-
mally a narrow body jet transport air-
craft like the A-320 is expected to
touchdown between 1000 to 1500 ft. from
the beginning of the B/W. Assuming the
mean increase in height in this zone is
approximately 18 ft. from threshold,
the elevation in the touchdown area would
be 2890 ft.
The pressure altitude against DFDR time
frame 2:30 would be at time frame 291 as
it is. recorded in word 64. At this
'Point the aircraft was close to 500 ft.
above the touchdown zone elevation. The
speed was 4 kts. above the required mag-
enta speed of 132 kts. and the heading
was correct. The magnetic orientation cf
R/W 09 is 0880.
Assuming an average ground speed of
130 kts. r(144+116)/2:11 the aircraft
would have been horizontally about 6900 ft.
before the second impact point. The
impressions of the second impact point
are approximately 1980 ft. from the thres-
hold of the R/W. Considering the mean
touchdown zone of 1250 ft. from the
beginning 9f the R/W 092 the horizontal
232

distance of the aircraft from the
expected touchdown point at DFDR time
frame 291 would have been 6900+1980+
1250=10130 ft. This would be equivalent
to approximately 1.7 nautical miles. On
a normal 3° approach angle the rate of
descent would be 300 ft. per mile which
would correspond to 500 ft. at this
distance 'ran the touchdown point. The
aircraft was at the correct height at
DFDR time frame 291 seconds on a correct
heading proceeding towards R/W 09 with a
computed airspeed of just 4 kts. above the
required approach speed of 132 kts. Air-
craft was in a position to continue for
a very safe approach and landing at this
point of time; in fact there has peen no
serious controversy on this point.
(6)(cid:9) The revised DFDR data, (flight discretes: 5)
has shovn—auto pilot a-Ltitale--capture
from 292.766 to 294.766 seconds (i.e. Alt.
Star phase). As per CASB (the corelated
timings amended by CASB), at Time Frame
293.9, CM1 called out; "OK 700 ft. rate
of descent"(cid:9) (According to N/s. Capt.Rao
and Capt. Gopal, this time frame ought to
be between 292 and 293.3 seconds'). There-
after CI42 has called "Missed approach
is (cid:9) "; CASB has allotted the timing of
233

293.9 seconds for this statement, while
the two Assessors opine this to be bet-
ween 294.9 and 295.3 seconds. CM2 did
not continue the words regarding missed
approach because of the ATC transmission
giving airfield information, as it is a
normal practice for a pilot to stop
talking whenever there is an ATC trans-
mission
(7)(cid:9) From DFDR revised data fig.9, the auto
throttle speed select discrete which was
showing 1 against time frame 294 has
changed to 0 against - T.F. 295. This is
recorded on word 63. The change over of
auto throttle speed select and the auto
pilot altitude capture have to be analysed
here;
Exhibit 113. was an affidavit by Capt.Gordon
Corps of Airbus IndustriA- this was filed on
25.7.90.
The theory of Airbus Industrie for this time
frame, as indicated in pages 8 and 9 of this
Exhibit from question 29 to answer 33, are
reproduced below:
Q29. .At time 35 to crash CM1 says "OK 700 feet
rate of descent"; Why?
Ans. By reference to the profile shown in
annexure 'C' it is clear that he was
234

just crpossing a 3 degree slope, at about
this tithe. It was a correct change in the
vertical speed mode to maintain a 3 degree
op-e.
Q30. But was the aircraft still in the vertical
speed mode?
Ans: No, it had changed to alt star at time 36.
Q31. So could vertical speed have been reset?
Ana: Yes. but it was not.
Q32. What in fact happened?
Axle: At about the same time CM2 says "Missed
approach is ah (cid:9) h (cid:9) h". As he says
this, he takes the altitude knob and winds
it up towards 6000, but because of alt star
mode the system changes to Climb/Open Climb.
The aircraft is commanded to climb. CM2
does not want that and so, in order to mt the
FD to show a fly down command again and to
get the t. rust reduced again, he again makes
a "wrist flick" on the altittide knob, setting
a level below ground level and reintroducing
Idle/Open Descent. Now he has made a mistake
and he realises it. The altitude knob was
originally a t 3200 feet. If he had wound it
up a few hundred feet and then flicked it
back down again) he could have set about
2000 feet in the FCU window.
235

Q33. Why do you know that this is what he
did?
Ans: As explained by Mr. Gilyot, this is the
only way that the IIYR command trace
could benhump ed" as it is between 38
and about 26 seconds to crash.
(8) UR command of engines 1 and 2 at DFDR time
frame 292 were 1.00 and 1.00. They are
recorded on words 34 and 42. At 294 seconds
it was 1.01 and 1.00 respectively. At 296
seconds it was 1.01 and 1.01. At 298 and
300 seconds it was 1.02 and 1.02. At 302
seconds it was 1.01 and 1.01. At 304, 1.00
and 1.00. At 306, 0.99 and 0.99. At 308
it was 0.98 and 0.98. The minimum command
reached was at 310 and it was 0.97 and 0.97.
(9) PFDR gives both KO command and EPR A.ctuals.
viDR command is registered immediately as
per the order given to the engines. Therms
fore if higher altitude had been selected
by CM2, ERR command value should have regis-
tered a higher value, representing the climb
value. EPR actual is registered only when
engines develop power after acceleration in
case of CLIMB and this will be subsequent
to ERR command.
(10) If CM2 had dialed the altitude knob towards
6000 during ALT STAR mods, the sys(cid:9) would
236

change to Climb/Open Climb. If this had
occured, EIPR command should have immediately
registered the Climb-limit EPR. For example,
at Bombay after take off during climb
through 3000 ft. EAR command value was 1.29.
Actual ERR of the engines would be slow to
pick up and accelerate gradually. The
thrust lever angle of engine 1 is in DFDR
revised data} fig.10 against word 50. •The
thrust lever angle of engine 2 is in the
or' ginal DFDR data fig. 1.1 and recorded in
word.58.
(11)(cid:9) The Alpha Floor was triggered at DFDR
seconds 323.1 and a ctivated at 323.9. There
has been no serious controversy of this point.
This is taking into consideration the mini-
mum of 0.8 seconds delay in activation. The
delay could be upto 1.2 seconds also. EPR
command of Engine 1 and engine 2 at DFDR
seconds 324.531 and 324.656 respectively
have recorded 1. and 1.27. Alpha floor
27
gives TOGA command and the next recording
during time frame 326 has shown the figs. of
1.41 and 1.41. If Alpha floor activation i s
taken as at 323.9 seconds, then EIPR command
has registered a value of 1.27 in 0.6
seconds on its way up. If maximum delay
of 1.2 seconds is considered, alpha floor
activation would be at 324.3 seconds and
237

EPR command recording 1.27 would then be
just 0.2 seconds later.
(12)(a) DFDR data of Indian Airlines A-320 VT-E:PN
which had carried out touch and go landings
and a go around on 27-2-1990 has been made
available to the Court by the office of. the
DGCA. The following were the inferences of
the two pilot Assessors:-
Figs. 1 to 4 refer to tot,ch and go No.l.
Thb parameters being looked into, would be
TLA engine 1 (word 50), TLA engine 2 (word 58)
EPR command engine 1 (word 34) 7 EPR command
engine 2 (word 42) 7 EPR actual engine 1 (woi.d 2)
and EPR actual engine 2 (word 10) against
DFDR time frames. These are available in
figs. 1 and 2. At time frame 2448 TLA
engine 1 and 2, EPR command engine 1 and 2
and EPR actual engine 1 and 2 were all at
idle. AT DFDR seconds 2450.781, TLA 1 was
11.95° and at 2450.906, TLA 2 was at 25.66°.
This indicated a continued movement, of thrust
levers from idle to TOGA as .the next record-
ing at 2452 showed both TLA 1 and 2 at 45°
which is TOGA. Looking at EPR command values,
at time 2450.531 seconds EPR command engine 1
was at 1.33 and at 2450-.656 seconds EPR command
engine 2 was at 1.39. The increase of
EPR actual of both engines was slower. EPR
command has moved almost immediately to
the maximum ord6red thrust corresponding to
238

thrust lever angles. Fuel flow increase
has started at 2449 time frame only.
Against time frame 2470, both thrust levers
were at TOGA and EPR command was at 1.38.
Against time frame 2472, both thrust levers
have been brought back to MCT (maximum
continuous thrust) position showing TLA
angles of 34.8 for engine 1 and 34.1. for
engine 2. 4R commands have dropped imme-
diately to 1.32. As auto thrust control
would be active in position MCT and below,
the EPR subsequently have varied both in
this position and the climb position.
Considering touch and go No.2 (fig.5 to 8),
similar immediate increase and decrease of
EPR command corresponding to thrust lever
position can be seen against time frames
2782, 2784, 2816, 2818 and 2820. Against
2818 it must be remembered that EPR commands
1 and 2 have been recorded before the thrust
lever angles 1 and 2 hence the figures co-
relate. Considering the go around (figs. 9 to
12), it is noted that a simulated engine
failure of engine No.2 has occurred a few
seconds after TOGA had been applied for the
go around. The power was restored to climb
power after about 20 seconds. At time frame
3150, TLA 1 and TLA 2 were in the climb
detent recorded as 24.61°. As auto thrust
was active during approach, EPR command and
239

ERR actual of both engines• were at 1.07.
At 3152 we see both TLA at 45° (i. e. TOGA)
and ERR command has immediately recorded
1.39 on both engines.(cid:9) ERR actuals of
both engines still .remained at 1.07 at
that time frame but showed an increase at
3153. TLA engine 2 which was at 45° at
3162 seconds has been moved to idle position
(0.350) as, recorded at 3164. EPR command
engine 2 has immediately dropped to 1.00.
EPR actual which was 1.38- at time 3162
showed 1.37 at time 3163 and 1.24 at time
3164. Looking at fig. it of the go around
and comparing fuel flow of engine 1 and 2
at 3163 we find deceleration order has
already been given at 3163. Considering
time frames-3120 and 318 2, TLA 2 has moved
from idle (0.35°) to climb (24.96°). EPR
command has jumped from 0.98 to 1.29. Actual
EgR has remained at 0.99 at both these
times and has increased only later. Simi-
larly at time frames 3190 and 310 2 seconds,
TLA 1 has moved from TOGA to climb, the
EPR command engine 1 has changed from 1.39
to 1.29 but EAR actual has remained at
1.40 and reduced later to auto thrust
command.
(12)(b) The DFDR data of the flight test carried
out by Airbus Industrie at Toulouse on
240

20.6.1990 show the fbilowing:-
(1) The T 1 series data tare the repeat of
the Bangalore scenario. Referring to
page T 1.5.4, EPR command at 15.10.12
was 0.977 for engine 1. and 0.977 for
engine 2. The next recording at 15.10.14
showed EPR command 1.305 for both engines
and at 15.10.167 the TOGA command of 1.422
has been recorded fbr both engines. From
page T 1.2.7 SISPPO was 1.3.27° at time
15.10.12 and 14.94° at time 15.10.13.
Alpha floor would have been triggered
between these two time frames. EPR command 1
has registered 1.305 at 15 10 14.531 seconds.
An immediate EPR command increase has been
recorded. A short while later at time
15.11.04 EPR command engine 1 was 1.430
in word 34. Immediately thereafter TLA
engine 1 at word 50 has shown 36.92°
compared to 44.66° two seconds earlier.
This As from page T 1.12.5. At 15.11.06,
the TLA engine 1 was at 24.97° which
appears to be the climb detent on that
aircraft and EPR command engine 1 has
shown 1.309. Again this has shown that
EPR command' s increase and decrease are
almost immediate. The EPR command was
1.305 which has remained constant till
15. 11. 16 indicating that this was the
climb EPR value under those conditions.
241

Later thrust modulation has started.
•(ii) airing the second profile under direct
law referring to. page T 2.12.2 at
15.16.44 MA. engine 1 was 0.32° indi-
cating idle position. EPR command
enginelwas 0.996. At 15.16.46 TLA engine
1 is at 44.66° and EPR canmand has
registered 1.422.(cid:9) This would be the
TOGA power.
(iii) Looking at page T 3.12.3, TLA engine 1
was 0.32° at 15.23.32 with EPR command
at 0.996. At 15.23.34 MA engine 1 was
42.55° and EPR command engine 1 was at
1.324.. The next recording at 15.23.361
TLA engine 1 was at 44.66°
and EPR command
engine 1 was 1.422. At time frame
15.23.34 the EPR command was recorded
against word 34 which was earlier than
TLA engine 1 at word 50.
(iv) Referring to page T 3.12.5 another
engine acceleration has been carried out
at time 15.24.40. TLA engine 1 was 0.32°
with EPR command engine 1 at 0.996. At
15.24.42 MA engine 1 was at 411.66° and
Fh'R command engine 1 was at 1.418.
(v) In all these above engine. accelerations
the EPR actuals have responded slowly
242

cceunand has registered
though(cid:9)
immediately. From the above it
follows that whenever a limit thrust
order is given NPR command reflects
that order immediately. Climb/Open
Climb is a thrust mode. Immediately
this order is given, EPR command would
register the value of Climb thrust.
When aircraft' starts climbing and alti-
tude capture occurs the thrust modu-
'lation would commence. Similarly idle
open descent is a thrust mode where
idle thrust is ordered. The EPR command
should register the order immediately
though EPR actual may lag behind. EPR
command would start modulating again on
altitude caputre (or'Alt Star).
( 11)(cid:9) In case of VT-N, at 234 seconds
altitude capture phase has ended and auto
thrust speed select has shown zero at
295. If-the theory that C/12 had moved
the altitude towards 16000 during ALT
STAR and Climb/Open Climb had engaged,
EPR command should have registered
Climb EPR under those conditions. This
would have been close to 1.28 to 1.30.
(14)(cid:9) VT-EPN has shown a slow increase in EPR
command which is matched by the Ell R
243

actuals. 1R command which was 1.01 for
engine 1 and 1.00 for engine 2, at DFDR
seconds of 294 has only gone up to 1.02
for both engines at DFDR time of 298 and
it has remained constant at DFDR time of
300 seconds after which the ERR canmand
has slowly reduced. If a "wrist flick"
had been done selecting a very low alti-
tude as explained by Airbus Industrie after
Climb/Open Climb, the EPR command should
have immediately changed to 0.98 or 0.97
on both engines from the climb thrust
EPR command. This has not occurred. The
Airbus theory of these modes namely CLIMB/
OPEN CLIMB and IDLE/OPE? DESCITT having
occurred cannot be accepted.
The ,change of auto thrust speed select
discrete cannot be accepted with certainty.
Airbus Industrie in its letter
Al/E FS 420.0208/90 of September 19th 1990
has shown Open Climb and Open Descent as
thrust modes.(cid:9) On VT-EPN the thrust was
modulating during the times in question.
When you look at the entire accident flight
data, whenever the auto throttle speed
select has shown zero indicating a thrust
mode, the EPR command engine 1 has been at
a constant thrust value.(cid:9) This has been
shown till time 2637 seconds after which the
7ELLI

climb schedule has been changed.(cid:9) The EvR
command is modulated during the cruise and
during descent it held a fairly steady
value. It must be renembered during descent
minimum idle would be
until slats extension
the criteria and this value would depend
upon the ECS demand. After slats extension,
idle open descent will order approach idle.
(16)(cid:9) Fran •fig.9 and fig. 11 of the revised DFDR
data of VT-13'N, auto thrust speed select
discrete has changed fran 0 to a. at time
274 seconds. At 248 seconds EPR command
of both engines have changed .from 0.96 to
1.01 and at 250. the F.PR canmand was 1.00 on
both engines and later it decreased to 0.98
and 0.96. The EPR actuals increased to
1.00 at 250 and return to 0.99 at 254 on
both engines. Similarly EPR command has
shown an increase at time frame 278 and auto
thrust speed select discrete was showing 1.
All this was during the period when the air-
craft was descending with vertical speed
selected at -1000 fpm (rate of descent of
1000 feet per minute). Fran fig. 2 we find
that the rate of descent which was 1410 fpm
at 246 was reduced to 1090 fpm at 248 after
which it again increased to over 1600 fpm at
252. Similarly the rate of descent which
was 1410 fpm at 277 was reduced to 1090 fpm
245

at 278 and again increased to 1410 fpm
at 279. From the CVR we know that
vertical speed had been selected and
hence it is confirmed that during these
time frames vertical speed was active.
This is a thrust modulating speed/verti-
cal speed mode and the thrust would
adjust to maintain speed. If rate of
descent is reduced, more thrust would -be
needed to maintain speed. Corresponding
to the reduced rate of descent, the zon
command has increased followed by. EPR
actual and later when the rate of descent
was increased) the EPR command and EPR
actual have decreased. At time frame
though rate of descent had been decreased
to 961 fpm, similar reaction on EPR
command has not been observed, but fig.1
revised data shows that at that point the
CAS had increased by a few knots whereby
the thrust requirement was offset by the
speed reduction requirement. The slight
increase and reduction o f EPR command and
EPR actual correlates with auto thrust
speed mode being active at the time frames
mentioned.
(17)(cid:9) EPR command' indicating either the climb
value or the idle value at time frames
246

295 to 304 to indicate the engagement of
Climb/Open Climb or Idle/Open Descent mode
is not found. In case the auto thrust
speed select discrete is considered faulty,
and if 700 ft. per minute rate of descent
is assumed to have been selected by CM2,
inference is, during time frame 295 air-
craft has left pressure altitude of 3300 ft.
This would have been the altitude selected
by the pilots as the MDA was 3280 as per the
Indian Airlines aerodrome operating minima
chart for Bangalore. ALT STAR would no
longer be available. The slight increase
in the EP R, both command and actual, to
1.02 would correlate with a reduced rate of
descent toget ott to the normal approach
angle. At that stage the CAS was slowly
dropping towards the target of 132 kts.
Aircraft having a tailwind component would
need a slightly higher rate of descent to
maintain the normal approach path. This
possibility can only be explained upto
DFDR time frame of 298 or 299 wherein the
CAS was close to the target speed (allowing
for error of 1 kt. in CAS recording).
(18)(cid:9) After the auto call outs of Radio Altitude
400 and 300 ft, CM2 suddenly announced at
about 305 seconds, "you are descending on
idle open desQent ah all this time." Fran
247

the tone it appears that it was a surprised
type of remark. The tone does not indi-
cate that it was a sarcastic remark. This
call indicates the engagement of Idle/open
descent around 304 or 305 seconds. CM2 at
about time frame 308.9 asked CM1, "you want
the FDs OFF now?" ail answered, "Yah" at 309
or 310 and again he said at 311.7 second "OK,
I have already put it off." From this
conversation it is natural to presume that
CMI put his PD off somewhere between this
conversation. But FMGG used FD mode has
already shown '0' at 307 seconds. This
was one of the parameters used by Airbus
Industrie to say FD 1 had been put off.
If all had put off the FD earlier he would
not normally say, "Yah " and "OK, I already
put it off", but he would have immediately
answered; "I have already put it off".
At about 313 CM2 finding that his flight
director had not been put off by all who
had put off the ED on his side, called out
"But you did not put off mine". This
call appears to be natural because whoever
puts off the FDs should put off both
though normally during manual flight it would
be the PNF to do so. (Capt.Fernandez had
operated as co-pilot from the time he
started line flights until this ill-fated
flight where he was C14-1). At this stage
it was impossible to expect that CM2 would
not have tried to put off his flight direc-
248

tor. If he had tried, there is a possi-
bility that the FD may not have gone off
due to proper contact not having been made
on tie FD push button.
No/many any pilot would look at the mode
(19)(cid:9)
annunciation on the FMA to look for the
mode change that was anticipated. In this
case the anticipated change was from Idle/
Open ,Descent to Speed. As this did not
occur on the FMA CM2 must have been per-
plexed. Even if FDs are "OFF" and if
auto pilot is "OE" the mode annunciator
would have remained. DUring these few
seconds the 200 ft. call has come between
316 and 317 and CM2 must have looked at
the auto pilot indications both on the
FCU and on the FNA and instinctly
while looking at these things to say,
"You are on auto pilot still."
(a))(cid:9) With the type of low speed display that
is available in the ii-320 it is impossible
to imagine that a pilot when he looks at
the PFD can overlook the speed of the
aircraft having gone below the magenta
and the top of the VLS amber strip. Even
if the engines were at idle and the pilot
pushes the thrust levers forward when the
speed tends to drop below V-app 1. e.
Magenta speed, by the time the thrust comes
249

on there would be a loss of about 6 to
10 kts.
(21) Capt. Rao and Capt. Gopal have an experience
of nearly 40,000 hours of flying as Pilots;
they are emphatic when they say that they
never saw a pilot or a coapilot in the
airlines, ever dropping speed below
V-app without reacting immediately on
thrust levers.
(22) Questions were asked of Capt. Gordon Corps
during his examination and his answers
are as below:
4: "From your experience as well as
experience of other instructors of
Airbus Industrie or Aeroformation have
you ever come across or heard of a
pilot whose airspeed monitoring was
such that he could not identify the
danger zone from the top of the VLS
strip to the V Alpha Max. and permitted
the speed to drop from 5 kts. above
VLS to V Alpha Max?"
A:(cid:9) "No. I have not found any one who
had difficulty in indentifying the
low speed scale."
250

"Do you agree that a pilot of any of
these types would try to maintain the
speed trend indicator at the absolute
minimum, preferably unseen, to fly
accurately when he is at the correct
desired speed?"
A:(cid:9) "Yes."
"Would you also agree that if the desired
Q:(cid:9)
speed such as Magenta or V approach is
lower than the actual speed of the aircraft
and the speed is reducing towards the
desired speed, the downward speed indicator
would not be a cause for serious concern
when auto thrust is on?"
A:(cid:9) "It depends on how long it is."
"Would you agree that if the present speed
Q:(cid:9)
is above the VLS amber strip there is no
cause for serious concern?"
A:(cid:9) "In general, Yes. But it also depends on
the sign and the magnitude of the speed
trend. "
n• "Would that apply even when auto thrust
.1. •
is on"?
II n
es
.1: "Would you also agree that on these modern
glass cockpit,aircraft with such speed
indications a pilot does not read the speed
251

figure but flies to achieve the desired
speed indications?"
A:(cid:9) "I do not know what every pilot does. But
I believe that they should be conscious
of the indicated speed."
(23)(cid:9) Capt.Steve Last who is the Chairman of
IFALPA Aircraft Design & Operations
Committee (International Federation of
Airline Pilots associations) presented a
paper for ,A.erotec 1989 at Anahie-n, USA, in
Septanber 1989 on the subject of "A-320
and B 757 on the line: a line pilots pers-
pective."(cid:9) This paper was also discussed
at the IFALPA Accident Analysis Committee
meeting at London on 17th and 18th October
1989. This paper is Exhibit 144. Para 4
on page 4 is relevant here. It is quoted
below:
have to say that I have consi-
derable reservations about the
total airspeed/thrust control and
monitoring concept on the A-320.
This is due to the fact that there
is so much reliance on the combi-
nation of auto throttle and INS
for speed managanent. As I stated
earlier, the best feature of the
airspeed indication is the trend
252

arrow, which is very compelling.
Actual airspeed value is not. The
normal operation is in reality to
drive the speed trend arrow towards
the selected airspeed triangle, and
at that point to minimise the
trend arrow. During approach with
the normal "managed speed", the
selected airspeed is driven by the
FMS to values which are provided
minimum ground speed, and ere derived
from values inserted by the pilot for
surface wind, and actual wind at
current altitude.
As a result, the pilot relies totally
on the FMS output for approach speed
information".
When this was shown to Capt.Gordon Corps during
his examination, he said it was an individual
opinion of a respected member of the community.
However, Capt•Gordonr'Corps asserted that,
with regard to the auto thrust system, at a recent
conference at Toulouse, there was unanimous
253

support for the auto thrust system of the A-320.
On 27th June 1990, representatives from IFALPA
member associations which operate A,-320 had met
with Airbus Industrie to discuss the A-320 auto
thrust system.; Airbus Industrie captains Bernard
Ziegler, Piero Baud and Nick Warner gave a
presentation .on the subject of A-320- auto
thrust system and energy awareness. At the
time of this presentation S/F/O Capt.Richard
Pike, Chairman, New .Aircrafts Study Group of
British Airline Pilots Association made a
presentation on the subject of energy awareness
and control in the A-320 and future Airbus
products. Later IFALPA pilots user group
commentary on the Airbus.Industrie presentation
has been prepared and sent to various user airlines.
These papers were circulated to the participants
and these do not confirm Capt.Gordon Corps
statement• quoted above. Anxiety has been
expressed about the auto thrust system and
the speed indications. In spite of all this
Capt.G.Corps seems to think that "For reasons
that none of us will probably ever know
it would seem that both of these experienced
pilots made a similar mistake at the same
time" as stated on page 118.
TI„,ro more questions and answers of the
witness are necessary to be quoted here:-
254

(cid:9)
"You have been a certification test
4:
pilot having flown many different
types of aircraft before ccming on to
the glass cockpit aircraft of Airbus
Industrie. The two pilots of the ill-
fated flight had flown on earlier
technology aircraft safely and effici-
ently including monitoring speed pro-
perly as, they were alive to convert on
to A-320. Do you have any comment in
respect of air speed indicator on the
earlier and the present A-310/,A-320
aircraft as speed is a primarily para-
meter of the flight?"
As(cid:9) "I think that the speed indication on
the A-320 is vastly superior to that of
conventional aircraft because of the
displaying things that were not possible
wi th cony en tional instruments. "
"13ut still you think as stated in your
affidavit the pilots are able to appre-
ciate the loss of speed which they have
never done before on the earlier conven-
tional aircraft?"
A:(cid:9) "Aircraft systems are duplicated or
triplicated to make them failure tolerant.
With r egard to the pilots we have two
pilots and we have crew procedures which
255

are intended 'to achieve the ,same fbr
the human as we can achieve for the
systems, for reasons that none of us
will probably ever know it...would seem
that both of these experienced pilots
made a similar mistake at the same time.".
(24)(cid:9) During these happenings, certainly C1•12
was looking at the RIA on the PFD and
the.0 to check what has gone wrong,
as the mode has not changed. Every time
he has looked at the PFD in •th.is period
the speed has been well below the desired
approach speed. The CAS went below 132 kts
at DFDR time 296/297 seconds, 127 kts
at 303 seconds, at 313 seconds it was
119 kts and at 329 seconds it was 106 kts.
If the magenta speed was 132 the amber
arc from VLS would have commenced at
127 and the red bar of V Alpha Fax
would have been around 111 kts. Normally,
the pilots should have been the speed
fall below the magenta triangle id
the VLS amber sector. V alpha prot
speed as per 1.09.10 pg 9, revision 11,
would have been between 115.5 and 118.5.
The speed dropped below V alpha prot
somewhere between 314 and 318. The
range of V aloha floor from the same
FCOM pagI e was 11 2.3 to 115.4 but at
256

that speed the alpha floor was not triggered.
Even if alpha floor had triggered at the
lowest speed of the range, i.e., at 112.3 kts,
it would have occurred between time frames
319 and 320 giving a margin of over 3 seconds
earlier than the actual alpha floor triggering.
Information given,in this FCOM page.is
either incorrect or not according to aircraft
design.
(25)(cid:9) The speed has dropped 26 kts. below the
desired V-app of 132. The speed trend
indicator, the VLS, V alpha prot. and V alpha
max indications and the magenta speed
which can vary depending'upon the environmental
conditions are so obvious and compelling.
If the aircraft speed lubber line is above
magenta triangle, the pilot may never
read the absolute speed value. So long
as the speed is at magenta or above there
would be no sense of anxiety at any time.
"Until the phrase "Hey we are going down"
uttered by C141 at 324.05 seconds there has
been no anxiety and both the pilots have been
very calm in all their expressions. Speed
had dropped to 106 kts one second earlier
and had increased to 109 kts at 324. It
is impossible to believe that any pilot
would be calm under these conditions. The
speed drop from 322 kts to 106 kts has
c
about 297 seconds to 323
occurred from
seconds, a period of 26 seconds. A pilot
during any approach would be looking at.
257

his air speed indicator very very frequently
as every pilot would know that it is the
parameter to keep the aircraft flying.
In spite of nearly 10000 hours of experience
each had on earlier technology planes .both
of them have overlooked speed on conversion
to A-320. Again this is impossible to
believe. The only way that this phenomenon
c,an be explained is that something has
occurred during these vital seconds from
about 296 or 29? DFDR time frame which
has changed the display of the low speed
indications to a lower value. By the
very nature of the low speed warning
display if the lubber line has been
above the Magenta and the Vls, there would
be no anxiety. Only when CM1 realised
the aircraft was going down he has started
instinctively reacting on the side stick
control pulling it aft to the full position
relying on the alpha floor protection.
When engine response was slow he has
called out "Hey we are going down" and
again instinctively pushed the thrust
levers forward. By that time accident
had already begun due to non-availability
of speed, height and time. Subsequent
258

auto call outs are a result and the
concerned call outs have been explained
earlier under heading "First Touchdown"
and "Second Impact".
(26)(cid:9) Capt.G.Corps stated that he would not
be able to tell the EPR readings for this
engine or the Ni readings for the CRI 56
engine that would be necessary for an
aircraft in configuration full descending
at about 1000 ft/mt. with a tail wind
of about 10 kts. when,
(a) speed is established at V-app and
(b) speed is reducing to V-app.
Even though he is a test pilot, as a test
pilot presently of Airbus Industrie he
would be flying the two types of A-320.
This gives ,room for suspicion that engine
power awareness may not be there in a
good number of A-3g0 pilots. 1,1ay be this
could be due. to the very limited movement
of thrust levers needed to be carried out
by the pilots during the normal flight.
The thrust levers not moving would be a
disadvantage, as when thrust is at idle
a pilot would never knew unless he looks
259

at and reads the thrust figure frcm the
engine EPR indication on the SCAM. From
VT E?O circuits and landings and the
previous landing at Bombay by VT-EPN
(ILS approach onto WIT 27), it is learnt
that the power of approximately 1.05
EPR is needed during approach with con-
figuration full. 1.05 EPR would be very
close to the lower limit. If due to any
gusty winds if the speed increases, the
thrust valid come to idle under auto
thrust control and it would not be abnor-
mal. If they were 'moving auto throttles',
the pilot would feel(cid:9) through the
thrust levers that the thrust was at idle
and no pilot would accept such a position
on short final even if the .speed was
slightly higher than V-apP.
One side stick control movement is not
reflected on the side stick control of
the other pilot. Capt.Gopujkar could
never have realised that Capt. Fernandez
had started pulling the side stick aft
from a time as early as 316 seconds. If
conventional control column was avail-
able with dual control movement even with
FLY 3Y WIRE systen, Capt. Gopujkar would
have realised this movement irrespective
of what he was doing at that time. If
260

at that time of 316 or for that matter
even unto 320 seconds, if the thrust
levers had been moved unto TOGA this
aircraft would have survived.
(28) From the data available, it is not
possible to definitely conclude that
IDLE/OPEN DESCENT was due to the selection
of a lower altitude by the crew during-
Alt star . Even Airbus Industrie, when
they had to explain the uncommanded CLIMB/
OPEN CLIMB engagement during the bird hit.
iii,lident at Delhi on 10-8-1989 have stated
that "the exact reason for CLIMB/OPEN
CLIMB mode engagement cannot be determined
with available data. FCU selected alti-
tude would be necessary to state defi-
nitely on the subject. This data is not
available.
(29) We have the identical situation wherein
IDLE/OPEN DESCENT mode is engaged at about
304 or 305 seca. end data is not available
to identify why.
(30) Similarly there is no data available to
explain the reason why two exnerienced
pilots have not exnressed any anxiety
even though a sneed loss of 26 Kts. below
Vann has occurred. We can give only a
possibility to ecinlain how it may have
occurred. It would be for all concerned
authorities to deenly investigate if this'`

possibility could occur due to a very remote
computer malfunction.
(31) The commencement of the chime just before
the crash is at DFDR of 327,8 seconds. Airbus
Industrie have considered that this chime is
due to disconnecting auto throttle by the
pilots using the instinctive disconnect buttons.
(32) The time duration between the action of
disconnecting auto throttle and the begining
of the chime was checked by one of the
Assessors, Capt.B.S.Gopal on VT.EPQ on 23-9-1990
at Bombay. The time varied between 0.9 to
1.2 seconds. Whether it was disconnected
using the quick disconnect push buttons on the
thrust levers or the auto thrust push button
on the FCU, the period remained the same.
From the co-relation of the CVR after scientific
analysis it is observed that the gap between
the thrust lever movement and the beginning of
the chime on VT-EPN is little more than
3 seconds considering the completion of the
thrust lever movement. This does not correspond
to what happened on VT-EPQ.
(33) As explained earlier under 2.1 "CVR DFDR
CO_RMATION", if thrust lever movement is
moved from what has been established to a later
time, the aircraft would still be in the air
when DFDR has recorded that the aircraft was
on the ground. There are many items which
262

can cause the occurrance of a chime below
800 feet and some of them are not recorded on
the DFDR. These items have been indicated by
letter No.AI/E FS 420.0102/90 of 3.5.1990
addressed to one of the Assessors, Capt.B.S.Gopal.
We are unable to confirm that this chime was
due to disconnecting the auto thrust by the
pilots using the instinctive disconnect push
buttons. Auto throttle would have automaticall:Y
got disconnected even without any actions on
these buttons as the thrust levers were moved
from climb to TOGA below 100 feet radio altitude.
FCOM 1.11.30, page 61 refers.
The calls of Sink Rate 30, Sink Rate 10
(34)
the crash sounds have all been explained earlier
under CVR DFDR co-relation, first touch down,
second impact, etc.
(35) e From the DFDR data of the previous landing
of VT EPN at Bombay, it is observed that the
aircraft made a landing on R/W 27. The aircraft
touched down, just after DFDR time 6679 seconds
as the radio altimeter has shown 0 at that
time but we have not seen thrust lever movement
to idle against time frame 6679. It is possible
that aircraft would have touched down just
at the end of this time frame or slightly later.
The pilots had used both the auto pilots in
command mode. This is only possible if an ILS
pproach has been carried out. The auto pilots
a
z
263

were disconnected at 6644 just 35 seconds before
touch down. The FD discrete. has shown that
it was "ON" throughout but FGC 1 FNA used has
changed the status from 1 to 0 between 6658 and
6662 and FGC 1 used for FD has changed between
6659 and 6663. This is very similar to- what
has been shown on the VT-EPN data. But as
this was an ILS approach there was absolutely
no• necessity for putting the FDs off by the
pilot as the FDs would continue to give excellent
guidance all the way to touch down. We do
not expect a pilot to put off one 'FD on very
short final during an ILS approach as'it is
neither a requirement nor a necessity.
(36) In the DFDR data of VT-EP 0 which carried
out some circuits and landings most probably
at Delhi airport on 28-9-1990 we find that
the FD discrete has shown "ON" throughout the
data from 2257 seconds to 3153 seconds. The
FGC 1 WS used (17) has remained "OFF" through-
out. But the FMGC used FD mode was showing
1 indicating that it was in use from 2257
till 2547 after which it has gone off.
(37) From the explanation of the discretes given
by Airbus Industrie it is rather difficult
to explain as to what exactly has happened
looking at the DFDR data of VL.EPO, VT-EF'N
landing at Bombay and VT-EPN crash. We are
not sure that the only purpose of the discrete
FGC 1 BUS .ised and the FEGC used FD mode is
264

to establish that the FD 1 is "ON" or "OFF ".
We have no means of answering if a certain
failure has occurred in these busses of the
FMGC which has caused these changes in the
recordings.
(38) The engines were at idle when alpha floor
triggering occurred at DFDR time frame 323.9 •
seconds. The engines did not have adequate
time to accelerate to take off thrust before
the first touch down of the aircraft et 329.8
seconds. The flight profile after the first
touch down, as explained earlier, was such
that the aircraft could not have survived even
if engines had attained take off thrust at
the time of the second impact.
(39) Assuming alpha floor activation at 323.9
seconds, this accident has commenced at L20.9
seconds. From that time onwards this aircraft
had absolutely no chance of survival even if
thrust levers had been moved forward. This is
based on the performance under pitch normal
law as evaluated both from simulator experiments
and Airbus Industrie flight tests.
(40) Whether the first touch down was at 6.125 g
or it was a smooth touch down, that would not
have affected the fa..te of this flight in any
manner. But it is very essential for the Court
of Inquiry to establish what exactly happened
before coming to itny conclusion using whatever
data End evidence that ate available.
265

(cid:9)
After landing checks were completed
(1)
CM2 asked cabin crew at DFDR second 286, to be
at their stations for landing. DFDR data re-
vealed that at Second 292 altitude capture
phase started at 3358 feet altitude and
lasted only for 2 seconds upto 29i4 second
when altitude was 3326. It can be presumed
that th6 aircraft was coming down towards
Minimum Decision Altitude of 3270 feet which
was selected earlier. At DFDR second 294
CM1 asked for 700 ft/min. rate of descent
as revealed by CVR. CM2, in reply, uttered
the words "Missed approach is ....". His
voice was not audible thereafter due to some
ATC transmission. DFDR data further revealed
that at DFDR second 295 the auto thrust
speed mode, which was active since 1000 ft/min.
rate of descent was selected, changed to idle
open descent which is possible only if a lower
altitude is selected on FaT during alt. capture
Phase. As a matter of fact such a selectioni
had cancelled the alt. star phase prematurely
at DFDR second 294. Since no DFDR data are
available to indicate the FCU selections,
some possibilities have to be considered to
know why .and how the speed mode changed to
266

idle open descent mode which was not the
desired mode at this stage. 3 such possi-
bilities can be considered.
(1) As suggested by the inspector of
accident, CM2, while making a selection
for 700 ft/min.rate of descent as de-
sired by the CM1 mistook the altitude
selection knob on FOU as the Vertical
spe-ed selection knob and selected
700 ft.altitude. Since this was a
lower altitude and the aircraft was
in alt. star phase the aircraft went
into idle open descent. Since the
two knobs are side by side, Capt.
Thergaonkar, Capt.Richard Steele,
Capt.P.K.Gupta and Capt.Gordon Corrs
have confirmed that such a mistake was
possible. Capt.Thergaonkar had ad-
mitted that he himself committed such
mistakes. He had seen a French Pilot
committing the same mistake in Hydera-
bad simulator, vide page 6 of his
deposition.
(2) Airbus Industrie suggested that (242,
at 294 DFDR second first selected a
higher altitude towards missed
approach alt.of 6000 feet and then
realising that this was not the proper
time for such selection as the aircraft
267

would go to the open climb since alt
star phase was active, immediately
reversed the alt knob to a lo:•rer alti-
tude by a wrist flick. This caused
the aircraft to go to idle open
descent. To support their theory, it
was stated that from DFDR second 294
the EPR command slightly increased for
a short ,while (a hump in the EPR CMD
graph) which was pos sible for a hi gher
selection of altitude momentarily.
(3)(cid:9) Due to malfunction of computer or FCU
reset or due to serious incorrect
signal input to FCU from RIGC 6 FOC
and FCU reset itself the altitude
figure in altitude window of FCU
changed to 100 feet which was a lower
altitude than the aircraft altitude
at DFDR second 303. This caused the
aircraft to go to idle open descent,
vide question by the Court to Capt.Gordon
Corps in his deposition on Page 100.
(2)(cid:9) Since possibility (1) does not explain
the slight EPR command increase from
DFDR second 294, possibility (2) may be
considered as close to reality. This
268

suggestion of Airbus Industrie is also
in consonance with CM2's utterence of
the words "Missed approach is (cid:9) 'V
indicating that he intended initially
to set 6000 feet go around altitude.
In respect of possibility (3)
Airbus Industrie forwarded a reply as
promised by Capt.Gordon Corps in Page
101 of his deposition, vide letter
No.AITB-fs 420.0214/90 dated 1P.P.P0.
It has been stated that "there were situ-
ations where the speed display in the
FCU window has reverted to 100 kts.
they are as follows:
- FMG Cl CB action in flight
- FM reset.
With regard to unwanted change of FCU
altitude there has never been a report
of any such malfunction. It only occurs
at FCU power up during start".
Moreover, the FMGC was functioning
satisfactorily before DFDR second 303 and
worked satisfactorily after this time also
as indicated by triggering of alpha Protection
and increasing EPR command etc. FUrther,
this hypothetical case of computer mal-
function at 203 DFDR second does not
explain why speed mode changed to idle
open descent at DFDR second 294/2P5
'which
is about 8 seconds earlier to 203 second.
269

Regarding FCU reset/failure re-
ference may be made to FCOM Vol.3
Chapter 3.02.11 Page 4 Rev.10 (abnormal
and emergency procedures) where FCU
fault has been described. It is 'stated
that with both FCU channel's failed
- all FCU controls are inoperative
ftutothrat, P1+2 and ED14-2 are not
available (except in land track
or go-around mode where only auto
thrust is lost).
etc.
It is known from conversations in the CVR
that FD1 and FD2 were working. Secondly,
if auto thrust is lost there will be a
single chime associated with ECAM warning
FCU 1 + 2 fault and Master Caution Light.
But in the CVR there was no chime recorded.
Further auto thrust worked satisfactorily
as indicated by alpha prot and alpha floor
activation. These two things clearly indi-
cate that both FCU channels did not fail.
For a single FCU channel failure the other
channel takes over and proper FCU function
s not affected.
(cid:9)
(4) Further 100 feet altitude indication
would have immediately indicated to the
270

pilot that it was an absurd indication
because Bangalore Airport elevation it-
self was about 3000 feet. From alt. star
phase he should have known that the air-
craft was approaching the last selected
altitude i.e., MDA about 3270 feet. At
DFDR second 301 RA call out "four hundred"
should have indicated that the actual
altitude was 400 feet AGL. Lastly ho
should have looked at the standby
(conventional) sensitive altimeter to
know the correct altitude and taken ne-
cessary corrective action.
It is pertinent to quote here,
para 3.7.3.3 of page 3.19 of Chapter III
of Indian Airlines' Operations Manual
which states "It is especially important
that the Co-pilot will automatically inform
the Pilot-in-Command of any abnormal devi-
ations from the approach procedure, alti-
tude, rate of descent, speed and timing
or the points covered in para 3.7.1.3
above. In order to detect false communi-
cations in any of the Pilot's instruments
systems, momentary cross checks should be
made by the co-pilot". "Should a mal-
function or any other situation occur or
remain when below 1000 feet above airport
elevation land be of such a nature as to
271

render a landing hazardous, the approach
should be discontinued. During all
approaches, the co-pilot has an important
function as a safety pilot and must not
hesitate to inform the pilot in command
of any abnormality or procedural discre-
pancy." Therefore, if due to some reason
or the other the altitude window of FUJ
changed to 100 feet it was CM2's duty to
automatically inform CM1 and as RA call
out "four hundred" has already come at
301 second the approach could have been
discontinued to avoid hazardous landing,
if considered so.
Therefore, there is no reason to
believe that the FMGC or other computer
could have malfunctioned only at DFDR
second 2P4 or '3D3 just to change the
speed mode to idle open descent only to
justify calmness of pilots for 11 seconds
or to be detected by CM2 at DFDR.second
305 respectively.
Regarding selection of vertical
speed during alt.star phase Capt.Guyot and
Capt.Gordon Corps of Airbus Industrie
stated in their depositions that this
selection is possible Nit the vertical
272

speed knob had to be pulled twice. This
view was contested by ICPA who informed
that one of the Indian Airlines Pilots
carried out this exercise both in simu-
lator and in flight and confirmed that
vertical speed cannot be selected during
alt. capture phase.
The procedure prescribed in FCOM
Vol.1 Chapter 1.11.30 para B.5.1 Item (2)
in page 32 will enable a selection of
.vertical speed. It states "Pull V/S-FPA
knob (after selection of a new altitude).
Engagement- of the mode is made on clrrent
V/S - FPA. Window is synchronised on
current V/S - FPA. Select a new V/9 -
FPA value, if needed. Selection may be
made before engagement". First selection
of a new altitude would have killed the
alt. star phase and then pulling of V/S
knob followed by a desired selection i.e.,
700 ft/min. would have achieved the re-
quired V/S. Therefore, after selection
of a new altitude (lower in this case)
had 700 ft/min. rate of descent been
selected by CM2 as stated above the
aircraft would have gone to speed mode
and the accident could have been averted.
(7)(cid:9) The CV never attempted to select 700
ft/min.rate of descent on the V/9 knob
273

is evident from the following:
(a) He spoke about "missed approach"
i.e., go around altitude. It is
very unlikely that he would speak
something and do something else,
i.e., speaking about go,around
altitude and selecting V/S of 700
ft/min.which is not coherent.
(b) At that time, A/T speed select
parameter of DFDR changed from
speed mode to idle open descent
mode due to altitude selection
(changed from 1 to 0). If V/S
was selected it would have remained`
in speed mode (i.e., 1). This
parameter changed four times from
DFDR second 225 according to Pilot's
selection. Therefore, there is no
reason to doubt this parameter.
(c) He confirmed thereafter that air-
craft was descending on idle open
descent (you are descending on idle
open descent mode ha, all this time).
(d) In CVR there is no indication that
CM2 even acknowledged CM1 request for
setting V/S of 700 ft/min.
6 seconds later "RA (Radio Altimeter)
call out - four hundred" - came at DFDR
274

second 301. At DFDR second 305 Radio
altimeter call out "three hundred" came.
Then GM2 realised that the aircraft was
descending in idle open descent, and said
"You are descending on idle open descent
ha, all this time".
It. appears that immediately after
selection of the lower altitude am2 did not
scan the flight parameters to see the re-
sult of his selection. It was his.duty to
see the mode change and announce. He also
did not check the aircraft speed and announce
the deviation of speed if it was less by
5 kts. than the required approach speed.
In this connection reference is made to
descent/approach and landing check list
detailed in FCOM Chapter 3.03.16 page 1
rev.l1 which states:
"(PNF) Flight parameters....Check.
PNF CALLS OUT A/Se deviation of
more than +10kt. or -5 kt."
At DFDR second 305 the speed fell to
124.78 kts. which was about 7 kts.less
than target approach speed. Indian
Airlines Operations Manual Chapter III
e•
Page 3.11 para 3.5.4. states "Co-Pilot
shall keep a close and constant watch on
flight instruments and engine parameters
and renore the discrepancies (that will
jeopardise safety) to the Captain who
275

will take appropriate action as per
check list and issue command instructions".
Therefore, CM2 deviated from the Prescribed
procedure.
11 second delay in recognising the
idle open descent mode was however, explained
by Airbus Indus trie to be due to the fact
that he was waiting for CM1 to watch and
recognise 'the change and rectify the de-
fect. It is evident that all this time CM1
was busy in flying the aircraft. Even he
did not check the flight parameters includ-
ing the aircraft speed which was falling
down fast due to idle thrust.
(9) There might be another reason for the
calmness in the cockpit from DFDR second
294 to 305. Prior to DFDR second 222 the
aircraft was descending towards MDA with
a vertical speed of 1000 ft/min. At
second 292 the alt. star came in the FMA
and at second 294 CM1 asked for 700 ft/min.
rate of descent. CM2 realised that go
around altitude was not set and so he
started selecting 6000 feet when ATC
transmitted weather information super-
imposing CM2's voice. In this process
the alt.star.phase escaped CM2l s notice
since the moment he rotated altitude knob
the words "Alt.star" got erased from the
FMA. At the same time 1000 ft/min.which
was showing up in the V/S window of FCU
changed to "dashed" indicating that the
276

V/S was being "managed" by FMGC. At
this CM2 got perplexed, immediately
reversed the altitude knob by instinct
and started figuring out how V/S changed
to be managed. This thought kept him
busy and could be the reason for his
calmness till he realised from F1A at
the aircraft had gone
305 second that
and said "you
into idle open descent
are descending on idle open descent ha,
all this time".
Because of -1000 ft/min.rate.of
(9A)
descent selection, the aircraft was
already in speed .mode from DFDR 247
second i.e., A/T (Auto Thrust) speed
select parameter was 1. At 292 second
Alt. star mode started (by flight discrete
5 page 3) and lasted for 2 seconds. So
parameter remained as.
A/T speed select
1 from 292 to 294 seconds. At 294
second if -700 ft/min.had been selected
this parameter would have remained at 1,
whereas from DFDR we can see that at
295 second, this parameter changed from
1 to 0. This confirms that A/T changed
from speed to thrust mode at 295 second.
This may be due to either higher altitude
selection with fixed idle power. From
DFDR, it will be seen APR command, EPR
actual, Fuel flow, N2 increased from
277

294 second continuously upto 1.02 FPR
and thereafter decreasing gradually to
idle power 0.98 FPR.
A doubt may arise why EPR command
increased from-290 second before alt.star
came. It is because the aircraft was
already in speed mode and therefore FPR
command will increase to maintain the
selected aircraft 'speed i.e., 132 kts.
From 288 second aircraft speed reduced
from 140.78 kts. to 137.28 ktse and
then to 135.78 kts. To avoid the aircraft
speed going below selected speed, FPR
command increased at 290 second. Immedi-
ately at 291 second the speed increased
to 136.03 kts. In the meantime the pitch
of the aircraft was gradually increasing
from 290 second. This Washed away increase
in aircraft speed and speed was again
coming down from 292 second. This continued
till 294 second when speed mode changed
to thrust mode. Since higher alt.'w'as selected

continued
to
increase. But because pitch altitude

During this period (secondS 294, to

checked midway (at EPR command 1.02) and
again came down gradually 'from 302 second
to idle thrust command at 308 second.
NOTE:-
A reference EPR is computed by
the EEC as a function of: Thrust lever
angle (TLA), ambient temperature (Tamb),
air inlet temperature (T2), altitude,
Mach number and service bleed. The
current EPR is then compared to the
reference EPR_and corrections are applied
to the fuel_floW in-order to minimise the
difference EPR ref-EPR: (FCOM
Chapter 1.18.30 page 1).
EPR Command is also computed by EEC
using:- EPR Target coming from FMGC to
EEC or directly from TLA (Thrust Lever
Angle). This command is transmitted
279

through DMC, then FDIU and then to DFDR.

441.0377/90, dated 12.4.90).
A comparison of the figures of MDR
value obtained from a different flight,
in the present case cannot give a correct
picture; the flight and ambient conditions
will be different. Further, those figures
were not placed at the time of the investi-
gation before the expert witnesses and
these explanations were not sought.
STATUS OF FLIGHT DIRECTORS:
(10)(cid:9) After' recognising and telling CN1
about idle open descent at DFDR second
308 CI.12 advised CH1 "you want FD' s off
now". Obviously he was thinking of chang-
ing the idle open descent mode to speed
mode again and •he was aware that if AP'is
and night Directors are off the mode
automatically changes to speed mode.
Since AP' s were already off, he wanted
to put off the FD's now to rectify the
situation. Next second CM1 put off his
own flight director and intimated that
he complied with the ,requirement. It
may he stated here that Capt.Guyot in his
deposition in page 36 stated. that CNl was
wrong as normally he would have asked CM2
280

to switch off both FDs. The CM2 was
the PNF, it wa3 his task to have
switched off both FDs. < Further, in
FCOM chapter 3.02.01 page 3 it has
been stated that "procedures willbe_
initiated on CM1 command. PNF -
Pilot-non-flying is responsible for
execution of required action or request
for execution by PY, it applicable".
Capt.Guyot's views were not contested
by anybody. In this case CM2, .instead
.of putting off both FDs merely asked
CH1. At DFDR second '212 CM2 told CM1
"But you did not put off mine". It appears
that even after saying that CM2 still did
not put off his own (CM2) FD as revealed
by the DFDR parameters. "This is against
FCOM procedure detailed in chapter 3.04.11
page 67 "under visual approach with FPV".
It states:-
"At start of approach:
FD1 FD2(cid:9) OFF".
On the issue of.FD1 putting off and
FD2 remaining ON many questions were
raised by various Counsel and the court
wanted full details of connected DFDR
discretes viz., ”Fqc-1 bus used", uFMGC
used FD mode" and "FD Off" - Capt.Guyot
281

explained these discretes in page 2,
36, 37 and 75 of his deposition.
Capt.Gordon.Corps in his deposition in
page 101 agreed to provide full details
in. this regard.. In this connection,
Airbus Industrie sent a letter No.AI/E
fs 420.0212/90, dated 19.9.90 for:•rarding
a technical note No.AI/EE-A-441.0706/90,
dated 7.8.90 on the subject of "A320
IAC - Bangalore EIS information, displayed
on PFDI".
Maintenance Manual chapter 22-10-00
page 39/40 also deals with the same sub-
ject. From all these informations it is
underStood that if FD1 is switched off
"Fla. bus used" which is actually called
"FGC1 bus used for FMA" will no more pro-
vide FD1 information in the FMA of PPM
i.e., the word FD1 will be. removed from
PFD1 when bit status is 0. But if FD1
fails DMC1 will gather the information
from FGC2 bus (from FMGC2) and FD2 will
be Presented in the FMA of PFD1.
Discrete "FMGC used for FD mode" which
is actually "FGCl bus used for FD"
relates to FD order displayed on PFD.
If FDI is switched off FD1 orders will
not be displayed on PFD1 i.e., command
bars of FD1 will be removed when bit
status in 0. But if FD1 fails, DMC1
2
2R

will pickup the information from FGC2
bus (of FMGC2) and display it to PFD1.
In other words, FD2 commands will be
displayed in PFD1. Bit status 1 of
discrete "FDs off" indicates dual
failure of FDs and bit status 0 means
FD1 or FD2 is displayed on PFD1 or FD1
is selected off. Therefore, this dis-,
crete does not definitely indicate
whether FD1 or FD2 was being displayed
on PFD1 or FD1 was switched off. But
since bit status was not 1 it is true that
there was no dual FD failure. Since the
auto-thrust did - not change to speed mode;
by inference, it is to be concluded that
at least on FD remained ON. Since it is
known from CVR that CM1 switched off the
FD1, therefore it has to be concluded
that FD2 remained on. Status of all the
above three discretes, therefore, indi-
cate that FD1 word was no more displayed
in FHA of PFD1, command bars of PFD1
were removed and FD2 remained ON. It maY
be stated here that discrete, "FGCI bus
used for FMA or FGC1 bus used for FD2"
going from 1 to 0 does not mean at all
that the computors were no more electri-
cally supplied. This does not mean eithbr
that the data bus failed or becomes dis-
connected.4
283

A question may arise in this connec-
tion that CM2 might have pressed the FD2
button on .FCU to switch off his F.D. But
it did not work for some reason or the
other and FD2 continued to remain ON.
It can be said against this argument
that whenever any. person takes any action
to achieve something, he always looks for
the result of his action. In this case
light on FD2 push button and display on
FMA and command bars on PFD2 would' have
given him indication whether FD2 was
OFF or not. Further A/thrust mode change
from idle to speed in the FMA would also
indicate if FD2 was OFF or not. 73ut
nothing was commented by CM2 at this time
about malfunction of the push button as
revealed by CVR and the.aircraft continued
to be in idle open descent. Thus the
alternative action left to him now to
come out of this situation was to dis-
connect auto thrust and take over manual
control• of thrust, which he did not. This
action at this time also would have pre-
vented the accident.
(12)(cid:9) It is considered pertinent to refer
to FCOM Bulletin No.2 dated April 1089
page 3 of 3 in this connection. It states:
284

"B.Speed hold in Visual Approach"
To cope with the previous mentioned point
visual approach is analysed. It is re-
called that the visual approach is des-
cribed in FCOM Vol.-3 Chapter 'Procedures
and Techniques" FMGS Part. The described
-procedure recommends that both FD must be
switched off. This causes the A/Thrust
(if kept active) to be in speed mode
(Thus preventing the crew from decreasing
his speed inadvertantly)". It'also states
"If it is intended to maintain the FDs,
two possibilities are offered.
(cid:9) A/thrust is switched off: In this
case thrust is manually adjusted to hold the
desired speed (selected or managed).
(cid:9) :A/thrust is kept active: In this
case it is recommended to use V/S on FPA
mode which causes A/thrust,to be in speed
mode. The flight path is followed with
the pitch tendance (either horizontal FD
bar or altitude director bar) which may
be adjusted with V/S-TPA knob on FCU".
Perusal of the approach procedures
followed by the Pilots of VT-EPNI will
reveal that the pilots were following
none of the procedures as stated in
285

above FCOM bulletin No.2. It is clear
that they did not put off both FDs, as
required by visual approach procedure in
Chapter 3.04.11 page 67 Rev.11. They
did not switch off A/thrust and took
over manual thrust control; nor did they
select vertical speed.
Reduction of Speed and increase of rate
of descent:
(13)(cid:9) At DFDR second 312 the speed reduced
to 121.03 kts.and the aircraft came down
to 232 ft.AGL (Radio altimeter). Even
at this stage the speed was not monitored
by any of the pilots as required by the
check list stated earlier and CM2 did not
call out the speed, which was less than
the target approach speed of 1:13 kts.by
more than 10 kts.
Capt.Guyot was questioned by ICPA
Counsel to explain how the speed was
falling and the rate of descent increased.
He explained It in his deposition (pages
55 and 56). He (laid that when the pitch
attitude was increasing by CM1 sidestick
input, angle of attack was also increasing
to an extent till it vas limited by alpha
protection of flight control laws which
prevented the aircraft to stall. When
286

angle of attack increased, drag force also
increased and became very high, since
engine power was low (idle) speed had to
fall and consequently, the aircraft had
to sink further.
Capt.Guyot's explanation is in con-
formity with the contents of Chapter 7.
"TAKE OFF AND LANDING HIGH SINK RATE ON
THE APPROACH"in Page 171 & 172 of the
authoritative book "Handling the Big Jet"
by Capt.D.P.Davies published by the Civil
Aviation Authority, U.K. He highlighted
three important points among others in
respect of jet aircraft:
(1)P oor acceleration time of jet engine
from low WM.
(2)I ncreased momentum of jet aircraft
making sudden change in flight path
impossible, and
(3)D rag increases faSter than lift pro-
ducing high sink .rate at low speed.
To arrest sink rate he suggested two ways:
1. ay-increasing incidence (angle of attack)-
hut only if air speed and sink rate are
otherwise acceptable. In this case the
thrust must be increased to counter the
287

drag from extra incidence or the
resulting sink rate will be higher.
2. By increasing air speed. This can
be done by increasing thrust. A heavy
aircraft takes a lot of acceleration,
so when this option is exercised a lot
of thrust will be needed.
(14)(cid:9) In this' particular case the thrust was
fixed at idle (low)and speed was low, so
by increasing the angle of attack the drag,
which increased at a faster rate, was not
counteracted by augmentation of thrust and
hence the speed fell down and rate of descent
increased further. Thus efforts of CM1
to Pitch up the aircraft to bring it up to
the normal flight path by increasing angle
of attack at idle thrust deteriorated the
situation. In this connection, the comments
of Inspector of Accident in Page 53 and 54
are very pertinent. "The DFDR data clearly
shows that at this stage, nose of the air-
craft was being pitched up, and its speed
was steadily falling below 130 kts. The
nose .up change of the pitch angle was
probably as a direct result of the sidestick
input being given by Capt. Fernandez to keep
the aircraft in profile but as the engines
were maintaining only idle power due to
open descent mode, the speed of the air-
craft was being washed away and the
288

aircraft started coming below the profile
required for a normal landing".
(15)(cid:9) At DFDR second 315 'Radio altimeter
call out "Two Hundred" was announced.
This was the time when the pilots should have
acted fast without wasting time. After
a gap of 7 seconds the CM2 asked MI at
DFDR second 319 "you are on A.P.still?fl
To explain the silence of 7 seconds at
this stage Airbus Industrie felt that
CM2 was still testing CM1 to recognise the
reason for idle open descent. If it is
presumed that due to some reason FD2 did
not go off inspite .of CM2's efforts to
put it off and CM2 was busy in investi-
gating.the reason for the last 7 seconds
and that is why he wanted to know if the
A.P. was still on, then it has to be
commented that below 2Inn feet AGL there
was no time to be lost in investigation.
It was the time for the check pilot to act
and to take over control of the aircraft
which was steadily losing speed and height
unmonitored and to apply TOGA power manually
by deactivating A/thrust keeping in view
the high downward momentum of the aircraft
and slow acceleration response of jet
engine. Had CM2 applied TOGA power at
289

this time manually the aircraft could
have been saved.
(16)(cid:9) A question has been raised by the
Court as per OFS No.37/3 dated April, 128P
where malfunction of FMGC has been des-
cribed. A theory was put up that at
approximately 294 to 296 seconds if such
a failure occurred resulting in wrong
gross weight information in ECAM whiCh cotsl
have given the pictorial data of V-app.,
VL3, V Alpha max well below -the actual
speed of the aircraft and this could be th,
reason why both highly experienced pilots
did not consider the aircraft to be below
the minimum required speed. This explainn
the .total calm atmosphere in the cockpit
till the phrase "Hey, we are going dbwn"
was uttered by CM1. at DFDR second 322.
Capt.Gordon Corps in his deposition
in page 99 and 100 considered this as a
highly improbable scenario since two indo
pendent channels of calculation could not
have same failure of the same magnitude
at the same time. Secondly, other items
that depend on this information of FMGC
like onset Alpha-floor, Alpha-prot, etc.
operating at the nominal value did not
support failure of both FMGC. However,
he agreed to provide detailed informatiol
later. Accordingly, Airbus Inanstrio
290

letter No.AI/E-fs 420.0211/90, dated
19.9.90 explaining this aspect.
Gross weight and C.G.are computed by
FMGC on the basis of data entered by the
pilot before take off and displayed in lower
ECAM. But from the time 10 seconds after
lift off until CAS=255 kts. or altitude-
15000 feet till the aircraft stops on
ground, weight of the aircraft is inde-
pendently computed by FAC aerodynamically
from informations of angle of .attack, actual
aircraft speed, altitude, mach, slat/flap
Position. C.G. is also independently
computed by FAC which, is a function of
stabilizer position, elevator position,
actual aircraft speed, altitude and FAC
computed weight. VLS is computed by FAC
from FAC weight, FAC C.G. and slat/flap
position. Similarly, V-Alpha-prot and
V-tilpha-max are also computed by FAC in
slat out configuration from angle of
attack, actual airspeed and slat/flap
pos ition. The'DFDR traces show that inci-
dence (angle of attack) and speed measure-
ments obtained from ADTRS-1 were accurate.
This ascertains that IASI VLS, V-Alpha-
prot and V-Alpha-max were correctly dis-
played on PFD-1 which was independent of •
291

FMGC functioning.
It has been concluded by Airbus
Industrie that on PFD the following are
presented:
1.(a) Actual airspeed coming from corres-
ponding ADIRS.
(b) VLS, V-Alpha-prot & V-Alpha-max
computed by associated FAG
V-app computed by associated FMGC.
2. On NMI the V-ref and V-app computed
by FMGC. This (a) and (b) are inde-
pendent of FMGC Danctioning.
The above information is already given in
FCOM bulletin No.1 dated February, 1989.
(17)(cid:9) Therefore, improbability of the
hypthetical FMGC failure can be rejected
on the following reasons:
FNGCs was correctly functioning before
(1)
294/296 DFDR second as the target
approach speed of 132 kts.computed by
FMGC and indicated by magenta triangle
was confirmed by both pilots earlier.
(2) If FMGC 1 fails, FMGC 2 takes over
immediately without changing the speed
indications computed by FMGC.
(?) Failure of two in,: ondent WGCs at
292

the same time to give a wrong indi-
cation of same amount is highly impro-
bable.
(4) Even if both FMGCs fail at the same
time, VLS information computed Inde-
pendently by FAC will be still correct
and available (In DFDR flight discrete
8 page, it is shown that FAC 1 never
failed). As per FCOM Vol.3 Chapter 4
Page 2 Rev.11 V-app = VLS + 5 kt +
wing correction. Therefore, even if
V-•Lpp figure is wrong due to both
FMGC failure (actually in case of
both FMGC failure V-app figure will
disappear) pilots are taught and
supposed .to know that V-app can. never
be less thafi VLS + 5 kt. In other
words, the actual aircraft speed should
always be 5 kts. above VLS speed.
Imnlications of both FMGC failure
As a mater of fact, to understand the
implications of both FMGC failure it
to be recalled that FMGC covers several
functions:
(a) Flight Management which is mainly navl
gation including display in the NDs.
(b) Autopilot
(c) Flight Directors
(d) Autothrust.
293

ai) In case of both FMGC failure there
will be no more navigation display on
the Mls. But DFDR shows that CM1's
MD selection was arc mode/iD NM range.
CM1 or CM2 did not comment on loss of
such display.
aii) On both PFD V-app will no-longer be
displayed but CM1 or CM2 did not
comment on this.

(5)F urther, flight manual requirement of
approach and landing speeds which is
binding by Aircraft Rules is specified
in page 5.06.00 page 2 dated 20.4.1989
as follows: "Approach speed is atleas.t
1.23 V-slg"(cid:9) "Approach speed upto 1.41
V-slg is permitted". On the day of
accident at Bangalore during the acci-
dent V-slg works out to 104 kts. in
landing configuration at-3000 feet
AGL. Therefore minimum approach speed
works out to 127.92 kts.
(6) That the FMGC was working satisfactorily
after DFDR second 294-296 was indicated
by correctly triggering of alpha prot
and alpha floor, IPR command increase
after activation of Alpha floor, etc.
(7) There was no comment of nilots regard-
ing wrong V-app indication comruted
by FMGC and displayed on speed scale
of PFD.
(8) The hypothesis of FMGC failure giving
wrong indication of gross weight can
only shift the V-app in the speed scale
to a lower value.
(9) Actual aircraft speed computed by
ADIR3 was correct.
295

Aircraft speed information in PFD
speed scale was correct:
(18)(cid:9) Aircraft speed is computed by three
independent Air rata Computers incorpora-
ted in three ADI}U (Air Data and Inertial
Reference Unit). In normal condition,
Air Data Computer 1 (ADR 1 - Air Data
Reference No.1) supplies speed information
to Pilot' PFD and ADR 2 supplies the same
to co-pilots PFD. If any one of these
fails (known by ECAM warning "ADR 1 or
ADR 2 fault"), standby ADR 3 can be
transferred to the faulty side by the Air
Data transfer switch. This switch has
three positions - Normal, Captain and
F.O. If Captain's (CM11 s) side ADR 1
fails, this switch should be transferred
to "Captain position so that, the ADR 3
will supply speed information to pilot's
PFD. In this connection, reference may
be made to FCOM 701.1 Chapter 1.1(3.01 Page
1 and P and FCOM vo1.:3 Chapter 3.02.16
Page 2. Rut from the crash site investi-
gation it has been found that Air Data
transfer switch was in normal position.
This confirms that none of the ADR 1 or
AIM 2 fails.
Further, following an ADR failure,
296

if there is a speed disagree between
two remaining ADIls, flight control
alternate law becomes active and protections
are lost. FCOM Vol.3 Chapter 3.02.16 Page
/ may please be referred to. In that case
Air speed has, to be cross checked and
faulty ADR has to be identified by checking
air speed information with standby (con-
ventional) air speed indicator. The faulty
ADR is'to be put off. In alternate laV
"cricket" sound and "stall" synthetic voice
message would have come in. the CVR as the
angle of attack was increased toward's the
stalling angle in this particular case, vide
FCOM Vol.' Chapter 1.09.10 Page 13. Further,
in case double ATM failure, auto thrust
would have been lost recording a "chime"
in the CVR which was not so.
Therefore, it is confirmed that
neither there was a single ADR failure
nor double ADR failure.
Therefore, reason for the calmness
in the cockpit for not doubting the so
called incorrect aircraft speed is not
sustainable. The fact remains that the
aircraft speed was not monitored and the
fall of speed was not announced by CT42
as rewired.
FCOM Vol.1 Chapter 1.16.10 Page n.
297

states that in case of a single ADR
failure also a single chime would have
come and recorded in the CVR which, in
this case has not happened.
TRIGGERING' OF ALPHA FLOOR.
(19)(cid:9) At DFDR second 322 CMI realised that
he would not be able to continue the flight
and make a landing on the runway 09. He
said "Hey, we are going down", at that
time aircraft speed was 108.78, kts. and
aircraft height was 136 feet AGL. In
this connection, first two paras of page
3 of 3 of FCOM bulletin No.2 dated April,
1989 is quoted below:
"Further more, and this must be
underlined, each time AP/FD acquires or
holds SPD/MACH on the pitch axis (via
the elevator) the A/THR is engaged in
thrust mode. Thrust is fixed (max climb
or idle) and cannot vary. In open descent
for example, with A/thrust active thrust
is idle and fixed to idle.
If the FD orders which show the way
to keep the requireo speed, were not
followed, then clue to the fixed idle thrust,
speed might ,decrease upto Alpha-floor
activation'. This remark particularly
298

applies in visual approach (with A/T
engaged) where the FD orders may not
be followed (in order to adjust the
flight path) thus leading to a speed
-floor activation.
decrease upto Alpha
This is exactly what happened in
this particular case. From about -DM
second 295 onwards the aircraft was falling
bolo's,/ the normal flight path. The speed
started falling and aircraft was coming
below the flight profile. CM1.was trying
to maintain the flight profile with the
.
help of elevator to increase angle, of
attack. But as explained earlier the speed
was steadily falling and ultimately at
DFDR second 323.1 Alpha-floor was triggered
as the aircraft already entered in the
alpha-protection zone at DFDR second 319
and the CM2 pulled his sidestick more than
may be stated in this connection

It is also active when sidestick is

more than 14° nose up and if pitch

attitude is greater than 25° or if
the angle of attack protection is
active.
It is the fourth condition that had tri-
ggered the alpha floor function. It is
pertinent to mention here that when CM1
was struggling to pitch up the nose of
the•airctaft to come upto the normal flight
path as he was falling below, the aircraft
entered the. alpha protection zone (stall
protection) and with side-stick pull
beyond 14° operated Alpha-floor trigger-
ing as per specification of the aircraft.
This stall protection and alpha floor
activation does not appear to have been
invoked by the pilot; these protections
came on their own on meeting the stipulated
conditions.
It is further stated that there is
a delay between triggering of Alpha-floor
fUnction and activation of Alpha-floor pro-
tection due to channelling of the signal
through a number of computers. Capt.Guyot
confirmed in his deposition in page 77 that
Airbus Industrie was aware that there was
a delay but only on raising queries they
conducted detailed investigation and inform
vide letter '!%To.AI/E14:-A-441.0378/90 dated
300

12.4.1990 that the delay could be 0.758
second min. and 1.203 seconds max. For
practical purposes it was suggested that
a delay of 0.8 second could be accepted.
It is pertinent to mention that this delay
of 0.8 second was not published earlier in
any of the aircraft document supplied to
the operator.
(20)(cid:9) Therefore, at DFDR second 323.1 the
Alpha-floor protection was triggered and
acGivated at 323.9. The engines normally
started spooling up as required. At that
time Radio altitude was 110 feet AGL and
speed was 106.53 kts. which was min. in
the DFDR recording. It may be stated that
the triggering of Alpha-floor function is
inhibited below 100 feet radio altitude.
301

rUZURT'S OP 1111-567
(1)(cid:9) The day was clear, cloudless and sunny.
From a height of 300 feet, the pilots could
have seen the Amway being far ahead of the
plane's location. Atteast when call out of
200 feet radio altitude was heard, the pilots
could have seen that the plane was nrematurelY
going down.
(2)(cid:9) Situation at this crucial second
(about TF.318) was:-
(1) plane was in idle open descend mode;
(ii) FD.1 was off:
(iii) CM.2 thinks either FD.2 was on, or
if it has been put off, auto pilot
was on and this has caused confusion
in his mind;
(iv) plane was already at an altitude of
200 feet above the ground;
(v) speed was falling; and
(vi) if thrust levers had been pushed, the
engines would develop power in 8 se-
conds which would have given speed to
take un the plane and landing would
have been postponed and thus crash
would not have occurred.
(3)(cid:9) There is a 'chime' recorded. Its timing
is stated to be at 326.5 seconds (revised as
327.3 seconds by the two Assessors); Airbus
Industrie attributesidisconnecting of auto
302

throttle by the pilots using the disconnect but-
tons, to this sound. It is unnecessary to
examine this question, as the plane was by that
time at a situation wherein the fate of the
plane could not have been altered by any human
power.
(4) As a Court of investigation, I have to
express an opinion about the basic cause for
the crash. The crucial period commenced roughly
at about 293 seconds, when CM.1 asked for 700
feet rote of descend. The entire period ending
with the crash could. be divided
into three stages. The first stage is between
the time when 700 feet rate of descend was asked
and the time when CM.2 spoke the words "you are
descending on idle open descend ha, all this
time." The second stage is between the words
"you want the FDs off now" till RA call out of
200 - i.e., between TF.307 to 315. The third
stage commences with the words "you are at the
auto pilot still ?" This timing given as 319
seconds was revised as 319.3 seconds by CASB,
which the two Assessors have taken at 320.7
seconds. During this time-frame plane had
moved into the death trap at 321 seconds and no
action by the pilots would have saved it.
(5) The cause for the crash has to be seen
in the first two stages.
(6)(cid:9) A few alternative possibilities, can be
303

thought of, during the first stage. They are:-
(i)C M.2 selected the vertical speed of
700 feet rate of descend as requested by CM.1,
without noticing the Alt*; hence selection
became otiose.
(ii)C M.2 thought of, first complying with
the earlier request of CM.1 for "go around alti-
tude" and therefore stretched his hand to dial
the altitude knob, but while doing so; was guided
by the just spoken words of CM.1 and thus, by
mistake dialed for 700 feet (instead of 6000
feet of altitude). This resulted in the plane
adonting the idle open descend mode.
(iii)C M.2 wanted to select the vertical
speed of 700 feet but committed the mistake of
selecting the wrong knob (as happened to several
pilotg, including Capt. Therogaonkarl.
(iv) Even though CM.2 saw the Alt*, while
selecting the vertical speed, he did not resort
to the required procedure, of dialing and null-
ing the sneed knob.
(v)C M.2 had his own ideas and therefore
did not select the vertical sneed„ nor go
around altitude.
(vi) C11.2 selected the "go around" altitude
which resulted in the plane climbing un and so
immediately by a "fiick" of the wrist, reversed
304

the knob, without realising, that while revers-
ing, a low altitude got selected.
(vii) A complete failure of the systems in
the aircraft - for this, I do not find any evi-
dence whatsoever. The plane reacted to the side
stick movements and the pushing of the throttle
levers within a few seconds. Hence this possi-
bility has to be ruled out.
(viii) The probabilities were, CM.1 did some-
thing which he never imagined as a wrong one
and was quite certain of his action. If he
stretched his arm to select the correct knob, but
while acting on the knob, mechanically selected
the wrong figure, he may not notice it and he
will be sure of his action.
(7) If CM.2 had proceeded to select "go
around" altitude while sneaking the words
"missed approach", the plane would have started
climbing up. The theory of Airbus Industrie
is, CM.2 selected "go around altitude" and imme-
diately realised that plane was climbing UD
and therefore reversed the selection of alti-
tude by a wrist flick resulting in selecting a
very low altitude, which he failed to notice,
which in turn resulted in the plane going into
'idle open descent . For this theory, Airbus
Industrie refers to pFDR readings. This is ela-
borately discussed under two rival sets of
views.
(8) This theory assumes that CM.2 selected a
305

higher altitude at about TF.294 and immediately
reversed it. If so, he must be aware of the
action taken by him. He cannot be surprised by
the idle open descend mode of the plane; Capt.
Gopujkar (CM.2) attributes the 'idle open descend
mode' to CM.1, by saying to CM.1 "you are dascend-
ing on idle open descent BIALLA.2I1.2_tIBLL". If
CM.2 had selected a higher altitude and then
reversed it, without realising that reversal
resulted in the selection of a lower altitude,
his expression would have been quite different,
something like "oh: this is on idle open des-
cend, Why 7" When CM.2 uses the phrase "aell
this time", it is clear that according to CM.2,
plane was in idle open descend mode for a long
time. At any rate, he would immediately realise
that his action in selecting the altitude by
turning the knob by flicking the wrist must
have caused some change in the plane's mode
and therefore he would hawk_ checked the alti-
tude selection once agaih. It is not possible
for me to infer that Capt. Gopujkar, if he had
actually dialed any one of the knobs and then
reversed it, would have failed to examine the
effect of it after realising that plane was
in idle open descend mode.
(9)(cid:9) The hump theory (same as the wrist
flick theory) propounded by the Airbus Industrie
does not explain one more factor. CM.1 asked
for 700 feet rate of descent at about 294
306

from 0,98 to 1.00 at 290 seconds and bectime
1.01 at 294 seconds, and then got increased to
1.02 at 298 seconds till 300 seconds and then
reduced to 1.01 at 301 seconds and at 303
seconds came close to 1.00 and at 306 seconds
became 0.99. The EPR actuals correspondingly
changed later, but never got below 1.00 at any
time thereafter. The suggestion implicit in
the 'hump theory' was that CM.2 selected higher
altitude after CM.1 spoke the above words, and
the selection was made by CM.2 while talking
"missed annroach is...". This can only be after
294 seconds; may be at about 295 seconds, by
which time, already EPR command value had
started going up at 290 seconds.
(10) The witnesses examined by the Airbus
Industrie have not explained the circumstances
under which normal increase in EPR value would
go up from idle (i.e., from 0.98), as happened
earlier also at 248 seconds. In fact, Cant.
Guyot and Ctipt. Corns, the two main witnesses
examined by Airbus Industrie were not able to
explain many aspects of this aircraft; when
questioned, they repeatedly replied that they
would send the reply after getting an answer
from the 'design office'.
(11) As, this hum theory is propounded by
the Airbus Industrie, it is for this participant

proper technological reasons before the Court.
The recording of oral evidence was concluded ,on
9-8-A990. For the prevaration of the arguments,
several Advocates requested time; the Counsel
for Airbus Industrie, at that time onposed the
move to adjourn the proceedings for arguments
for more than two weeks. However, having regard
to the questions involved and the vast material
on record, Court 'proceedings were adjourned to
17th September, 1990. Written arguments were
to be filed by 12th September 1990; thus parti-
cipants had over four weeks to prepare and file
written submissions. On 12th September 1990
the counsel for the Airbus Industrie came up
with a request for another six weeks to file
written arguments,whicb I declined to grant.
When the Court assembled on 17th September, 1990
A-irbus Industrie filed its written submissions,
whicil is not exhaustive of the facts, and there
has been a complete go-by to the analysis of
the material on record. On the same day oral
arguments commenced. The written submissions
filed by the Airbus Industrie disclose only,
its defensive attitude.
(12)(cid:9) In the written arguments filed,
it is stated that Airbus Industrie had no
access to several exhibits filed in the
Court. This is incorrect and is an unfair
308

statement. At the very beginning, participants
were told to look into the exhibits at any time
and the Secretary of the Court was instructed
to permit the participants/their Advocates to
inspect the documents and wherever possible
copies sought for were furnished. A substantial
number of exhibits were the publications of
Airbus Industrie or of Aeroformation.
(13)(cid:9) If 'I am to apply technical rules of
eviden-ze, on many of the contested issues, I
have to draw adverse inference against, the
stand taken by the Airbus Industrie. It failed
to cmzs-examine most of the witnesses who smoke
about the functioning of the systems of this
aircraft and other subjects such as, activation
of Alpha floor protection and selection of
vertical speed during Alt* phase. The witnesses
examined by Airbus Industrie were ignorant of
many aspects pertaining to this aircraft and
diversionary answers were given by these wit-
nesses (Capt. Guyot and Cant. Corns). On many
questions, left unanswered by its witnesses,
answers were sent after the arguments were over.
Other participants had no occasion to read
these answers and test them for their correct-
ness,. Airbus Industrie seems to have treated
the Court proceedings as if it is a private
investigation, ignoring the provisions of Rule
75(2) of the Aircraft Rules, 1937.
309

(14)(cid:9) Another probability is that CM.2 dialed
the wrong knob (thinking that he dialed the
correct knob) resulting in the selection of a
lower altitude (a possibility spoken to by
Capt. Thergeonkar)(cid:9) It is also, probable, that
he wanted to select go around altitude first
and therefore selected the altitude knob, but,
while dialing it, the words just told to him
by CM.2 regarding, vertical speed, influenced
his action and thus he selected 'the altitude
of 700 feet without even realising that he
selected the wrong altitude. There are occa-
sions when an action taken with a particular
object in view, gets confused because of another
object influencing it. If CM.2 had acted at
TF.294 to dial V/S knob at a time when plane
was in Alt* zone, he might have failed to
follow the requisite procedure. This is also
quite probable because having thought that he
selected the vertical sreed of 700 feet at the
most appropriate time, he was surnrised to find
the plane in idle/open descent mode a few
seconds later and therefore he expressed to
CM.1, by stating "you are descending on idle
open descend aa, all this time".
(15)(cid:9) CM2 (Capt. Gonujkar) certainly knew that
while at landing apnroach, idle open descend mode
was not proper. Alt* phase continued throughout
TF.294. If CM.2 had dialed the speed knob without
310

the appropriate steps applicable to Alt* phase/
as stated above, it will be a futile exercise.
THE SECOND STAGS:
(16)(cid:9) At TF.305, CM.2 spoke the words "you
are descending on idle open descend(cid:9) all this
time". Just nrior to that there was RA call
out of 300. The call out occurred in the course
of CM.2 telling "you are descending..." When
call out of the radio altitude is 300 (for three
hundred feet) and the plane is found to be in
idle open descend mode, the instinctive reaction
of the exngrienced pilots ought to have been to
accelerate power, unless they were certain of
the safety of the plane in spite of its situa-
tion. Cent. Gopujkar asked CM.1 at about TF.
308.9, "you want the FDs off now" -and Capt.
Fernandes responds by saying "ye" and immediately
he (Capt. Fernandes) nuts off his FD because
he says further, "OK, I already put it off".
There can be no doubt that switching off of
the FDs at this point of time also would have
converted the idle open descent mode into speed
mode and in all probability crash would not
have occurred. For about 2 to 3 seconds, CM.2
does not talk, but then says, "but you did not
put off mine". This indicates that CM.2 wanted
CM.1 to nut off both .the FDs. Evidence on
record (both (Aral and documentary) show that it
is the function of Non-Flying Pilot (CM.2) to
put off both the FDs. Here, CM.2 expected CM.1
311

to put off his FD; probably CM.2 thought as
pilot in command he was there to check the
pilot flying (CM.1) and he need not act
strictly as CM.2, or because CM.1 had put off
FD.1, CM.1 also should put off FD.2. It is
not possible to find out any other reason for
CM.2, here, to expect CM.1 to put off the FDs.
This statement is made at TF.312.9 (17 seconds
before the crash) At TF.314 (stated as 316
seconds by the two Assessors. ..7 there was a
call out of radio altitude as 200. At TF.319.8

CM.2 asks CM.1 "you are on the auto
still?" By that time plane must have descended
further down. CM.1 says 'No(cid:9) In fact, it is
admitted by all the participants that auto pilot
was put off far earlier at TF.174 and the sound
was clearly recorded. That was When CM.2 had
told "runway in sight" and after ATC had trans-
mitted the message "605, position 7 miles west,
on left base for R/W 09 check wheels and report
R/W in sight", and CM.1 spoke of "flap 3". Cant.
Gopujkar certainly must have noticed the dis-
connecting of the auto pilots earlier. But the
words he spoke at TF.319.8 indicates that in
snite of FDs being nut off, the panel displayed
the functioning of FD.2. CM.2 had told CM.1
that the latter did not put off former's FD,
after CM.1 had told CM.2 that he had put off
his FD. CM.2 realised that his FD was not put
off. Having realised that CM.1 had not put
312

off FD.2 of CM.2, the normal reaction of CM.2
ought to be to put off FD.2 himself. Therefore,
either he pressed the switch in an attempt to
put off the FD or saw CM.1 pressing the said
switch to put it off by stretching his arm to-
wards FD.2 switch. Thereafter, both the pilots
were certain that FDs were off, but CM.2 found
the panel showing otherwise. This is possible
only if auto pilot was not disconnected; there-
fore CM.2 asks CM.1 whether he was "on the auto
pilot still". (However, if FD.2 is switched
off, there would not be We display of the
letters 'FD.2'). Since auto pilot was disen-
gaged and there is no dispute on that question,
inference is that FD.2 was not off, in spite
of CM.2 or CM.1 pressing the switch to put it
off. Having pressed the.switdh•off, both were
certain that FDs were off, without realiiing
that the act of switching off of the switch
failed to nut off the switch. To nut off the
FD, the switch had to be pressed. It is quite
possible that in the instant case, sufficient
Pressure was not imparted while Pressing the
switch and the pilots did not watch the push
button light, FMA and the vanishing of FD command
bars. It is also probable that the FD.2
switch had failed for some reason and did not
respond to the pressure put on it, to rut off
I'D.2. The query made by CM.2 about the auto
pilot being still on at TF.319 according to
313

me, is indicative of the fact that FD.2 was
still 'on' in spite of an action to put it off.
(17)(cid:9) CM.1 takes about 2 seconds to answer
CM.2 and to say 'No', i.e., to convey that auto
pilot was not 'on'. CM.2 repeats the words
"it is off". This answer indicates that he was
pilot
surprised by the information that auto
was off. He was wondering about the continued
situation in spite of auto pilot and both the
Flight Directors were being 'off'.
(i) I cannot agree with the contention that
FD.2 switch was not at all Dressed. The previ-
ous conversation between the pilots clearly
brings out that they wanted FDs to be off. It
is inconceivable that a person of Cant. Gonujkar's
experience would not have Dressed the FD.2
switch to put the FD.2 to off, after Cant. Fer-
nandez told him that FD.1 was nut off; it is
also inconceivable that Capt. Fernandez would
not have stretched his arm to put the switch
off, after CM.2 enquired of him that his switch
was not nut off by CM.1; one of them certainly
must have pressed the switch, but, for some
reason, it did not go off. The question of
Cant. Gonujkar "are you on the auto DIU:it
still ?" was at about TF.319; by the time CM.1
replied 'No', which was at about TF.321, plane
had entered tt.ie death trap. The revised timing
furnished by CASB sio this answer 'No' is
321.4 seconds; the repetition of the words
314

"it is off" by CM.2 was at about 322 seconds,
and it was too late to retrieve the plane.
Cant. Gupta in his affidavit (which is treated
as Dart of his deposition) clearly stated that
it was a tricky affair to nut off FDs and it is
for the pilot Not Flying to stretch himself to
reach the FD in front of the Pilot Flying.
[Similarly, for CM.1 to put off FD.2, he will
have to stretch himself as could be seen from
7.
its lOcation
(ii)T he DFDR does not provide for record-
ing the FD.2. Cant. Guyot stated that as auto
thrust was remaining in thrust idle mode, FD.2
must be on.
(iii) These switches are not "feather-touch"
sensitive; they require to be Dressed to put them
off.
(iv) After CM.2 told CM.1 that the latter
did not put off former's FD, the next words came
out about 7 seconds later. For 7 seconds, there
was no conversation. Pilots would not have been
idle during these 7 seconds. In all probability,
one of them pressed the FD.2 switch offin the
meanwhile, but the result was confusing. That
is why CM.2 asks CM.1 (after 7 seconds) "you are
on the auto pilot still". The circumstances are.
such that it is impossible for me to conclude
that pilots did not prbss the FD.2 switch; there-
fore the inference has to be that it did not
go off for some reason c- ether.

(18)(cid:9) In the course of ascertaining as to
whether auto pilot was on or off, crucial seconds
were lost. Thrust levers were not pushed at
that moment. It is quite evident that plane
would not have crashed only if any one of the
pilots had pushed the throttles by TF.321.
seconds. At that stage no pilot should pause
to examine and find out the cause for the wrong
displays, if any, or for the cause as to why
the plane wits in idle open descend mode. The
approach profile for landing and the duties of
pilots while landing a plane are explained by
a few witnesses who ore themselves pilots in
A.320 aircraft. But the contributory role
played by the FD.2 switch in this case also cannot
be ignored.
(19)(cid:9) Capt. Thergeonkar pointed out that
whatever mode is selected, - whether of speed
mode, or of idle descend mode - it is displayed
on Flight Mode Annunciator (FMA). The FCU is
quite clear and large. While approaching land-
ing pilots are expected to manage the speed.
The witness added:
"It is true the sneed Alt* referred
against 13.0.1.03 hrs. and the next
one was achieved just above 4600 alti-
tude. Thereafter obviously the FCU
altitude was set for a lower altitude.
The setting of the altitude once again
below 4600 WEIS contrary to the said
316

procedure (cid:9) on the second occasion
i.e., at 13.02:08 hrs, go around of
6000 ft. should have been set, but
was not done; because
apparently it
he was on the vertical speed at that
time the plane would not have climbed
up again by setting -the height at 6000
on the second occasion. Eventhough
there were two deviations from the
procedure referred already I do not
think that it was inevitable. that the
plane should have landed at the Course.
At 3341 height when Alto came again
(about 292 DFDR seconds) the pilot could
have taken action to convert the mode
into speed mode. If at 13.02.42 hrs.
(i.e., 293.294 DFDR seconds), 700 ft.
rate of descent had been selected
'the aircraft would have gone into
speed mode and auto thrust would have
maintained the engine power and thus
aircraft speed. The last 35 seconds
before the crash was the most crucial
stage in the flight. I am quite comma
fortable and always felt comfortable
while flying A.320. I do not think
the aircraft is too sophisticated...4
He also stated that route checks are always
conducted on nessenger flights all over the
world and that is tOe prevailing practice.
317

(20) Cant. Sathye spoke of the need to
scrupulously follow the check list by the
pilots and that plane has to be in the steed
mode at the time of approach; maintenance of
speed is very important at the time of landing.
(21) Capt. Gupta (witness on behalf of ICPA)
said that the normal practice during approach
for the pilots is to maintain the speed and
agreed that in the last 35 seconds to the crash
there is no .reference to speed on the CVR. He
agreed that%as per Ex.78, it is the specific
task of pilot Non-flying to monitor speed and
outside the limits of plus 10
advice if it goes
or minus 5 knotspabove VPP and then said:
"I am surprised myself and after
all my efforts 3 have not been able
the state of mind of Capt.
to judge
e
Gopujkar who was so very meticulous
why he has failed to call the devia-
tion of speed."
A few sentences later, this witness said:
"Possibly the crash could have been
avoided if the deviation of the speed
was pronounced at the time frame of
312."
(22) Capt. Gupta never landed this aircraft
in idle oven descend mode in the course of his
300 flying hours and states that while landing
one has to be in a proper approach profile. An
(cid:9)
318
qrv,A -4)(7

annropriate speed is very important, which is
called V. annroach and that the speed will have
to be monitored by both the pilots. According
to him,--
....if the plane is in the normal
annroach profile, where plane cannot
afford to lose height
.theIhnlligLyila
have to be moved for increasing the speed."
(23) Capt. Bhujwala is another pilot who was
Canto Gopujkar's batch-mate throughout. He
also states that idle open descent is not the
correct mode for approach and it ought to be
sreed mode and that while apnroaching it is
necessary to monitor the speed. He stated:
"If the sneed goes below V.approach
or Majenta triangle the pilot will
have to normally increase the speed
by operating the throttle. This is
necessary for nroner landing of the
aircraft."
(24) Capt. Shresta, though yOung and a
recent trainee also says that "the aircraft
sneed must be maintained at V. approach speed
till you come close to the runway and that speed
will have to be maintained."
(25) It was argued that such a fundanental
and basic requirement of maintaining annroach
sneed would not have been ignored by Capt.Goruj-
Isar and therefore, 'something in the speed
319

indicator must have misled him.
(26) With the frequent announcement of radio
altitude from 400 feet and below, when plane was
found to be in idle open descent mode, the first
reaction ought to have been to resort to the
throttle; obviously Capt. Gopujker was perplexed
by the idle open descend mode and the display
of FD.2; this diverted his mind in not noticing
the speed.
(27) DFDR shows that at 293 seconds, speed
was 134.53 knots. Magenta was set at 132 knots
at TF.96. At TF.296 the speed was 131:78 as per
the DFDR. Speed had fallen to' 130.78 by TF.298.
Therefore, the speed was certainly below magenta
at TF.298 and can it be said that this was not
noticed by anyone of the pilots till CM.1
exclaimeds
"Hey we are going down", which was at
about TF.323(cid:9) At TF.324 speed was 109.78 knots.
By that time about 7 seconds earlier radio alti-
tude call out of 200 had been made. At TF.302
the speed was 127.53 and at 303 seconds it was
126.28; sneed was continuously falling even
thereafter.
(28) Do these indicate that the two experien-
ced r► ilots failed to notice the falling speed ?
Is it likely that both the pilots were in a
confused state of mind and they did not realise
the speed fall ? Or any of the displays misled
them 7
320

(29)(cid:9) Ona more hypothesis has to be referred.
A.320 has an unique system called Alpha Floor
Protection, which essentially protects the
plane from wind shear. By moving the side
sticks, it is possible to trigger Alpha floor
protection; when activated this system activates
the engines and engines' develop full acceleration
in 8 seconds from activation. CM.1 has moved
the side sticks and Alpha floor was triggered
at TF•323.1, and it must have been activated
at TF.323.9° At TF.321, side stick was moved
to-8.89° ; if this was- the action taken by CM.1
in the direction of triggering Alpha floor, it
indicates that CM.1 had realised the gravity of
the situation. If only he did not rely on
Alpha floor system, he would have acted on the
throttles by pushing the levers; if he had
pushed the throttles by TF.321, there was every
chance of this plane surviving the crash because
by TF.329 engines would have developed full
power. Therefore, can it be, that, the pilots
relied on this Alpha floor protection which
delayed their action on .the throttles
(30)(cid:9) Whatever be the probabilities attribu-
table to the pilots, the fact remains that they
saw the plane being in idle open descend mode,
which is not en appropriate mode for descending
at that phase of the flight and the requisite
corrective action was not taken. There may be
many explanations; it may be said that such
321

experienced competent pilot like Cant. Gonujkar
would not have failed to notice the speed and
would not have failed to remember the requisite
action to be taken. It is quite possible that
for some reason the pilots believed the plane
to be in proper sneed and there was no cause
for panic; they must have felt that they can
check the FDs and the auto pilot, before taking
the next step.
If FD.2 is 'on', the FMA in front of
CM.2 would display the letters 'FD.2'; but it
will not be displayed in the FMA of CM.1. If
FD.2 is off and auto pilot is 'on', the FMA in
front of CM.2 would display the words 'A/Pi.
Therefore it is surprising as to why Cant.
Gonujkar asked CM.1 as to whether auto pilot
was 'on'. If FD.2 did not go off and if he had
looked into the FMA in front of "him he should
have questioned as to why FD.2 was still 'on'.
Unless the display system misbehaved, the other
inference could only be 'that Cant. Gonujkar did
not concentrate and did not look into his FMA.
- Some doubt has been cast about this display
system and it has been suggested that the dis-
play system must have misled the nilots, regard-
ing sneed. It was contended that, at this
stage in the absence of the FMA being available
for examination the suggestion made that there
322

must have been wrong display should not be
ignored. The systems in the cockpit are backed
by alternatives. Normally, the reaction of
CN.2 ought-to have been to- floakinto other dis-
pleYs as wellito check and find out Whether
FD.2 was 'on' or not. Similar is the case
with the speed displays.
(31)(cid:9) The two pilots are no more and their
version of the situation has to be inferred
from the various circumstances. All the
various probabilities are on the assumption
that the display systems in the cockpit fun-
ctioned perfectly. In case there were wrong
displays, for whatever reason and the pilots
were misled by such displays, resulting in
their failure to note the speed fall, none
could attribute any error to the actions
taken'by these two pilots. Due to the fire,
these systems are not available for examina-
tion to find out their behaviour during the
early crucial seconds. Just as the manufa-
cturers are proud of their product (the
aircraft) and attribute infallibility to
the display systems, ICPA is certain of the
unimpeachable perfection of the two pilots.
ICPA repeatedly questioned as 6 how it is
possible to infer that the pilots might have
323

committed the mistake of not following the basic
principle of flying, and ignore the speed
Why not attribute the error to the display
systems ?
(32) This is a case where various answers
can be given for each disputed question, as
could be seen from the two sets of rival views
summarised by me already. It is rot possible
to infer what the Oilots must have done during
the first two stages of the crucial seconds.
But, it is possible to say what they should
have done and what a properly trained prudent
airmanship should have prompted them to do.
(33) It is clear that, the pilots failed to
convert the idle open descend mode to speed
when
mode (for whatever reason) even they saw
that the plane was in idle open descend mode
and the'nlane was already in the crucial phase
of landing'. After runway was in sight, short
finals announced and landing checks completed,
nilots diverted their attention to find out the.
reason for the idle open descend mode, rather
than reacting- to the situation by acting on the
throttle levers. Crucial seconds were spent
in checking the FDs and the auto pilots. The
entire crash is the result of what the pilots
did not do between 295 to 320 seconds - during
25 seconds (i.e., less than half a minute) and
not Whet they did.

THE CRASH
(35)(cid:9) At 329.9 seconds there. was the first
touch down. This was with a heavy 'G' force
is the theory putforth by Airbus Industrie and
others. Another theory is, this was a soft
touch down and the next impact with the ground
was quite heavy and the crash sound recorded
pertains to this; therefore, as per this second
theory, crash sounds were recorded at TF.311.4
and that thrust levers were moved between 32/1.0
and S24.Pn. Even then, ft is seen that the. tim,,
lag between these. two points is within
7 seconds.
(n6)(cid:9) The plane impacted the ground at the
golf'course, bounced for about 234 feet and
then impacted the golf course once again;
thereafter, it dragged further for about
100 feet before impacting the embankment. The,
.
325

was no sufficient running ground space avail-
able. It could not fly over the embankment
(which is at about 12 feet height) of the golf
course; the engines impacted against the
embankment and got disassociated from the plane,
resulting in fuel leakage and fire erupted
to consume a few and caused irreparable burn-
ings in others; the forward momentum of the
plane carried it for a While to land the plane
on the marshy land, about 150 feet away from
the airport boundary wall. Examination of the
engines reveled that they were fully active
and almost gained full power by the time the
plane impacted against the embankment.
(37)(cid:9) A discussion on the events during
these crucial seconds leads to one inevitable
conclusion, that, the pilots in spite of notic-
ing the plane in idle open descend mode failed
to rtsct immediately at the final phase of land-
ing; instead, they tried to fihd out the cause
for the idle descend mode and in this they spent
some valuable moments. The continuous functioning
of FD.2 insnite of an attempt to out it off might
have confused them and diverted the attention of
these pilots or, a false sense of security that
this plane is capable of looking after itself,
because of its snecial features like Alnha floor
71rotection might have misled theM.
(37)(cid:9) Discussion on the question of crew training
326

and the peculiarities of Alnha floor nrotection
and Alt* phase would indicate the insufficiency
in the training imparted to the pilots, on these
questions. Reflexes to act in a particular
manner, during an emergency or during unforeseen
situation, can be developed only by intensive
training and forewarning against relying on
systems in the aircraft meant to meet some
other contingency. For example, when pilots
are trained, to pull side stick first and then
use the thrust lever-es back up, at the time
of demOnstrating Alpha floor exercise, the
reflex action also would be the same, when an
action is necessary to increase the thrust,
under adverse conditions. In fact, CM.1 has
resorted exactly to tbr said nrocedure. If he
had been trained to move thrust levers first
and he had pushed them by TF.320 seconds, most
nrobably crash would not have occurred. It is
necessary to repent here that, overemphasis on
the snecial features of this aircraft, such as
envelop nrotection, Alnha floor protection and
that the plane would not stall at alt, must have
created a false sense of security in the pilots
and postponed the realisation of the gravity of
the situation, till about TF. 321 seconds. The
words of CM.1 "you are on the auto pilot still"
almost ended with the time within which the
throttle levers should have been moved. There
was no sense of urgency, or of panic in these
327

words, a factor which indicates complacency with
which the pilots were functioning.
(28) Earlier I have said, while considering
the approach selected by the pilots that there
was no major deviation by following a mixture
of \!0R-DME and visual.
(29) However, a minor deviation may sometimes
contribute to the development of a major dis-
aster. When auto pilot was disconnected earlier
at DFDR seconds 174, if CM or CN2 had called
for switching off the FDs and FDs had been switch-
ed off, the subsequent confusion arising out of
idle descent mode would not have happened.
At least while landing checks were being
done
(between 271 to 275 seconds
or immediately there
after) FDs should have been
switched off. Evi-
dence, no doubt, shows that
landing with FDs l on'
is possible; but that is an
exceptional mode of,
lending. If the FD is used during visual nporoach,
pr ceaare described in last
Para of Page 2 of 1 of
Rulletin No.:!, should be followed. The
"two crew-member philosophy" requires. any action
taken her one Pilot to be monitored by the other.
(40)'(cid:9)
According to Capt.Oupta, the pilot who
ruts off one FD also should put off the other
FD and that CM1 was wrong in not calling for
switching off the FDs and only putting off his
FD. Subsequently, qapt.Gupta deposed that,
328

"Looking into the circumstances he
(Capt. Gopujkar) definitely made an
attempt to switch off the FDs himself
and persistent indications on FRA
created a doubt in his mind whether
auto pilot was'on'or not. All these
actions under these circumstances were
not called for any normal conversations
but, positively for a corrective action,
I fully understand if FDs had not gone
off by his effort Capt. Fernandez's
effort could not have been achieved
anything better and this could hevc
,attributed
The witness (en experienced pilot), 1.410 was the
sole witness for ICPA, further said:
"The normal practice during approach
for the pilots is to monitor the
sneed"
and agreed that during the last 35 seconds to
the crash there is no reference to speed on the
CVR; in the instant case, at DFDR 312 seconds CM.2
ought to have called for the deviation, from
the speed; 'he said -
"Probably the crash could have been
avoided it the deviation of the speed
was prorinced at the time frame of
312".
Capt. Gupta felt that the showing of Alt' centure
mode for AP.2 from time frame P25-235 White for
329

AP.1 it was 225-234, indicates spurious signals
to the DFDR and he attributes spurious signals
at TF.292 to 294 seconds also.
(41) This witness has attributed pressure in
the mind of Capt.Fernandez because ha was under
his first Rodte-Check. Capt. Gupta opined that:
"During the last 6 seconds nothing
could have ,been done to prevent the
crash".
He. reneatedly said of the using of throttles to
maintain speed while landing:
"The speed can be increased either
by moving the throttle or by increas-
ing the rate of descent. In case

most.probably there was no sufficient pressure
put on the switch, or for some reason, switch
did not go off. If C111 had attempted to switch
off FD2, he has to stretch his arm across towards
the switch, unlike the switch of FD1 which is
nearer to his seat and all would not notice whether
the switch had gone off or-not by looking at his
FMA. But this cannot be the real cause for the
crash, becaUse, there was still some time left
for the pilots to resort to manual operation of
the throttles.
(45) Possibility of display systems misleading
the pilots was not highlighted in the evidence
by anyone of the participants.

Possibility of an event having occurred, certainly
has to be investigated, provided such a possi-

The Court cannot act only on the basis of a
mere hypothesis; for example, a remote possibility
of 'black out' of human mind always exists;
frOm this, is it possible for the Court that such
332

a noasibility must have occurred and can I say
that its non-happening has not been established ?
(47) While investigating for the cause of
a crash of this magnitude, no line of investiga-
tion legally suggested should be ignored; these
ideas are to be discussed in the open Court for
consideration. The Court and the Assessors
should
examine only such suggestions dispassionately; in
the absence of prover evidentiary materiel on
record, answers to these questions are to be
deduced from the probabilities of the circum-
stances.
(48) Indian Airlines has examined
severtl
witnesses; some are competent pilots
and a few
engineers also. It was not elicited from any-
one of them the nossibility of wrong displays or
misbehaviour by instruments. No pilot stated
that the speed displays are not conveniently
nlaced fot speed monitoring. Atleast three
pilot witnesses (Cant. Thergaonkar, Cent. Sett
-lye
and Capt. Bhujwala) did not comnlein of any
difficulty in monitoring the sneed while flying
this aircraft.
(49)
In these circumstances, I am constrained
to conclude that material on record is insuffi-
cient to cast any doubt about the functionings
of the cockpit instruments
and their behaviour,
except, regarding the doubt about the sensitiveness
333

of FD2 switch.
(FO)(cid:9) I am of the view that there was an
Unnecessary diversion of attention to check the
cause for the idle/open descent mode of the plane
end the instinctive reaction to resort to the
thrust levers did not come out at the crucial
moment.
(51) It is quite probable that a false sense
of security was created by a wrong understanding
as to some of the systems of the aircraft and
inadequate knowledge of these systems•, which re-
tarded the growth of proper reflexes in the pilots.
(52) A possibility of idle/open descent mode
getting engaged for an unknown reason, as, happened
in the case of 'Delhi 3ird Hit' incidence, has
been referred; such a suggestion was made by a
few participants also. There is no evidence,
here, of- any hard impact against the plane at
TF.2P5 or thereafter (or earlier), till the crash.
(9R)(cid:9) There is nothing to indicate that pilots
were aware of the speed falling; these are two
experienced pilots out of whom one is on his first
route check in this aircraft. The calmness of
cockpit atmosphere indicates that their mind was
elsewhere; if not at the+.t point of time, pilots
should have resorted to manual operation of the
334

throttles, instead of searching for the cause
for the idle/open descent mode. The Check pilot
did not even acknowledge when the pilot under
check (CM1) asked for 700 feet rate of descent;
instead he spoke of "missed approach...."; Why ?
Did the interruption to the talk by the ATC
transmission, interrupted the line of thinking ?
Purpose of the investigation in finding out the
cause and circumstances of the crash, is to
take remedial measures from a practical point
of view, to prevent .recurrence of such an
accident. In the words of Shakespeare:
"Wise men ne er sit and
wail their loss,
Rut cheerlv seek how to redress
(cid:9)
their harms".

PART-V
ENGINES:
5.1 A detailed discussion on the engines is
not called for in this case. Aero Engines
examined 3 witnesses on their behalf. Mr.Pkonald
Weaver is an Accident Investigator at IAE and
he has spoken to the boroscope inspection conducted
by the Deputy Director of Air Safety and others,
when he was present. There was also some questioning
of this witness regarding vertical 'G' fbrce
at the time of the impact. Mr.Graig Bolt is
another witness who is the Manager of Aikworthiness
at IAE. He gave evidence regarding the certification
proceedings and the certificates obtained for
the engines. He was also questioned about the
timing of the first touch down and about the
DFDR readings. There were several questions
regarding N2 and the proposal to improve it.
The last witness was Mr..S under(cid:9) Venktat, who is
a Customer Support Manager at IAE. He is also
highly qualified in technology and other allied
subjects and has gained good experience in the
subjects. He has pointed out that there was
no complaint about V-2500 Aero Engines at any
time by the Indian Airlines.
5.2(cid:9) These three witnesses examined by IAE
were quite forthright in their answers and I do
not find any hesitation in any one of them to
meet any of the problems placed before them at
336

the time of questioning. In this problematic
case, I found unanimity amongst all concerned
about the performance of the engines. Some of
the technical aspects are found in the note whicY
I have appended to this report, separately,
which may have a bearing on further research.
5.3(cid:9) Though DFDR data had indicated a reduced
actual EPR value on left engine during the bounc
between first and second touch downs, strip
examination of 'the engines, type of failure of
LP rotor stub shaft in both engines similar in
nature, calculation of LP rotor RPM needed to
develop torsional forces capable of shearing
the stub shaft compared with design loads
indicated by IAE and deposition of expert
witnesses of IAE convincingly established that
the engines were at Take off Thrust or close
to Take off Thrust at the time of impact with
the embankment .
337

PART VI
DEVELOPMIVT OF FIRE
6.1(cid:9) When the aircraft hit the embankment, the
fuselage went sliding over the embankment causing
severe damage to the under surface of the fuselage
and the wings centre section. The engines and the
main undercarriage being ripped off the structure,
would have caused serious damage internally to the
wings and the fuel tanks. During this impact there
is a definite possibility of rupture of the fuel
tanks at the forward end. There was still 3500 kgs.
of fuel remaining in the tanks based on •the flight
plan fuel. During the severe deceleration of the
aircraft at the time of impact with the embankment
and possible rupture of the fuel tanks, and also
the severe deceleration at the time of the third
impact before the aircraft came to a final stop,
due to inertia, the fuel in the tanks would have
moved forward through the ruptures of the tanks and
spread all over the inside bottom portion of the
front fuselage. After the aircraft cane to a stop,
fuel would spill onto the ground. There were a
large number of stones in the area where the air-
craft caae to rest. Rubbing of the structure of
iliselage against these stones could easily cause a
spark to start the fuel fire.
Survivor witness (No.17), Mr. Kumar Nadig
has stated that the fire was coming out of the
338

cabin floor near row 10 or 11 in front of him.
This area would be near about the leading edge
of the wing root. He had occupied seat 12C.
6.2.(cid:9) Mr.Hemcband Jaichand, survivor witness
(No.6)2 who was sitting on seat 21,11. has stated
that he saw fire leaping out near about the 17th
row, right side. This area would be close to the
aft end of the wing root.
Mr.Sridhar, survivor witness (No.7), has
stated that he saw the fire in the front side
covering the entire front portion before he exited
the plane through the rear main door.
The two hostesses who survived have also
stated that there was fire and smoke in the front
portion spreading towards the rear.
Mr. Laxmiah Reddy, witness (No.22), who
saw the plane cowing down onto the marshy land has
stated that he heard a big sound likean 0-vnlosion
from the front portioh of the plane and heavy
blocks of smoke coming out of the plane.
The crew oxygen cylinder containing
oxygen under high pressure is located underneath
th, floor of the forward fuselage. Portable
ox..gen bottles are located in the cockpit and
cabin crew seat positions. These would have
assisted the fire tremendously.
339

From these statements, location of brew
oxygen bottle and portable oxygen bottles and the
photographs it seems that a fairly intense fire
started somewhere between the cockpit and the
leading edge of the wing root.
6.3(cid:9) The passengers seated in row 3E and 4D
have survived. Similarly passengers seated in 7C,
D and F, 8D and F have survived. From the state
ments of the witness Mr. Laxmaiah Reddy, it does
appear that an opening may have been created by
either the crash or the explosion somewhere around
that area for than to survive the fire. From the
seating charts, 46 passengers out of 53 seated in
rows 1 to 10 have died, indicating the severity of
the fire when i t started from underneath in that
zone.
6.4,(cid:9) Most probably the large number of oxygen
generators distributed through out the aircraft to
provide emergency oxygen supply at the time of
decompression, would have assisted in increasing
the intensity of the fire. The very fast spread
of the fire rearwards is also indicated by the
fact that 20 passengers out of 25 seated in rows
14 to 19 have died. From rows 11, 12 and 13, all
the 9 who were seated on the left side of the aisle
survived and one who was seated at 11D also survived.
6 passengers seated on the right side in these rows
have all died. We do know that the left hand side
340

(cid:9)(cid:9)
emergency exits were opened and these 10 people
would have survived coming out of those exits.
It is most probable that either the right hand
emergency exits were not opened by the passengers
sitting next to than or they were burnt after
exiting the plane, as intense fire had been observed
on the right hand side wing root area. Also, from
the post morten report it was observed that the
passenger seated at 127 had injury to his forearms/
hands and abdomen. May be he was incapable of
opening the exit next to him before being burnt to
death.
A large number of deaths upto row 19
indicates a very fast spread of the fire from the
front to the rear.
6.5(cid:9) From the fuel tank architecture the 'wing
tanks capacity is 12487 kgs. and the centre tank
capacity is 6600 kgs. This would be usable fuel
and there would be sane fuel left in the tanks at
the bottom which cannot be used. With 3500 kgs.
remaining on approach we would anticipate that this
would have been evenly distributed in the wing tanks.
The centre tank would have had only the unusable
Axel.
6.6(cid:9) From the inspection report of the Airbus
team there was a 10" x 6" hole in the forward spar,
apparently caused by some force from inside the
tank is indicative of a post crash explosion fran
341

(cid:9)(cid:9)
inside the tank. Even though some fuel was
retrieved from the left hand wing tanks, the fuel
which had spilled out onto the outside ground would
have contributed to the fire from the bottom. 30%
of the forward roof of the centre tank had been
completely destroyed and all the remaining Ilia
in the centre tank would have assisted the fire.
6.7(cid:9) It is not possible to know the duration
during which the aircraft was burnt and the time
that was available to the passengera inside the
plane to escape. From the intensity of the fire
the occupants of the forward seats had just a few
seconds before 'the fire engulfed then. As 10
passengers have escaped through the left hand exits,
assuming that 5 of than got out through each exit,
we may roughly estimate that the fire would have
engulfed this region in about a minute or slightly
less from the time of the third impact.
6.8(cid:9) As a large number of passengers from row
20 to 23 and possibly the two passengers from row
17 to 19 have passed through one rear exit, it
would appear that this above estimation could be
correct. Subsequently, the fire has spread out to
the rear section of the aircraft also. With the
comparatively low amount of fuel that was available
it is rather difficult to explain how the rear
passenger cabin was fully burnt upto the rear galley.
In all probability, the impact with embankment and
342

(cid:9)(cid:9)
the passage of the fuselage over and rubbing
against the embankment, may have caused a serious
rupture to the bottom surface of the fuel tanks
including wing tanks. This would have started
spilling the fuel when the aircraft came onto the
ground on its belly and elided forward to come to
a stop. Such fuel might have contributed to the
damage caused to the floor structure and burning of
all internal furnishings, baggage in the overhead
bins and under the seats, etc., again assisted by
oxygen generators.
6.9(cid:9) As only s300 kgs. of fuel has caused this
fire to spread to the entire aircraft and evidence
of fire has been recorded in the right wing root
area and forward and aft spars, the intense fire
due to the fuel may have lasted for a very short
period of time which was subsequently supported by
the furnishing, clothes, baggage, oxygen generators
and portable oxygen bottles, etc. From passenger
survival point of view it is not possible to
estimate exactly as to the time factor that was
available for then to escape.
6.10(cid:9) The airport fire station is located in
the middle of the airport below the control tower.
Even if the engines are kept running, for the crash
fire tenders to proceed from the fire station to
the end of R/W 09 and then onto the boundary wall
from where the first fire fighting actions were
launched, would have taken a minimum of 3 minutes
343

(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)
because there are turns, bad road, hump across
the crash barrier etc, to be negotiated.
Re: HAL.
6.11(cid:9) The fire fighting operation conducted by
the fire tenders at the Airport came under severe
attack by a few participants.
Actually two questions arose concerning
the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (for short HAL)
Airport.
6.12(cid:9) The Airport is under the control of HAL
which is an incorporated Company. HAL belongs to
the Government of India in its entirety. The
Inspector of Accidents in his report - Ex.C1
ranarked that this Airport was not licensed so far
even though under the aircraft rules licensing
was essential.
6. 13(cid:9) The second question pertains to the fire
fighting operation conducted immediately after the
era sh.
On the first question I do not think,
it is necessary for me to give a definite opinion.
However, a few points are indicated hereafter.
6.14(cid:9) The Aircraft Rules, 1937 are the Rules
framed by virtue of the power given to the Govern-
ment of India by the provisions of the Aircraft Act
and to some extent by virtue of Section 4 of the
344

Indian Telegraph Act and these Rules provide the
general conditions of flying, general safety
conditions, registration and marking of aircraft,
etc. Part-XI of the Rules govern the Aerodrcmes.
Rule 11 states that none shall use any place for
landings and departures of any aircraft ether than
an aerodrome licensed or approved for the purpose
in accordance with the provisions of Part-XI of
the Rules. Part-XI contains Rules 78 to 8?. As
per Rule 78 a Government aerodrome shall not be
open to use by any member of the public save to
such extent, if any, and subject to such conditions
as the Central Government may determine. Rule 79
states as follows:
"79.
Places other than Government
aerodromes - A place in India
other than a Government aerodrome
shall not be used as a regular
place of landing and departure by
a scheduled air transport service
or for a series of landings and
departures by any aircraft
carrying passengers for hire or
reward unless;
a) It has been licensed for the
purpose, and save in accord-
ance with the conditions
prescribed in such licence; or
345

b) It has been approved by the Director
General subject to such conditions
as he may deem fit to impose, for
the purpose of giving joy-rides for
hire or reward".
Rule 80 provides for licensing of the
aerodromes and Rule 87 provides the conditions
governing the grant of licence. It is clear from
Rule 79 that licence is not required for a Govern-
ment aerodrane.
Rule 3(27) defines Government aerodrome as
"an aerodrome which is maintained by or on behalf
of the Government and includes an airport to which
the International Airports Authority Act, 1971
appliGS. or is made applicable".
6.15(cid:9) Mr.Satendra Singh opined that the Bangalore
Airport belongs to HAL and therefore it is not
maintained by or on behalf of the Government and
if so_ licensing under Rule 79 is mandatory. The
HAL however has contended that HAL itself is
entirely owned by the Government of India and is
basically under the control of Defence Department
and on several occasions even the DGCA inspected
this airport and so far at no time this airport
was licensed except for one year during 1961. It
was pointed out that this airport has been functioning
from about the year 1940 and so far no authority
insisted that it has to be licensed under the Rules
346

and no authority found any fault for non-licensing
of the airport. It was pointed out that the
Inspector of Accidents himself is an official of
the Department of DGCA and DGCA never insisted that
HAL airport requires licensing. This airport was
established primarily for the defence purposes and
therefore has been under the control of the Ministry
of Defence, but at the same time it has also been
serviced for Civil 'Aviation. Three documents were
filed bn behalf of the HAL to point out that the
authorities of DGCA carried out inspections earlier
and the report in the prescribed form have been
submitted. In these circumstances it was contended
that no licensing was necessary. It is further
pointed out that the timings for the landings and
take off of various aircrafts are to be approved by
the Government of India and any user of the airport
by aircraft of other countries are also subject to
the approval of the Government of India.
6.16(cid:9) For the purpose of finding out the cause
or the causes of the aircrash in question I do not
think this question of licensing of the airport has
any bearing. The facilities available in this air-
port will have to be seen for the purpose of finding
out whether immediate action was taken to minimise
the effects of the crash; but for this, no other
question would arise because the investigation does
not disclose that in any manner either the ,ETC or
any other facility available in this airport has
347

contributed in any manner for the crash in /uestion.
Investigation reveals that the airport has satis-
factory facilities for the landing and take off of
the planes. Though some question was raised that
I.L.S. should have been there, that question was
incidently raised.
6.17(cid:9) Mr.Satendra Singh in his deposition stated
that this airport falls within the category-7 and
the requirements in respect of category-7 airport
are satisfied in this case. He also admitted that
the DGCA inspected this airport as is seen from
Exs.57 to 59, during the years 1982, 1983 and 1984
and that he is not aware of any complaint made by
the DGCA against this airport, which has not been
rectified or attended to. He also stated that the
use of this airport by different aircraft are
based on the approval of the Central Government and
that whenever there is change in the schedule or
timings regarding flights, approval of the Central
Government was being obtained and Ex.60 is one such
document containing certain telex messages. Fnr
category-7 airport, as per International standards
and recommended practices, the number and type of
rescue and fire fighting officials for this category
has been specified. For category-7 one R.I.V. and
two crash fire tenders (CFTs) are reauired.
6.18(cid:9) In his deposition, the third witness
P.M. Rao, who is the Senior Manager (Aerodrome)
348

HAL has stated that this airport is primarily for
the use of military aircraft produced or serviced
by HAL but subsequently after it commenced function-
ing in the year 1940 it was approved by the DGCA
for public use. Airports at Rune, Srinagar, Jorhat
etc. also similarly are under the control of the
Defence Department. The fire fighting equipments
and the personnel maintained at this airport,
according to him, are in accordance with the
standards prescribed by ICAO. The capacities of
the 2 CFTs maintained at this airport and their
discharge rates fully satisfy the ICAO standard.
However, .he admitted that the DGCA does not carry
out any inspection of the airports under the control
of the defence. He also stated that there was a
proposal to install ILS in this airport.
6.19(cid:9) The views of the Government of India on
this question of licensing are not disclosed to the
Court. Similarly, DGCA also has not placed any
material to assist the Court on this question of
licensing this airport. In the absence of a
direct participation by the Government of India or
by the DGCA, on the question whether the airport
requires licensing or not an expression of opinion
by the Court would be incomplete.
6. OD(cid:9) The fact remains that the facilities
available in the airport should be perfect as far
as possible and some sup ervi so ry authority should
be there to inspect pho airport periodioally and
349

(cid:9)(cid:9)
see that proper facilities and services are
provided and rendered. An inspection of the
airport by an outside authority would guarantee
that the airport is maintained properly. Comp-
lacence on the part of the personnel who are
entrusted with the various functions at the
airport can be prevented or at least reduced to
a large extent if such inspections are carried
out by a higher authority.
6.21(cid:9) Some of the participants taking the
clue from the report Ex.Cl, urged that there has
been laxity in the operation of the fire fighting
force. It was contended that the CFTs and the
RIV moved into the crash site after some delay.
This apart, the gate of the boundary wall could
not be opened in time, resulting in further delay
in the movement of the men and vehicles. By the
time the fire fighting operation became active,
the fire has already taken its toll. It was
contended that if there had been a prompt action
on the part of the fire fighting personnel, several
lives could have been saved.
6.22(cid:9) At page 24 of Ex. 1 the Inspector of
Accidents noted the facilities available at HAL
airport to fight fire and r ender rescue services.
Among other things the Inspector has observed what
the gate was not opened in time even though power
cutter was used to remove the lock. Therefore,
350

(cid:9)(cid:9)
the spraying operation was conducted from the
boundary wall and spray could not reach the
entire burning part of the aircraft. There was
no facility to refill the vehicles immediately.
The report also states that the communication
between the tower and the fire fighting personnel
was not direct and similarly there was no provision
to directly contact other lire fighting stations
in the city.
6.23(cid:9) HAL has taken strong exception to these
criticisms and asserted that there was no laxity
at all on their part and in the circumstances the
fire fighting personnel operated with utmost
promptness. Mr. Satendra Singh' s opinions expressed
in his report were based on the report he in turn
obtained from others who were assisting him in his
investigation after the crash. Therefore, his
opinion could not be justified by him directly
(i.e. by his personal knowledge) in the course of
his deposition.
6. 24(cid:9) Witness No.1, Mr. Sharma is the Deputy
Manager, Fire Service, HAL. He stated that there
are four fire stations under his control belonging
to HAL. The HAL aerodrome fire station i s the one
which is involved in the present situation. He
speaks about the various facilities, vehicles and
water sources available. He states that whenever
there is an aircraft activity such as landings or
take off, there is alprooedure presoribod for the
351

fire crew. The crew is alerted by the tower
by pressing a button, which shows amber light
in the fire station area. The firemen report
back to the tower to confirm receipt of the
message. Thereafter they position(cid:9) themselves
in the vehicle, the engines are started and kept
running. There is a walkie-talkie for inter-
communication between the tower and the crew apart
from an internal telephone. If there is any
emergency the tower gives audio-visual signal which
includes lighting of the red light and buzzer.
In such a situation the vehicles proceed to take
their position on the ramp. The red light and the
crash bell are put into use in case of an aircraft
accident/fire. On this the vehicles proceed towards
the runway collecting relevant informations enroute.
On the date of the aircrash in question these
vehicles which were in alert position turned out
from the fire station on hearing the crash bell and
on the way they could see a column of thick black
smoke at the western end of the air-field. Therefore,
they proceeded in that direction. According to
this witness absolutely no time was lost by the
vehicles and they proceeded to the scene of the
crash immediately and within two minutes the vehicles
must have reached the end of the runway.(cid:9) This
witness states that he was in his office on the date
of the accident. He heard shoutings in the ground
floor about the fire and immediately he came down,
jumped into a jeep; (by that time he saw one of
352

the CFTs and a jeep rushing out of the said
building. He instructed to call fire engines
from other divisions of the HAL. He also flashed
back a wireless message asking for the fire
engines from other stations including a message
to inform Karnataka Fire Force for help. At the
end of the runway he crossed over to the access
road which led into the emergency gate. He says
by that time two CFTs were already at the boundary
wall and discharging foam from their minotors. The
gate was not yet opened and therefore he issued
instructions to the Fire Officer to get the power
cutter and to open the gate and to bring the fire
engines out. However, he climbed over the gate and
rushed to the crash spot. This officer states that
he opened one of the doors of the plane and in this
regard there was a help by some one else also, but
no passenger was there inside the plane. But, smoke
was coming out. After this witness entered the
plane and moved towards the port side he heard
people crying for help.(cid:9) About 3 or 4 persons
including a lady were rescued behind the port wing
next to the fuselage. This witness went to the port
door and shouted for any survivcits,-----but—tliere_ was
no response. By that time CFT by name Godavari came
to the site and positioned behind the star board
wing and started discharging the foam. The REV
also arrived and started discharging the foam. He
says another vehicle Krishna also arrived, which
was positioned behind the tail and another vehicle
353

Thunga also came. Thick smoke was coming out and
fire was spreading towards rear of the plane and
it was burning at the top. After scmetime the
CFT returned after replenishment and positioned
at the nose of the aircraft and started dousing
operations. By this time the fire engine of
Karnataka Fire Force also arrived and engaged
itself in fire fighting.
This witness is a Fire Engineering (B.E.)
Graduate and has been trained in fire fighting
operations. According to him the time within
which rescue work is possible, is about 148
seconds after the crash because the temperature
at the end of this period will raise to about
390°F to 400°F, which is the survival limit.
of
Similarly the melt throughLthe fuselage will
occur in about 15 to 30 seconds. The flash point
of aviation gasoline is of the order of - 30°F
to -50°F with flammability range of 1.4 to 7.6%
and spontaneous ignition temperature of 824°F to
880°F. The fire spread rate is about 700 to 800 ft.
per minute. The witness has produced an issue of
°Fire Engineers' journal in support of his statistics.
Fran the boundary wall where the CFTs
were positioned initially, the burning portion of
the aircraft was well within the reach of the
monitors and the direction of the wind at that time
was from the front of the aircraft to the rear and
therefore the foam spray could move faster to a longer
354

distance because of the wind assistance. The normal
reach of the foam spray from the CFT will be
60 meters, but in this case the wind aided the
foam to reach another 5 to 6 meters. According
to this witness, but for the prompt action of
the fire fighting force the fire in the aircraft
could not have been brought under control and
damage would have been still more. The witness
also states that even though RIV need not be
compulsorily required as per the latest ICAO
recommendation, still here, it was being used.
He denied that there was any delay for,the CFTs
to reach the site. He also asserts that the
equipments and the facilities maintained at this
airport were according to the standards, inter-
nationally recognised. This witness was
thoroughly cross-examined by various partici-
pants. According to him the RIV and two CFTs
were. already there at the boundary wall and
were pouring the foam towards the burning site,
by the time he reached the gate. However, the
gate was locked and therefore none of than could
immediately go out towards the crash site. The
key was not kept with the fire station and he was
not aware as to where the key was kept. He also
deposed to the mock trial monitored by the tower
once in a month. But he admitted that no exercise
was conducted in respect of a crash occuring out-
side the boundary wall. The key was not with him
and it was not necessary for him to know where it
is kept because he had the authority to break
355

open the chain of the gate. According to him it
was the responsibility of the security personnel
to have the gate locked and preserve the key.
However, he has not given any satisfactory answer
as to why the personnel who were in the RIV and
in the two CFTs did not break open the gate. It
is the assertion of the HAL that the gate was
opened with a power cutter and such a power cutter
was available in one of the fire tenderers. If
so, it is un-understandable as to why there was
delay in cutting open the chain of the gate. It
is clear from the deposition of this witness that
RIV and CFTs had reached the boundary wall earlier
to him. When such a dense smoke was coming out
and fire was already spreading I do not think that
any reasonable person would have waited for any
other authority to order the cutting open of the
gate chain. The normal human behaviour in such a
situation will be to open the chain with the power
cutter available. Therefore, there seems to be
some strength in the contention of a few of the
participants that the power cutter was not avail-
able at all with the fire tenders. Neither the
key nor the cutter being available, the gate could
not be opened at the earliest point of time. .Added
to this, probably the gate had rusted and could
not be opened snoo thly. It has al so come in
evidence of this witness No.1 that no exercise
whatsoever was being conducted to keep oneself
ready for the eventua?_ities of the crash occuring
near the boundary wall. Obviously the gate was
356

never opened after it was fixed for a long time.
This inference is inevitable in the circumstances
of the case not only because of the statements
contained in the deposition of this witness, but
as will be presently seen from the deposition Of
a yew more witnesses.
6.25(cid:9)
At one stage in the cross-examination
this witness stated that the gate was opened about
2 minutes after the CFT reached the boundary wall
and he adults that at least a minute could have been
saved to reach the crash site if the OFT had used
the power cutter at the earliest point of time on
reaching the boundary wall. Having regard to the
nature of the fire and the preparedness required
to extinguish it, even a minute counts and most
probably this minute would haVe saved some years
of life time, of a few in the plane.
6.26(cid:9)
It is not known clearly as to whether
the power cutter was available in the vehicle and
if so the personnel in the vehicle failed to act
immediately for want of specific authority. It
is not known as to who were the other persons who
were in the other CFTs and the RIV, who could have
acted immediately before this witness reached the
boundary wall. A broad impression is inevitable
that there was some laxity on the part of someone
in the matter of opening the gate.
6. 27(cid:9) In fairness to HAI, it will have to be
noted one more aspect' at this stage. The fire could
357

be controlled provided the rescue work is done
within 142 seconds after the crash. This will
be 2 minutes 2E3 seconds. The plane had fallen
into a marshy area about ].50 ft. beyond the
boundary wall. The time that will be taken for
the fire fighting vehicles to reach the end of
the runway from the fire station is stated to
be 2 minutes (vide para 9 of Mr. Sharma' s affidavit,
made part of his deposition). If so, the fire
must have developed in intensity and must have
achieved great burning power, by the time the
CFTs reached the end of the runway and by t he time
they were positioned at the boundary wall further
spreading of the fire must have taken place.
Positioning at the boundary wall would itself
require at least half a minute. In these circum-
stances, whether the fire fighting operation would
have succeeded in reducing the damage, even if the
gate had been unlocked or opened immediately, Is
a matter of doubt. After the gate, to reach the
plane, one had to pass through a marshy land and
it is in evidence that one of the vehicle in fact
could not be moved and had to be pushed. Having
regard to these factors, for any vehicle to
reach the plane at the site in which it has fallen
would have taken at least 4 to 5 minutes from the
fire fighting station. The damage by that time
must have been complete; those passengers who
could save themselves or who were saved by the
rescue operation of others must have been saved
358

already.(cid:9)
If the situation is viewed from this
.angle, it is possible to hold that the delay of
a minute or so in opening the gate in the instant
case has not mattered either way. The deposition
ti..Ls witness discloses that CFTs reached the
boundary wall earlier to the RIV obviously because
the RIV did not accelerate itself to the expected
speed. This witness ::lso explains that those who
were in the vehicles had reached the boundary wall
earlier, concentrated on the aspect of extinguish...
ing the fire immediately by discharging the foam
from the said place, instead of considering the
question of breaking open the gate with the aid
of the power cutter. When a grave accident occurs
how a human mind reacts is beyond one's compre-
hension. This explanation of the witness also is
quite possible. The lack of exercise to meet the
situa-I:ion of this nature occuring outside the
boundary wall must have caused the men concerned
to forget about the power cutter.
6.28(cid:9)
Most of the accidents occur at the time
of landing or take off. The accidents at the time
of landing need not be always inside the airport
area. It may be near about as happened in this
case. Though the fire fighting vehicles are
primarily meant to meet a situation caused by the
accident within the airport area, it will be
necessary to note that the concerned personnel also
should be trained to act prcmptly at the time of
359

the accident that may occur near about the
airport also. Some periodical exercise in this
regard would train the personnel to meet the
situation.
6.29(cid:9) Witness No.2 is an Assistant Aerodrome
Officer in HAL. He has undergone the requisite
training. He is also a M.Sc.(Tech.). He speaks
about the functioning of the tower in the airport.
He was the person who received the short finals
report from the aircraft and issued 'the landing
clearance. He saw the aircraft suddenly going
down and dust and snoke were observed by him.
Immediately he sounded the crash bell to despatch
the CFTs. Normally it takes about one and half
minutes for an aircraft to land after short finals
are reported. This however depends upon the other
factors and usually short finals are reported when
the plane is about 400 ft above the ground. There
are binoculars in the tower having a range of
about 10 miles. His colleague was using the bino-
culars to check the runway, but he does not think
that his colleague was watching the aircraft flying
towards the air-field. Till the moment he pressed
the alarm bell whatever conversation was recorded
between the ATC and the aircraft was of this
witness. After pressing the alarm bell the further
communication recorded was of his second officer
because this witness immediately started initiating
emergency procedure.
360

6.30(cid:9) Witness No.3, Mr.P.M.Rao, who is the
Aerodrome Officer is not certain whether the gate
at the boundary wall was opened during the last
93 years. He admits that the key iS to be with
the security personnel and they are also involved
in implementing the emergency plan. But he fa
not aware whether any security personnel made any
attempt on the date of the crash to open the gate.
This witness asserts that the gate was opened by
the fire fighting personnel by using- the power
cutter. The fire station is just below the tower
and the distance between the gate and the tower
is about 6 to 7 thousand feet.
6. 31(cid:9) Witness No.13 is Capt.Vijay S. Sathaye.
He was to fly IC 604 on the day of crash from
Bangalore to Bombay and he was seated in his plane.
His radio was on and therefore he heard the landing
clearance given to the ill fated IC 605. He saw
th© aircraft coming in. lie was a close friend of
Capt. Gopujkar. He saw huge dust beyond the
boundary wall and instantaneously there was flame.
He saw the aircraft going up slightly and settling
down again. Realising that there was a crash he
trananitted to Bangalore ATC and told then about
the crash. Thereafter he ran towards the flight
despatch and from the flight despatch he went
towards the crash site along with Mr.Manjunatha
Ural (Witless No.16). On reaching the boundary
wall he found the gate closed and one fire tender
361

was spreading foam across the wall. He lumPed
over the gate and ran towards the aircraft along
with Mr.Ural and another Mr.Hurthy. He was
prevented from going closer to the plane by others
and he felt helpless particularly since both
pilots of the ill-fated plane were his close
friends. He remained at the 'crash site for approxi-
mately 10 to 15 minutes. During that period HAL
fire tender kept on spraying foam to the aircraft.
the foam was not reaching•the aircraft Com-
pletely because the fire tender was not near the
aircraft. According to him, when he Was there,
no other tender had come near the aircraft. He
returned thereafter and operated IC-604 to riombay.
During the period he was at the crash site the fire
was not under control. He also states that some
attempt was going on to open the gate by some
People when he reached the gate, with the help of
sbmething like a crowbar, but he did not notice
any power cutter being used. In view of the anxiety
he jumped over the gate which was 71 ft. height.
AenordIng to him he 1'f-inched the boundary wall about
in to 15 minutes after the crash-and- at the time
he was .jumping over the gate.attempt was still
gning on to break open the gate lock.
,:fitness Vo.16, Mr.ranlunatha Ural, is the
Flight Operations. Officer at Indian Airlines,
nantmlore. Mr.Vurthy is another such officer.
362

Mr.Ural says that Capt.Sathaye rushed into his
office and informed of the aircrash. Immediately
along with Capt. Sathaye and Mr.Murthy he rushed
to his jeep and drove towards the site of the
accident. On the way he was over taken by one
fire tender at the end of the runway. He saw one
crash tender already spraying water from inside
the periphery wall towards the plane. Thereafter
the second tender also reached the place. Three
of then Jumped over the gate and ran towards the
crashed plane. According to him some persons were
using ordinary fire axe to cut open the chain of
the gate. The gate was opened only by the time he
returned after about 10 minutes. Till he returned
from the site fire tenders had not come to the
spot at all. He was at the spot for about 10
minutes.
6.32(cid:9) There are a few more witnesses who have
referred to the fire extinguishing operations.
They include the Airbostessest a passenger and a
person who witnessed the crash; but none of then
is able to speak definitely about the movement of
the vehicles and the time taken for these fire
fighting vehicles to reach the crash site. Fran
a consideration of the entire evidence and the
circumstances as already observed by me it is not
possible to accept the case put forth by the HAL
that the gate at the boundary wall was opened
immediately. Certainly there was some delay and
363

the delay could have been avoided if the key
was available ta•open the lock or if the Dower
cutter was immediately used to cut open the
chain. Thougn Mr. Sharma had given some expla-
nation as to why the power cutter was not
propably used by the fire fighting personae'
who reached the boundary wall, the depositions
of Capt. Sathaye and Mr.Manjunatha Ural shows that
the delay in opening the gatei, was not marginal by
1 or 2 minutes, tut it took several minutes
before the gate was opened. It may oe, that even
if the gate, had been opened at the earliest point
of time and the rescue operation had started
immediately, the intensity of the damage would
have been the same. But, that is not a valid
reason to explain away the delay in opening the
gate and rushing towards the crash site. None
can foresee at that time whether immediate operation
at tile site was required or not. When large fire
had broken out the person concerned with the
rescue operations should rise to the occasion. His
profession and his training should mould him not to
get confused or deviate from the required action on
the ground of being confused oy the intensity of
the fire. These personnel should be trained to
act not only promptly, but also diligently. Their
mind should be alert towards the situation and act
to prevent the spreading up of the fire. These
persons cannot infer that it was too late for than
364

(cid:9)(cid:9)
to take any action and therefore they can proceed
to the crash site after attending to some other
preliminary rescue operation. This is a matter
for the H,AL to seriously ponder over and take an
appropriate action to train its fire fighting
personnel properly.
6.33(cid:9) One more fact requires to be noticed.
Ex.l (page 24) under sub-head 'Ambulance' it is
mentioned, "On the day of the accident, the medical
attendant was not present". During the cross-
examination of Mr.P.M.Rao, Senior Manager (Aerodrome)
(Witness No.3), he admitted that, '"Even though the
medical attendant was not on leave on the date of
the crash, I understand he was not present in the
ambulance. I understand that he went to the office
in connection with his personal work."
6.34(cid:9) Absence of medical attendant at the time
of this crucial hour when planes arrive or take off
indiates another sense of complacency on part of
the concerned personnel. The administration of
HAL should alert itself against such complacency.
Accidents occur unexpectedly. Those who are to
provide relief measures are expected to be always
vigilant and to be in readiness for action.

7. A JfirdiglmsdllEy. TRAINING
A-320 is a commercial jet transport aircraft
designed to be operated by 2 pilots. It is equipped
with Fly By Wire controls operated by sidestick
controls replacing the conventional control columns.
The FBW system controls both the primary and the
secondary surfaces. Computers which receive electrical
command signals from the flight deck, process the
infbrmation and transmit the commands to the appro-
priate hydraulic actuators operating the flight
control surfaces. The movement of Horizontal
Stabiliser for trunk purposes is automatic based
on computer commands only without any direct input
by the pilots. The movement of one sidestickcontio/
is not reflected on the other.
Flight Management and Guidance System (FMGS)
on the Ap-320 provides Auto Pilot Control, Flight
Director Commands, Auto Thrust Control, Rudder
Commands, Flight Envelope Computations, Infbrmation
Display Management etc.
The Auto Thrust System is designed in such a
way that the Thrust Levers do not move when the
system is active .
The aircraft is equipped with Full Authority
Digital Electronic Control (FADEC) to provide a
full range of engine control. 6 Cathode Ray Tube
(CRT) displays are used to replace conventional
instruments.
366

Majority of the pilots sent by Indian Airlines
fbr training on to A-320 were previously flying
Boeing 737 type ,of aircraft. The Indian Airlines
Boeing 737 aircraft is an early generation aircraft
with basic. Auto Pilot and Flight Director Systems.
It does not have an Auto Throttle system. There are
no FMGS or FADEC or any similar systems. There are
vast differences in the FM/. panel of the A-320 and
in
the panel is/similar location on the Boeing 737.
The Flight controls ate conventional and cable
operated 'using conventional control columns. Any
movement of one control column is reflected on the
other pilot!s control column.
Movement of these pilots from Ibeing 737 to
A-3201 needed to bridge a very great technology
gap from the 1960's to the late 1980's. Great
care is needed to achieve a good transition fbr ensuring
flight safety.
Indian Airlines had plenned to induct 19 A-320
aircrafts during the period May11989 to March11990.
This was a massitve task needing a large number of
pilots to be trained in a short period of time to
launch all these aircrafts into service. Ar-320
was a new type of aircraft being inducted into
Indian Airlines. It had neither the competency nor
the equipment and associated materials to carry out
the training themselves prior to the induction. It
was therefbre essential fbr them to depend on the
manufacturers to carry out the training of a large
number of the pilots.(cid:9)
367

One of the requirements fbr PIC endorsement,.
as per the Indian Aircraft Rules, is 100 hours
experience as a co-pilot befbre commencement of
10 mandatory route checks as PIC under supervision.
If this were to be satisfied, it would have been
impossible fbr Indian Airlines to induct these
19 aircrafts without hiring a very large number
of pilots from abroad qualified on A-320 to fly
these planes till th9 time their own pilots were
trained. Their licences had to be validated fbr
flying Indian aircraft, and a large number of
these hired pilots had to be check pilots or
instructors to carryout route training of
Indian Airlines pilots.
When a new aircraft is inducted, it is normal
practice to request fbr exemptions (including the
above 100 hours co-pilot requirement End 10
mandatory route checks) from the DGCA in favour
of experienced personnel to overcome this difficulty.
Such exemptions have been grEnted earlier by
the Ministry of Civil Aviation End the DGCA at
the times of introduction of A-320 into Indian
Airlines, Boeing 747, A-300 and A-310 into
Air India.
On 31,1-1989, Indian Airlines wrote to
DGCA, vide its letter HOP/25 8502/223, requesting
for various exemptions fbr training 152 pilots
(12 examiners/instructors, 103 captains and 37
co-pilots) in 16 batches at Toulouse. 2 DGCA
examiners on A-300/Ebeing 737 were to be trained
368

in February/March 1989 after which, they were to
fbrmulate and execute induction courses at CTE
Hyderabad fbr the remaining pilots befbre proceeding
to Toulouse fbr training.
Along with this letter, Indian Airlines had
enclosed copies of various training courses fbr
pilots, operations personnel and cabin attendants.
On 6-2.-1989 Deputy Director Flight Crew
Standards of DGCA, prepared a note wherein he has
given his comments regarding the exemption requests
from Indian Airlines. Briefly they are:
1. Course contents of technical, and simulator
training appear to be quite elaborate and adequate.
2.
Simulator capability has not been indicated
by Indian Airlines to ascertain the extent to which
the training thereon c be considered fbr acceptance.
3. Airbus Industrie does not maintain a cadre
of its own instructors. Pilots with experience
on type are mustered on contract from all over to
impart conversion training.
4. Experience and licence details of pilots to
be engaged by Aero fbrmation fbr imparting training
should be provided by Indian Airlines to consider
their suitability and validation of their licences.
5. Simulator and flight checks fbr type endorsement
may be carried out by French DGIO, examiners as-8149_
technical examinations rather than being checked by
pilots engaged by Aerofbrmation.
6. Required fbrms signed by French DG4G examiners
is acceptable.(cid:9)
369

7. Indian Airlines to indicate minimum number of
crew for whom exemptions are required to enable them
to introduce aircraft without any difficulty End
without compromising safety standards. It would not
be correct to allow exemptions of 100 hours co-pilot
experience and 10 mandatory route checks to all 103
captains.
8. Direct examinership/instructorship could be
considered on receipt of their perfbrmance and
check reports from Aeroformation/DGA9 France.
9. Carrying out of CA 40 WA checks on Aircraft
after successful completion of their A-320 simulator
training can be considered only after the capability
of the simulator is intimated to DGCA India.
10. India Airlines to provide biodata of
Aeroformation instructors along with security
clearance fbr validation of their licences.
11. As course contents submitted `)y Indian Airlines
for A-320 conversion appears to be quite -,.v.ilaustivel
there may be no objections in accepting course
completion certificate from Aeroformation.
12. Indian Airlines to have a discusgOin on all
points rather than have protracted correspondence.
A meeting was fixed for 9-3-1989 after
consulting DDG (K).
On 15-3-1989 Aerofbrmation sent a telex to
India] Airlines confirming that their A-320 courses
mac and their pilot
have been certified by French
370

instructors were approved.
On 30-3-1989 Indian Airlies requested the
approvnl o f
DGCA IbrZ21 Aerofbrmation instructors to fly Indian
registered aircraft and to act as examiners and
instructors. Details of their experience including
experience -on the A-320 had been indicated. It
should be noted that some of these 21 pilots had
very low experience on A-320 on 30-11-1988. Against
two names, namely, 'Sylvester and Lorenz, no A-320
flying experience had been indicated, but there
was a remark TBC.
On 24-4-1989 Indian Airlines wrote a letter
to the DGCA giving some details of the A-320
conversion course at Toulouse which included
paragraph (iv) on page 2 reproduced below:
"Flight training which will include
6 landings by day and 6 landings by
night fbr captains and .3 landings by
day and 3 landings by night fbr first
officers. This will consist of s
(1) go around with one engine.
(11) one instrument approach
(iii) one full stop landing ".
They have also indicated that as this course
has been approved by the French DGAC they were
requesting DGCA to accept the certificates of course
completion, simulator, flight and route checks
carried out by Aerofbrmation instructors/examiners,
CA 40 A/B Rims signed by them, etc. Direct
examinorship had been requested fbr Director of
371

Training, Director of Operations and Operations
Manager Training after completion of the course and
two route checks.
They also submitted a list of 70 pilots with
a request that the first 50 captains who successfully
completed A-320 conversion course be granted PIC
endorsements after 4 route checks. In this list of 70
pilots, Capt.Gopujkar was Number 38.
On 28-4-1989, 'Deputy Director Training and
Licencing, prepared a note fbr Director of Training
and Licencing and Deputy Director General which
briefly indicated the following:
1. Acceptance of Aerofbrmation training and
checks by Aerofbrmation instructors/examiners
approved by DGAC, France, towards grant of command/type
endorsement.
2. Approval of Aeroformation instructors/examiners
and approval of ground and simulator courses.
3. After examination the syllabus of ground
technical course, simulator booking and exercises,
submitted by Indian Airlines appeared to be adequate.
4. As list of 21 pilots of Aerofbrmation submitted
by Indian Airlines could be approved as examiners,
as they are approved instructors by DGAC, France
after their security clearance is obtained by
Indian Airlines. Their licences also may be
validated to fly Indian registered aircraft.
The note was counter signed by DTL on
1-5-1989, DDG on 2-5-1989 and Mr.P.C.Sen, Director
372

General, approved the validation of the licences
of the list of pilots enclosed on 5.5.1989.
The preliminary meeting between DGCA officials
and Indian Airlines was held on 29-3.1989 in
connection with A-320 training. As per Indian
Airlines letter Number HOP/27 10085/762 of 13/17th
Anr11,3989, the decisions taken were that the
uirector of Operations, Director of Training
and Operations Manager Training would be granted
PIC endorsement on A-320 after carrying out two
route checks instead of 10 route cnecks. The
requirenent of 100 hours P2 experience 411 be
waived.
The above three would be granted examinership
after grant of PIC endorsement. The other decision
was, for 40 additional pilots 100 hours P2 experience
would oe waived and PIC endorsement would be
after 4 route coecks and 20 of these pilots would
be allowed to act as examiners/instructors on A-320.
On 4-5-1989 security clearance of the 21 Aero-
fbrmation/Airbus Industrie Pilot instructors was
intimated to Indian Airlines by the ministry of
Civil Aviation.
On 8-5-1989, Indian Airlines fbrwarded to
DGCA the flying experience of 70 pilots slated for
training on A-320,
On 6.6.1989, a note was prepared by En
officer of the DGCA to the DDFCS that Ministry of
Civil Aviation had intbrmed Indian Airlines of
373

the security clearance of the 21 Aerofbrmation/Airbus
Industrie pilot instructors. If approved their
licences could now be validated fbr a period of 6 month
as Indian Airlines had intimated the Ministry that
their stay in India was likely to be 6 months. On the
sane day it was approved by DDFCS and later vide
letter No.F.lio.83/89/L(I) dated 6-6-3989 to the
Director of Operations, Indian Airlines, the DGCA
validated the licences of all 21. Aerofbrmation/Airbus
Industrie Instructors under Rule 19 of the Indian
Aircraft Rules,1937.
On 7-6-1989, the DDFCS prepared a note fbr
the attention of Mr.S.K.Gupta, Junior Analyst in
the Ministry of Civil Aviation quoting DGCA U.O.
No.81/89/L(I) dated 5-6-1989.
The above note was on the subject of exemption
fbr pilots of Indian Airlines from flying A-320
aircraft. Some of the contents of this note are
briefly indicated below:
(a) Indian Airlines pilots are being trained in
batches at Toulouse on Indian registered aircraft.
According to the arrangements arrived at the pilots
of Indian Airlines who are deputed fbr training 411
be subjected to thorough technical ground/simulator
and inflight training on completion of the training
period, they will be subjected to a flight
test by
the examiners of the Airbus Industrie in accordance
with the laid down standards. The examiners will
submit the required reports and if satisfactory
374

after scrutiny by this department they will be
accepted fbr the grant of endorsement on A-320.
(b) For grant of PIC endorsement it was recommended
that the first 53 pilots of the enclosed list may
be exempted from the requirement of 100 hours co-pilot
experience on type and they would also be exempted
from the requirement of 10 mandatory route checks
but shall carry out 4 route checks with approved
examiners. However, Director of Training and
Operatidns Manager of Training shall carry out two
route checks with Aeroibrmation examiners.
(c) Licences of Aerofbrmation examiners have
already been validated.
(d) Exemption of technical exams in aircraft and
engines on A-320 conducted by DGCA can be granted,
provided the pilots trained at Airbus Industrie
have been assessed by examiners of Airbus Industrie
as having adequate proficiency in their technical
knowledge.
The note has quoted that exemptions, had been
granted to Indian Airlines and Mr India, in the
earlier years at the time of introduction of other
aircrafts. This note had been issued by the
approval of DDG.
On 3-7-1989, vide AV 11013 9/89 At the
Government of India, Ministry of Civil Aviation
and Tourism issued so order granting exemption from
100 co-pilot hours on A-320 to 53 pilots of
Indian Airlines with a proviso that they should
375

carry out 10 mandatory route checks 'before FIG i8
given. Capt.Gopujkar was included in this list.
After some earlier correspondence on 16-1-19901 the
Managing Director wrote to DGCA vide his letter
No.HOP/ 25 '8502/321 indicating difficulty in the
introduction of the fleet and requesting exemption
fbr a further 22 pilots.
On 25-1-1990, DDFCS prepared a note on the
subject of exemptions from 100 hours co-pilot
experience fbr grant of PIC on A-320. Indian Airlines
pilots quoting all earlier correspondence. The case
had been discussed with Director of Operations, Indian
Crlines. 90 Commanders were needed by February,1990
to operate 18 aircraft at 5 sets of crew per aircraft.
The note also indicated the status of exempted
and non-exempted pilots slated for II-320 command as
on that date.
Basel on the earlier criteria of 2500 hours
PIC experience on }being 737, the note requested
aPproval fbr 14 more pilots to be recommended to
the Ministry for exemption under Rule 160 of Indian
Aircraft Rules,1937. The exemptions shall be from
compliance with the requirement of 100 hours co-pilot
experience fbr PIC. However, mandatory 10 route
checks have to be carried out. This note was signed
by DDG(K) on 25-1-1990 and DG on 1-2-1990.
Government of India, Ministry of Civil Aviation
issued an order vide their letter No.AV 11013/9/89 A
376

dated 12-2-3990 exempting 14 more pilots of Indian
Airlines from the requirement of 100 hours co-pilot
experience on A-320. However, 10 mandatory route
checks should be carried out bailor*, PIC rating was
given. Capt.C.A.Fernandeg was included in this list.
There are a few very important observations from
all the above proceedings in respect of granting
exemptions and acceptance of Aerofbrmation training.
(a) Though DDFCS hati made a note on 6-2-1989 that
simulator capability has not been received to ascertain
the extent to which the training thereon can be
considered fbr acceptance, he has prepared another
note on 7-6-1989 Ibr the attention of the MinistrSr
of Civil Aviation which indicates that pilots who
are being trained at Toulouse could be subjected to
a flight test after thorough technical ground/simulator
and inflight training. From the files provided
by the DGCA, the Court has not observed any material
regarding the capability of the Aerofbrmation
simulator.
(b) DDFCS had made a note on 6-2-3989 that
experience and licence details of Aerofbrmation
instructors was needed to consider their suitability
prior to their validation. But, it is observed
that no attempt had been made to obtain the flying
experience on A-320 aircraft in respect of two
pilots namely Capt.Sylvester and Capt.Lorenz. The
records had only shown TIC against their A-320
flying experience and( TBD against their Airbus
A-320 type rating.(cid:9) 377

The basis on which these two pilots were approved
as examiners to train Indian Airlines pilots is not
fb rthcoming.
(c)(cid:9) Though the reference to flight training has
been made on 24-4-1989 by Indian Airlines in. their
letter to the DGCA (No.HOP/25 8502/81.7) and inflight
training had been indicated in the first paragraph
of the note of DDFC$ dated 7-6..1989 to the Ministry
of Civil Aviation there is no evidence of flight trainint
having been imparted to Capt.Gopujkar and Capt.Fernandez
befbre their flight test by approved examiners on
the aircraft.
The A--320 training records of Capt.Gopujkar
shows that after his simulator check during session
FF37 with Capt.Phillips, he has been taken directly
fbr CA 40 B(J) day check on aircraft VT-EPF on
19-7-1989 and for his CA 40 B(J) night check on
the same aircraft on 21-7-1989. Capt.M.Fillion
has carried out both the day and night checks. In
the case of Capt.Gopujkar two—forms bave been filled
up for each of the flight tests which are Aerofbrmation
fbrmat and CA 40 B(J) of DGCA. There -is a discrepancy
in the date in the two forms of the night check.
In the Aeroformation format; the date of 20-7-1989
has been indicated and at the bottom it has been
shown that Capt.Gopujkar was qualified fbr type
endorsement. On the CA 40 E(J) the date of
21-7-1989 has been indicated with chocks off
chocks
time as 00:45 hours and/on time as 01:55 hours.
378

The night ¶heck assessment was above standard. It
does appear that as the crew went fbr the night flight
on the 20th night, the Aerofbrmation fbrmat may have
the date of 20-7-1989 and because of the actual local
times being indicated, the date has been shown as
21-7-1989 (which uould be correct).
Similarly the training file of Capt.Fernandez
has shown that he has satisfactorily completed his
simulator check with Gapt.Steele on 19-11,1989. The
CA 40 Eu) check by day which was domain India on
VT-EPG was on 3-12-1989 with Capt.Thergaonkar
between 08:30 and 09:30 hours. The night check
was on the sane day and on the same aircraft with
Capt.S.T.Deo between 18:15 and 19:40 hours.
kir.O.P.Ahuja, Deputy Director Flight Crew
Standards, gave evidence befbre the Court on behalf
of the DGCA. During cross examination he deposed
that:
Whenever a new aircraft is inducted into
an airlinei initially the pilots are trained by
the manufacturer's training centre.
The instructors of the training centre are
approved if they meet the criteria of approval as
laid down by the DGCA. However, the DGCA is empowered
to relax these requirements.
Under Rule 41A(2) the DGCA accorded approval
to appointment of examiners for carrying out flying
tests and technical examinations. Rule 41A( 3)-
was also complied with.(cid:9)
379

Indian Airlines approached the DGCA fbr
according approval to instructors/examiners of
Aeroformation for imparting training and to carry
out assessment checks of their pilots undergoing
training at Aerofbrmation.
Mr.Ahuja also stated that the proposals made
by the Airlines are examined by a Board of Officers
dealing with the subject in the DGCA. The
Board comprises(cid:9) Deputy Director of Training
and Licensing, Deputy Director Flight Crew Standards,
Director of Training and Licensing and if need
be the Deputy Director General is also associated
with the examination of sticth proposals.
There are no documents regarding the formation
of such a Board to examine the proposals made by
Indian Airlines in the files submitted by the
DGCA. Similarly Court did not find any recorded
notes of an internal meeting between the various
officers mentioned earlier forming the Board.
Some no te-s being prepared and sent for approval
to the next higher official as a normal administrative
practice, were seen.
The Court is of the view that in future, it
would be a safer practice to form a Ebardtmembers
of which would sit together and carefully ermine
every
aspect of training befbre recommending
exemptions to the Ministry as well as the DGCA fbr
granting exemptions.

During the cross examination by learned
Counsel on behalf of Consumer Association a question
was raised whether Air India in the year 1986-8?
had sought permission to send pilots fbr proficiency
checks and recurrent training in A-310 simulator
at Singapore(cid:9) The witness stated that he did not
know anything about the case and that whether
Air India had indicated that the Singapore simulator
data was different from the GE engines on the
Air India aircraft.
Later the correspondence on the above subject
between Air India and DGCA was sent to the Court
by the office of the DGCA. It was observed that
a request had been made by Air India in the letter
of October,1986 fbr the use of A-310 simulator
facility at Singapore wherein Air India had clearly
stated that the simulator at Singapore was fitted
with PW engines which were not compatible with
Air India aircraft combination as their aircrafts
were fitted with GE engines. There were a few
letters exchanged between the DGCA and Air India
on the subject till the third quarter of 1987.
Air India in its letter of 11-4-1987 had confirmed
that fbr initial conversion training, only Aero-
formation simulator fitted with GE engines would be
used; though only for recurrent training, use of
A-310 simulator at Singapore had been requested.
However, no letter from the DGCA granting approval
was placed before the Court.
381

During the Court proceeding it has come out
that the Aeroformation A-320 simulator used for
training Indian Airlines pilots did not have the
V-2500 data or the instrumentation during the training
of quite a large number of Indian Airlines pilots.
The simulator had been programed with CM 56 engine
data and had the associated display. Full flight
simulator training of both Capt.Gopujkar and
Capt.Fernandez was conducted using CFM 56 engines.
This was stated by Capt.Richard Steele) an Airbus
training captain during his deposition.
The basis as to how the concerned department
of the DGCA accepted training of Indian Airlines
pilots on an A-320 simulator fitted with CFM 56
engines without any reservations and special stipulations
is not clears
( a) Though they had expressed apprehension about
the use of a simulator with a different engine
configuration even for proficiency checks and
recurrent training during 1986-87 in the case of
Air India.
Though DDFCS had noted on 6-2-1989 that
(b)
simulator capability is necessary to ascertain the
extent to which the training thereon can be considered
for acceptance.
Accepted the simulator training on the
(c)
Aerofbrmation simulator which was not compatible
with Indian Airlines

an alysi s. 382

From the training files of Capt.Gopujkar and
Capt.Fernandez, it is to be noted that a part of
CA 40
13(J) check has been carried out on the Aero-
formation simulator which was not compatible with
Indian Airlines aircraft engine combination.
bbr the future, when
new aircraft would be
inducted by any airline it would be prudent for the
DGCA to prepare a fbrmat which should be answered
by the organisation concerned obtaining complete
basic data, along with the requests for various
exemptions etc.(cid:9)
The Board as indicated earlier
could then evaluate the proposal in to to if
necessary with concerned officials of the airline
before fbrmulating and approving the complete
training programme.
During the cross examination of Mr.Ahuia,
it has come to light that for a considerable time
the post of the Director General of Civil Aviation
had not been filled by a full time incumbent. Post
of DGCA is a sensitive post and his responsibilities
are both statutory and administrative. Important
and delicate questions are to be met by the DGCA.
Any Adhocism in the appointment of DGCA is not in
the public interest. It is doubtful whether a
temporary incumbent holdZian igher responsible post
would discharge his functions independently, at all.
I am of the firm view that practice of making
temporary appointments or placing some one incharge
383

of this responsible post and thus extend the adhocism
to such an appointment should be given up.
Capt.V.P.Thergaonkar, Operations Manager Training,
Indian Airlines, who is qualified and also an approved
examiner on A-320, deposed before the Court on behalf
of Indian Airlines. In his affidavit dated 7th
May, 1990 he has stated that during training at
Toulouse:
1. There was '1 hour with full flight simulator
and 7 fixed base simulator sessions (phase I) of
2 hours each (1 hour per pilot per session) during
the ground phase of 2 weeks.
2. 7 sessions of fixed base simulator (phase 2 )
of 3 hours each (14- hours per pilot per session) and
7 sessions on full flight simulator of 3 hours
3.
each ( 1i hours per pilot per session). The 7th
session was a simulator check.
The affidavit also states that the training
at Toulouse covered flight training which will
include 6 landings by day and 6 landings by night
fbr captains and 3 landings by day and 3 landings by
night fbr first officers which would include go around
with one engine, one instrument approach and one
full stop landing.
Passing marks for ground score examination
was raised by Indian Airlines to 80% from the
Aerofonnation and DGSkc requirement of 70%.
384

Training at Toulouse was entirely carried
out by Aeroformation instructors.
Capt.Gopujkari s route checks had been carried
out by Capt.Pillion, Capt.Deo and Capt.Baud.
DGCA had approved 5 Indian Airlines pilots
as examiners, of which one has resigned. DGCA
also approved 7 pilots as check pilots out of a
list of 10 pilots. Capt.Gopujkar was one of the
approved check pilots: All these were released
as check pilots after satisfactory completion of
local flight check and 2 route checks from the
right haul seat.
Annexure-1 and Annexure-2 which were attached
to the affidavit of Capt.Thergaonkar are the two
versions of the training conference held in Toulouse
in November,1957. There are a few differences
in the two annexures in the understanding of the
composition of flight crew training course. In
Annexure-1 the 7 sessions of FBS phase-1 and
7 sessions of FBS phase-2 and the 7 sessions of
FFS training have all indicated cleay
-the amount
of training per pilot as half the duration of
the session. This Indian 'Airlines report has also
indicated that the last session of the FBS phase-2
will be a sort of assessment of the pilot fbr
having reached the required standard before
commencement of FFS training. Similarly this
Indian Airlines report has indicated that
385

the 7th FFS session would be a check ride carried out
by an approved flight instructor.
Indian Airlines has used the word "flying
training" in its report. It has indicated that it
would consist of CA 40 A and B checks. Though all
this would have been discussed during the training
conference, in Annexure-2, Aerofbrmation has not
indicated that the 7th FFS session would be a check
session. It has used `the word "flying training
phase". The training records of Capt.Gopujkar
shows that the instructor has carried out a flight
check only and filled up the CA 40 13(J) report
by day and night and also the IRC and LRC on the
aircraft in the pilot proficiency check report.
In Annexure..2 under heading "Documentation"
Aerofbrmation has indicated that "Each trainee will
be provided with appropriate training documentation
at the beginning of the course including ...
Flight Crew Operating Manual (FCOM)
RTC fb.--i; 12 instructors (FIF)".
Under course organisation, Aeroformation has
indicated in paragraph 4.2 "Since all courses will
be given in English, trainees will rend, write and
speak English fluently".
Capt.Thergaonkar during his deposition stated
that Capt.Gopujkar had 28 hours of training on
simulator and about 3 hours of actual flight and
Capt.Fernandez also similar training and
had

had been exempted from the 100 hours co-pilot
requirement. He had done 11 route checks. This
additional route check was because of the requirement
of being examined by one more examiner.
Capt.Fernandez
was not exempted initially but later he was exempted
of this 100 hours co-pilot experience; by that
time he had gained 68 hours of experience as a
co-pilot in A-320.
Capt.Fernandez was on his first route check
on the ill-fated flight. Though none could personally
assert as to who was in charge of the controls on
14th February,1990, entire take off and landing
including cruise should have been done by Capt.Fernandez
because he was under route check. From CVR/DFDR
transcript, it is clear that Capt.Fernandez was

speed knob and altitude knob in A-320 cockpit are
in close proximity. There are some differences
between the two knobs. He had also committed mistakes
in selecting the knob by mistaking one for the
other on two or three occasions. Other pilots also
may have made similar mistakes and he had seen
a French pilot committing the mistake on the A-320
simulator at Hyderabad. At page 10 of his depositiob
he has stated that the training course makes the
pilot familiar in most respects in respect of 11-.0.
Later he stated "only in general terms, at the
time of training at Toulouse, we were told that the
acceleration timing
of q-2500 engines are larger
387

than other engines".
At page 11 he stated as below:
It The Indian Airlines entirely relied
on the Aerofbrmation fbr the training.
However, before the training started they
had discussions and certain modifications
resulted in the training to suit Indian
conditions. Indian Airlines had to rely
on Aerofbrmation 1hr training because it
was the only place where training in
A-320 was available with the simulators.
Further, Aeroformation is a subsidiary
of the Airbus Company and the programmes
were developed by the manufacturers.
The training course of Aeroformation is
also approved by DGAC of France".
Capt.Richard Steele (witness No.19) during
his cross examination has stated that each pilot
has undergone about 57 hours of simulator training
and he thought that Capts.Gopuikar and Fernandez
had 3 hours of base flying training. He has also
stated on Pages 3 and 4 that in the case of
Capt.Gopujkar VACBI was ibr V-2500 engine and the
FCOM in his position was related to V-2500 engine.
Capt. Fernandez was required to do a remedial session
check and in the recheck thereafter
after his FFS 7
he was found fit for command endorsement. On
page-11 he has stated that the training imparted
at Toulouse strictly complied with the syllabus
388

of the DGCA and agreed by Indian Airlines. He also
stated that European certification authorities have
certified the A-320 simulator with CM 56 engines
for training pilot's fbr A-320 aircraft with V-2500
engine and they included UK CAA and the authorities
of Cyprus and Yugoslavia. In this connection Appendix
C?In•ed.
Capt.Steele ,in his deposition indicated the
modifications to the course by Indian Airlines,
such as to increase pass mark from 70% to 80% in
technical examination, modify simulator 7 session
to meet requirements of Indian Airlines and DGCA,
increase the number of non-precision approaches in
the syllabus and increase the amount of base training
to double the standard course level.
Capt.Steele confirmed that Capt.Gopujkar had
undergone simulator training, base training and
line training at Aeroformation. However he did
not undergo flight instructor's familiarisation
course. If he had undergone this training he would
have been trained to handle mishandled approaches
including at low speed at idle thrust in close
proximity to the ground. A line pilot however would
know how to handle the plane at a low level and
low speed and low thrust. This witness further
stated that his own training on A-320 lasted fbr
about 6 months. At that time the aircraft was
under development. He was also responsible in
part for the creation of the A-320 course.
389

Again Capt.Steele stated:
"The instructors are given training
to recover from low speed at the low
level. I do not expect a line pilot
or the check pilot to get into a
situation of low level with a low speed.
I expect them to recognise such a
situation and take a prompt recovery
action. The line pilots and check pilots
are instructed as to how to recover from
such a situation. This is different from
an instructor taking recovery action
1bllowing an error made by another pilot.
I did not have an occasion to get into an
approach which Capt.Fernandez got into
in this case. I have not also seen such
a situation in the simulator. Whenever
such an error is made by a trainee in the
simulator he has been taught to recover
from it".
Later he has stated that he has come across
trainees during training making wrong selections
of the knobs on the FCU but he has not come across
any certified pilot committing such an error.
He has also stated that in the case of
Capt.Fernandez ground training, FCOM and VACBI

exceptions of section 11 and 14 and all FFS training
was conducted utilising all CF14 56 engines.
390

Capt.Steele deposed that he had flown the
aircraft fitted with both type of engines. From
experience he could say that operationally there
was no significant difference.
Capt.P.A.Bhujwala (witness No.24) was the
co-pupil with Capt.Gopujkar, He has clarified that
if the training in FFS was for 3 hours, 1+ hours
training would be fbr Capt.Gopujkar and the other
1+ hours would be fbr 'him. While one actually
operates as a trainee ,the other will be participating
as a co-pilot. At Toulouse he had 28 hours of
conversion simulator training from Boeing 737 to
A-320.
Capt.Bhujwala explained that items 16 to 19
in FBS 8 were demonstrations and pilots were asked
to notice alpha floor indication on FMA and upper
ELAN and then TOGA being registereu on ECAM. Under
item 18 he did not notice the time taken for the
engine to develop full power and it was CBM 56 engine.
Capt.Fillion carried out his flight checks. He
also stated that he was not told that the engines
required atleast 8 seconds•to pick up full power
and ho had also not realised the sane at any time.
However, it was pointed out to him that it was a
high bypass engine and therefbre spool up time
was appreciably more. He did not recollect whether
anyone told him that acceleration from approach
idle to TOGA would be longer with alpha floor
compared to thrust levep movement to TOGA. According
to Copt. Bhujwal a Alpha floor should always be
391

backed by thrust lever movement to TOGA. Here it
is necessary to refer to the deposition of Capt.Gordon
Corps as below:
Q Wozild Airbus Industrie expect a customer to
have complete and thorough knowledge of the aircraft
like themselves with respect to the customers for
them to design profile training for their air crew
when they introduce a new aircraft to the field?
A : I woad imagine that the customers use their
experience from other training programmes to assist
them in making these decisions.
Q : Do you think that there could be such serious
omissions in the A-320 profile training given to
Indian Airlines A-320 pilots in respect of demonstration
of certain system operation and their critical nature
under certain specific flight condition fbr example
inadvertent idle open descent engagement during
manual flight on short finals?
A I am not involved in the detail of the training
programme at this level.
Q : Do you know that the page of FCTM you have
attached with your affidavit of 5-5-'1990 are dated
January, 1990 and did not exist on the dates
Capt.Gopujkar and Capt.Fernandez were trained at
Toulouse?
A : It is correct that the FC1N itself had not
k been issued at that step.
392

The witness agreed that Airbus Industrie is
responsible fbr the ROM. When he was shown certain
pages of the fully updated volumes of FCOM supplied
to the Court after the crash and the :,:ame pages in
the manuals which had been issued Lc.) late Capt.Gopujkar
during his training he concurred that they pertained
to Cat 56 engines.
On page 87 Capt.Gordon Corps agreed to the
suggestion that if any pilot shows a serious
deficiency of not monitoring speed on final approach
wherein he drops his speed by 20 to 25 kts. from
desired minimum approach speed he would not be
approved as a captain by any right thinking
instructor.
Training records of Capt.Gc)r:o kar shown th_t
he has been assessed as above standard during his
flight check by night after satisfactory simulator
check. He has been issued with a type rating
on A-320 as captain and certificate c f course
completion of CAT II training on--A---320 by the
President of Aerofbrmation. He was co-nsidered
"above standard" by Capt.Baud of Airbus Industrie
during one of his route checks,
Similarly Capt.Fernandez was checked by
Capt.Richard Steele on the simulator after a
corrective training session had been completed and
had been certified fit fbr command endorsement on
one of the DGCA fbrmaps. He was also issued
certificates of course completion of both EFC II upto
393

and including simulator and CAT II training by the
President of Aerofbrmation.
Capt.Steele was the only witness who stated
that each pilOt was given 57 hours of simulator
training by Aeroformation. Capt.Thergaonkar had
a total flying experience of 11600 hours in May0989
of which over 8500 hours were as captain. He
has been a DGCA approved instructor and examiner
for quite a few years and he has trained a large
number of pilots of Indian Airlines on•various
types of aircraft. Indian Airlines also possess
quite a few simulators which are used both for
full flight simulator sessions and whereever
applicable for CPT (Cockpit Procedure Training)
sessions also. He has differed totally in respect
of the number of hours of simulator training given
to Capt.Gopujkar and Capt.Fernandez(cid:9) Capt.Bhujwala
has also clearly explained that during the full
flight simulator session of 3 hours, each of the
pupils got 13- hours and fbr one half of a session
the trainee participated as a co-pilot. It has
to be concluded, nerefore.;_ that 57 hours of
simulator training is shared by two pilots and
that each pilot did not experience the actual
training for the full 57 hours, each experienced
2E* hours of simulator training and the other
28-3- hours his experience was of a co-pilot in the
simulator. With the improvement in technology,
more and more training establishments are using
either a fixed base simulator or even a fu.1.1 flight
394

simulator for what was earlier known as systems
training and cockpit procedures training. Aero-
formation may use fixed base simulators presently
for the purposes of systems training and procedure
training. Examination of the various fixed base
simulators phase-A does indicate that after every
stage of VACBI the pupil is exposed to the detailed
performance of those systems in that stage in
the FBS. This system exposure cannot be considered
as simulator training. The profile of FBS phase-B
are a demonstration of various exercises and how
they should be handled. Capt.Bhujwala has explained
the exercises from 16 to 19 in FBS 8, which clearly
shows it was a demonstration. This would correspond
to what was termed cockpit procedure training a
few years ago. Only 'Hands on' flight simulator
training would give a pilot the feel of the aircraft
performance under various conditions of flight.
He can get this only on a full flight simulator
when he is acting as a PF. Further the 7th FFS
session is not a simulator training session. No
check session can ever be considered as training.
This would further reduce the amount of simulator
training a pilot has received during his conve sion.
Though Capt.Steele gave evidence as representing
Airbus Industrie in training matters, it was felt
that the simulator training has not been properly
presented before the Court by him. Therefbre,
all the exercises during the simulator session and
flight session given tot Capt.S.T.Deo and Capt.L.Man-
chanda fbr their instructors training were examined.
395

There was no exercise which dealt with handling
a mishandled approach at low speed at idle thrust
in close proximity to the ground. Similarly none
of the FBS or FFS pro files have an exercise wherein
a line pilot has been instructed to recover from
a situation of low level at low speed and low thrust.
Capt.Steele himself never had an occasion to get
into an approach similar to VT EPN and be had also
not seen such a situation on a simulator. Airbus
Industrie was not quite candid and failed to
present a correct picture of the training in the
evidence adduced on their behalf.
In Annexure-2 of Capt.Thergaonkarl s deposition,
Aeroformation has indicated the requirement of
trainees to know English well. One of the Assessors
during his visit to Aeroformation in June,1990
had specifically requested for a French Instructor
for his FBS/FFS sessions. During the session
it was observed that, when clarifications were
sought the Instructor A riff iieulAy in explning.
The Court had desired that Airbus Industrie
should produce certain instructors who had taken
-p-art in training Capt.Gopujkar and Capt.Fernandez
to obseve as to how they would explain certain
procedures befbre the Court and the participants.
Unfortunately Airbus Industrie indicated that
this would upset its training progranmes if these
persons have to be called to depose befbre the
Court. The possibility of a certain lack of
396

understanding on the part of the pupils because
of tho difficulty In the explanations in clear English
language by the concerned instructors has to be
posed and /eft as such.
In the sane Annexure.2 it is mentioned that
Aeroformat3on would provide the trainees with appro-
priate documents including FOOM. The documentation
provided to Capt.Gopujkar during his training had
certain pages which were not appropriate to the
aircraft he was being trained fbr. Similarly Airbus
Industrie which is responsible fbr FCOMi s, also
had not provided correct and appropriate documentation
to Indian Airlines till the date of the crash, as
evidenced by the fully updated documents provided
to the Court, but which had pages, not appropriate
to the Indian Airlines aircraft.
Similarly Aerofbrmation should have provided
a copy of an FC114 at the beginning of the FIF course
to Capt.Deo and Capt.Manchanda. They had done their
simulator session on 5-6-1989 and 18-7-1989 respectively.
As per_Capt.Gordon Corps FCC itself had not been
issued when Capt.Gopujkar and Capt.Fernandez were
trained at Toulouse. Capt.Copujkar did his simulator
check on 18-7-1989 and Capt.Fernandez did his check
on 19-11-1989. Proper documentation as per training
conference had not been made available to the two
instructors named above during their training.
The approval of the A-320 course by DGAC France
was furnished by Airbus Industrie. Aerpfbrimation

in his deposition.
A-320 is a new technology Fly-By-Wire aircraft.
Airbus Industrie has sold this aircraft to Indian
Airlines which did not possess any aircraft similar
to this earlier. Capt.Gordon Corps observation
( at page 84) that customers use their experience
from other training programmes to design profile
training fbr their crew, cannot be correct.
Capt.Thergaonkar who has experience of training
a large number of pilots has stated that Indian
Airlines entirely relied upon Aerofbrmation for
the A-320 training. Mr.O.P.Ahuja7 who had experience
in approval of courses on behalf of the regulatory
authority has also deposed that no organisation other
than the manufacturers would have the necessary
know-how of the aircraft whenever a new aircraft
is inducted into the airline.
From the statement of Capt.Bhujwala it
follows that he was not aware of the additional
delay in the engine acceleration when Alpha Floor
gave the acceleration order. Even Capt.Gopujkar
being his co-pupil would not have received this
infbnnation. From the report and deposition of
Inspector of Accidents it can be inferred that
the
this information was not available with the DGCA
until a query was raised after this crash. Even
the initial response of Airbus Industrie (Ex.55),
on which the Inspector' s report was based, was
incorrect. After further analysis, Airbus Industrie
wrote to DGCA on 12-4.-1990 revising their estimate
399

of the Alpha Floor trigger/activation delay range.
This did indicate that even Airbus Industrie did
not have a clear knowledge of the extent of this
delay on the date of the crash.
It is evident that Capt.Gopuikar and Capt.Fernandez
were ignorant about the time delay of 0.8 to
1.2 seconds beyond the normal acceleration time if
alpha floor gave the thrust increase order. Evidence
of Capt.Gupta who was also trained at Toulouse stated
that there was no difference between alpha floor
triggering and its activation. The depositions
of witnesses on behalf of Airbus Industrie clearly
indicate that they were not quite aware of the
delay between triggering of alpha floor and its
activation. In fact, at an earlier stage, the
time difference between the two was stated to be
0.5 seconds (vide Ex.1 -page 57). But during
the course of the present investigation it came
out that the delay may be between 0.8 to 1.2 seconds.
It is obvious that Aeroformation was not
aware of this delay at all and consequently the
trainees would not have been made aware of this
delay. The engine takes 8 seconds to develop full
power on receipt of the command. The pilots
seem to be under the impression that alpha floor
would activise the engines fully in 8 seconds,
now it is found that it would take about 8.8 seconds
to 9.2 seconds for the engine' to develop acceleration
after alpha floor is triggered. It is absolutely
400

necessary for the pilots to know this important
feature.
From the DFDR data it can be seen that CM1
0
has moved SSPPC from -5.20 at time 320 all the
way to -16.te at time 323 and -16.47° ( run aft
limit) recorded at time 324 seconds. Thrust lever
back up movement has come only later. This corres-
ponds to the explanation of FBS 8, item 16 regarding
demonstration and observation of alpha floor. He
has also used the words ' backed up by the pilot
moving the thrust levers to TOGA . If this was
the way pupils have been trained, CM1 pulling
the sidestick first and later moving thrust levers,
appears to be normal. "If Capt.Fernandez had
known about this delay, would he have moved thrust
levers earlier to TOGA when he started pulling
the sidestick control to full aft position?" is
a valid doubt that arises because this would
have probably saved the aircraft from the disaster.
If thrust has been given iv moving the thrust
lever at 320 seconds by 328 seconds, engines would
have certainly developed full power/acceleration,
thereby lifting up the plane at 328 seconds,
instead of allowing it to touch the ground by
329.9 seconds. It is also quite possible that
Airbus Industrie or Aeroformation bad never
visualised the situation wherein the mode of
idle/open descent gets engaged at a very low
altitude on short finals ( fbr whatever reasons)
401

creating a serious safety hazard, as it occurred
in this aricraft. If they had ever imagined this
situation, organisations like Airbus Industrie or
Aeroformation would have introduced this situation
in a profile during simulator training or they
would have taken action to see that this mode
engagement could never occur on short finals. Though
a modification has been launched, Indian Airlines
should ensure that all their pilots are given
a demonstration of the disastrous consequences of
this mode engagement at a critical stage on the
simulator and check fbr their reaction on every
proficiency check or recurrent training till such
time all the aircrafts are modified. Future
conversion training may consider this profile.
Indian Airlines should also very carefully
evaluate with the manufacturer and DGCA the
advantages of introducing manual thrust operation
whenever manual flight is conducted on the A-320.
The Government of India, constituted a
special committee in February, 1990 to evaluate
the state of preparedness of Indian Airlines for
the safe operation of Airbus A-320 aircraft. The
Chairman of the committee was Air Marshal 6.S.Ramdas
AVSM , VII, VSM o f the In di an Air Force. The
committee has examined among other things:
Adequacy of the norms, the training programme
( a)(cid:9)
of the flight crew and its efficient implementation
having due regard to the changed technology required
for safe operation of A-320 aircraft.
402

(b)(cid:9) The system followed by Indian Airlines for
a qualitative evaluation of the flight crew.
( c)(cid:9) Adequacy of training imparted to the aircraft
maintenance personnel fbr efficiently maintaining
and servicing the new technology A-320 aircraft.
(d) System followed by Indian Airlines for a
qualitative evaluation of the aircraft maintenance
personnel.
This expert committee has already submitted
its report and recommendations to the Ministry
of Civil Aviation and it is entirely unnecessary
fbr this Court to go into the matters considered by
the said expert committee.
403

?.B EXEMPTION FROM 100 HOURS FOR(cid:9) ENDORSUIENT
1. One of the incidental questions came up per
to the exemption granted by the DGCA for
the Command Endorsement of a pilot. Normally a
co-pilot with an experience of 100 hours in the
Particular type of aircraft only will be considered
ibr the Command Endorsement. Whenever new aircrafts
are introduced it is not possible for the operator
to have with it such pilbts•with 100 hours of
flying experience in that type of aircraft. In such
a situation experienced pilots in other aircrafts
and who are trained as co-pilots in the new
aircrafts are considered for Command Endorsement
upon the exemption being granted by the DGCA in
That
this regard. L such an exemption was granted to
several pilots when A-320 was introduced has been
questioned as improper. The suggestion implied
in this abjection was that lack of 100 hours
experience as- a co-pilot in A-320 resulted in an
insufficient experience for the pilot to become
the Pilot-in-Command (for short IPIC1 ). In
respect of several pilots Indian Airlines sought
the exemption from the DGCA having regard to
the shortage of the experienced pilots to fly
A-320. It is in evidence that this is an usual
practice followed certainly in India but elsewhere
also. However, the DGCA while granting exemption
would consider the advisability of granting
PIC endorsement after ,dispensing with the

requirement of 100 hours flying experience. Mr.Ahuia,
witness No.26,was exanined on behalf of the DGCA.
This witness stated that Indian Airlines sought
exemption for 72 pilots. But actually exemptions
were granted only to. 53 pilots. This exemption was
granted based on the flying experiences of the
pilots. The witness stated that " It was granted
only to 53 pilots based on their flying experience
and pilots and PIC experience on Boeing 737 aircraft.
Pilots having a total flying experience of more
than 8500 hours, total PIC experience of 5500 hours
and a total PIC experience on Boeing 737 aircraft
of more than 2500 hours were exempted from the
requirement of 100 hours" (page 258). When similar
exemption was sought for another 41 pilots DGCA
asked the Indian Airlines to re-examine the
request taking into consideration the available
number of PIC rating who have complied with the
requirement of 100 hours of co-pilot experience and 10
consecutive satisfactory route checks. Only
14 more pilots were exempted. The DGCA also
examined the performance of the pilots during
training at the Aeroformation before considering
the exemption question; that is why 5 pilots were
denied the exemption. Capt.Fernandez was granted
exemption by the order dated 12-2-1990 along
with 13 others. By that time Capt.Fernandez
had already gained experience of 68 hours of
flying as a co-pilot in A-320. Before the grant
of PIC endorsement eliery co-pilot will have to
405

(cid:9)(cid:9)
undergo mandatory 10 consecutive route checks.
Mr. Atli a also has explained the manner in which
the exemptions were granted on earlier occasions
also.
2.(cid:9) Capt.Gupta, who deposed on behalf of ICPA,
himself is a pilot in A-320. At the time of
deposition he had an experience of 300 hours of
flying in A-320. Earlier when exemption was
sought fbr him from the requirement of 100 hours
of flying to enable him to obtain PIC endorsement
it was not granted. He is aware of the revan.
He stated that he had only about 2460 hours of
flying experience and not 2500 hours of flying
Hoeing 737. According to him that was the main
consideration while granting exemption. Capt.Gupta
earlier held PIC endorsement fbr Boeing 737 also.
3.(cid:9) It is clear that DGCA and the Government
applied nnifbrm standard while granting the
exemption. The experience gained in other aircrafts,
even though certain systems may be different,
cannot be held to be irrelevant. The flying
experience certainly counts whether in one aircraft
or the other. However, when new aircraft is
introduced the pilots will have to be trained in
the new system. That does not mean that whenever
a new aircraft is introduced and the pilot on
being trained should necessarily undergo the
experience of 100 hours of flying as a co-pilot
irrespective of the background of the concerned
pilot.(cid:9)
406

7.0(cid:9) REGARDING SNAGS
In his report Ex.1 Mr.Satendar Singh has
referred to an unattended snag regarding PACK-2.
According to the Inspector this snag was being
carried fbrward from 12th February, 1990 till the
date of the accident end no action seems to have
been taken. It was observed by the Inspector
that carrying fbrward of those snags required that
the aircraft should not be flown above 31,000 feet.
But on the date of the accident, while cruising
the aircraft was at 33,000 feet. The other complaint
about soma seat lumbar vertical adjustment was
not highlighted at the time of investigation by
the Court.
Charles DI Souza was exdnined by the Indian
Airlines. He is a Flight Manager. He was examined
in the place of Capt.Tandon who was ill. This
witness however ;stated that he fully endorsed the
statements in. the affidavit of Capt.Tandon as he
was personally. aware of the facts stated therein.
The snag referred in the report Ex.1 arose during
the flight IC-669 and 670. This witness states
that he had met the pilot who was in charge of
those flights and he did not complain of any snag
referred in Ex.1. The snag was also not communicated
on the company channel. There was no special
report about it. The company was not at all
aware of the snags. The snag sheet will go to
the Engineering Department and if any incoming
407

pilot finds the snag he would pass on the information
in the company' s channel, which in turn would pass
it on to the Engineering Department. Mr.G.Venklateshwar
Rao, Superintending Aircraft Engineer, was also
examined by the Indian Airlines. According to him
no snag was found in the aircraft in question from
13th Feburary. His job was to do the transitional
checkings. The aircraft was in Bangalore on
13th February and he had checked it. Mr.Ramachandran
Raghunathan was examined as witness No..27. He is
a Superintending Aircraft Engineer stationed at
Bombay. He had checked VT-EPN on 12th February
personally. As he was required to do the transit
check he went through the pilot' s defect report
( for short sPDR') and noticed the snag reported
as "PACK-2 unserviceable". He got it confirmed
from ECAM page. Thereafter he rectified the
snag by re_ setting the computer by re-eyeling
the circuit breakers. Thereafter he checked the
operation of the PACK-2 system and found it serviceable.
This he confirmed also by setting the ECAN page.
Thereafter he counter signed the PDR page. He has
identified his initials. According to him the
Clerk inadvertantly stated in the computer sheet
by making the entry that this snag was carried
forward. There was no serious cross-extinination
of this witness at all. In fact it can be held
that he was not at all cross examined by any one
(cid:9)
seriously.
408

In the circumstance it is clear that the
material on record establishes that PACK...2 was
serviceable and the Inspector of accidents was
not properly infbrmed of the situation and obviously
he was misguided by the computer sheet.
409

7.1) ALPHA FLOOR PI()TECTION
The witness for the Airbus Industrie (Dar
short AI) Mr.Guyot deposed that the purpose of
installing alpha floor system was to protect the
aircraft against the wind shear condition and that
alpha floor system was not a mandatory item for
certification purpose. The witness also stated
that it is not included in the minimum equipment
list because it is not mandatory. This witness,
however, stated that in the instant case the delay
between 0.5 to 1.2 seconds in the triggering of
alpha floor protection was of no consequence
because it had to be applied at least 3 seconds
before the effective triggering of alpha floor.
This system is part of the auto thrust system
and according to him in the instant case it
triggered at time frEme 323.1 seconds. According
to him the time available between the triggering
of the aPiltia—r1x^,or ant-I—the—first touch down was
about 6.7 seconds. At a later stage be indicated
that there will be a delay' of 3.8 seconds for the
alpha floor to become effective because 3 seconds
411 have to be filtered to give an accurate
value of the angle of attack to trigger alpha
floor. He clarifies that the advantage of the
full power is provided. This is obviously because
the angle of attack gets automatically varied
during wind sheer conditions.
410

Capt.Gordon Corps, a Test Pilot of AI, stated
that"this system which is fitted uniquely to all
airbus aircraft: automatically applies ftill
thrust when activated. It was activated in the
Bangalore accident by a combination of angle of
caused
attack and the pilots stick position which
the advanced the operation of the system".
Mr.Satender Singh, the Inspector of Accidents,
who held preliminary enquiry stated befbre the
Court that he was infbrmed by the AI that the
delay in the triggering of alpha floor was only
0.5 seconds but subsequently he was informed
that the delay may go upto 1.2 seconds.
Capt.Gupta, in his evidence, suggested that
the pilots were under the impression that this
alpha floor protection would be available to
them and therefbre they did_not react to push
the thrust levers on the date of the crash even
when they realised that the plane was going down.
He indicated in his deposition that this protection
was not available below 100 feet altitude. He
gave the impression that there was no difference
between triggering and activation of alpha floor.
From the material on record two inferences
are possible:
(I)(cid:9) Generally the pilots reposed faith in
the alpha floor system and that they were not
specifically told not to rely upon it and that
it was meant mainly fbriwind sheer protection.
411

(ii)(cid:9) The delay in activation of alpha floor
after its triggering was not known to the pilots.
In fact AI itself was not quite certain about the
time factor governing the functioning of thid
system. If pilots had been specifically told
and warned that this system requires a minimum
of 1.2 seconds before it transmits thrust increase
order to the engine, the pilots probably would
have directly used thrust by pushing the thrust
levers rather than acting on the sidesticks.
Just before the crash CM1 tried to activise this
system instead of pushing the throttles to increase
power of the engines. This again indicates the
erroneous faith developed by the pilot in this
system. From Mr.Guyot's evidence one cannot be
certain of the time required to activise this
au&telm_ 11111, fTerator of this aircraft and the
pilots should be properly instructed and advised
ab-ut this system and its limitations.
412

7.E COCKPIT ATNOSPHEM
CVR conclusively establishes that the two
pilots have been totally cordial through out the
flight. Capt.Gopujkar has taken great pains to
explain various aspects of this aircraft' s handling
to Capt.Fernandez as this was his first route check,
.All procedures have been followed, all check
lists have been carried out. When CM1 asked for
go around during. alt star at DFDR seconds 232 it
was not set by CM2 knowing the implications and
he guided CM1 to select vertical speed. Landing
checks were carried out after passing below
1500 feet as Airbus Industrie has provided the
landing check list on the ECAM only after passing
below that height, above ground. The call fbr
700 feet rate of descent by CM1 at DFDR seconds 294
(or near about) was correct, as aircraft had
come to the correct Epproacn profile. They have
also followed heading instructions and come on to
final, closer than 7 DME which is not very unusual.
Capt.Dhujwala during his cross examination had
stated on page 2 that Capt.Gopujkar adopted
himself to the new technology very well and at
no time he was critical of the same. Capt.Gopujkar
was an Instructor in Boeing 737 and a check pilot
on A-320. He used to take a lot of pains to
teach the trainees. His approach and attitude
towards the trainees were quite helpful. The
trainees used to be quite comfortable with
Capt.Gopujkar". It should be noted that
413

the above statement has come from a long term
close associate, who joined Indian Airlines in
1969 along with Capt.Gopujkar, trained on HS-748
when Capt.Gopujkar was his batchmate, later when
being trained on Boeing 737 Capt.Gopujkar was
again his batchmate. Both of them underwent
induction course together and in July,1989 when
they went to Toulouse for A-320 training they
were again batchmates.
Capt.Gopujkar and Capt.Fbrnandez were conversing
about their personal food habits, medical check
up, etc. (between crash seconds 1439 to 1353) and
at 07:17:46 hours CM2 asks whether CM1 had matches
(obviously to smoke, which is not prohibited at
that time frame). The theory propounded by
Capt.Gordon Corpns that the relationship between
the two pilots was stiff and CM2 was conducting him-
self as, an examiner of CM1 and cockpit atmosphere
was not smooth is totally unacceptable. It was
pointed out that CM1 (Capt.Fernandez) did not
insist that some of his requests for selections,
such as , go around of 6000 feet were complied
with by CM2 and thereby he failed in his task
as CM1. But it has also come on record that most
of such requests were out of time and when CM2
reminded CM1 of the correct procedure Civil must
have accepted the suggestion. As the selection
of go around 6000 feet sought by CM2 at 260
DFDR seconds (7:32:08 hours), it is seen that
414

CM2 was busy with the

415

7.F ALT STAR
There is a peculiarity referred as alt star phase
in the course of the flight by A-320. Whenever the
aircraft is about to reach the selected altitude,
the aircraft will enter alt star zone. This is also
called altitude capture phase. The aircraft would
not change its mode from this phase unless the
pilot takes certain action, if necessary, to change
the vertical speed or the ,further altitude to be
attained by the plane. It is said that during alt star
phase, to revert from speed/vertical speed mode
to climb open climb or idle open descent mode
pilot has to take only one action, namely, selecting
different altitude. In case pilot wishes to change
from idle open descent to speed vertical speed
during alt star phase, two actions are necessary:
(1) selection of vertical speed by dialing
vs
knob and
(ii) pulling the V/S knob.
During alt star phase FMA would display
alt star. During this phase vertical speed cannot
be selected as the aircraft is already in the
course of capturing the selected altitude. Therefore,
to select a fresh vertical speed, the FCU altitude
will have to be re-selected to get out of alt star
phase and then select vertical speed. Broadly
this is what I learnt about this phase.
416

No publication of the Airbus Industrie explains
this alt star phase clearly. According to the ICPA
and its witness Capt.Guptat Airbus Industrie has
no convincing answer regarding the problem posed
by alt star phase. According to ICPA, during the
alt star phase if the vertical speed knob is pulled,
there would be a momentary or transitory change of
mode showing vertical speed. This will not result
in a permanent selection of V/S knob and it
immediately disappears. After V/S knob is 'released
this alt star phase once again gets engaged. ICPA
asserts that during Eat star phase selection of
V/S knob can only be achieved by the functions
of two knobs by operating both the speed knob
and the altitude knob of FCU.
The =following questions and answers in the
deposition of Capt.Guyot are relevant here:
Q. During alt star could vertical speed be reset?
A. Yes it is possible but it was not so.
Q. I put it to you that vertical speed cannot
be reset at alt star zone?
A. I do not agree with the suggestion.
Q. The vertical speed cannot be selected directly
during alt star without resetting the altitude
iv FCU?
A. That is-not so. When you are in alt star if
417

you pull the vertical speed knob you synchronise
the indicated vertical speed with actual. vertical.
speed of the aeroplane then thereafter dial
the knob to the vertical speed descend. If you
are not in alt star and if you are in vertical
speed then to alter the vertical speed the
knob will have to be turned without pulling it.
Q. I am suggesting to you that if the aircraft
is in the alt star mode the only way in which
vertical speed selection can be made effective
is to ensure that aircraft wires out of alt star
mode i.e., by changing the altitude on the FCU?
A. I do not agree with this. When you are in
alt star mode you can select vertical speed
nu
without changing altitude.
Again when this subject was posed at a later stage
the witness said:
Q. Refer to photos 2 series and please explain
as to how vertical speed can be selected when
the aircraft is in alt star?
A. According to the FCOM reference No.1.11.30 page
36 equivalent to page 39 it is said on the top
of the page "disengagement" that ALT ACQ can
be disengaged by selecting another longitudinal
mode. The vertical speed mode is a longitudinal
mode. What you to do to reengage the vertical
speed mode when you are in ALT ACQ mode is to
pull the vertical (speed knob and at this time
418

the vertical speed mode will be synchronised
with the actual vertical speed of the aeroplane
and the value will appear in the vertical speed
selected window. As the aeroplane is on the
way to capture the selected altitude, after a
few seconds, the aeroplane will revert again
in ALT ACQ and you have to pull again the knob
if you want to re-engage the vertical speed,
then you will keep definitely the vertical
speed when the aeroplane will achieve the
altitude HOLD and you can continue in vertical
speed without reselecting lower altitude on
the FCII. During the approach of VT-EPN in
Bangalore when the aeroplane was in alt star
at time 292, 293 and 294 on the DFDR, the
aeroplane was in alt star and speed mode.
If the crew had been trying to reselect
vertical speed during these 3 seconds, we
would have seen on the DFDR that the auto
thrust speed select parameter would have remained
at 1 value, that means in speed mode instead
to go to thrust idle mode.
This witness admitted that the explanation
offered by him about the vertical speed selection
during alt star was not found in any of the
publication of the Airbus Industrie. Capt.Guyot
was not prepared to rely on the test that may be
conducted in the simulator since he was not aware
of the simulator at Hyderabad.
419

Cept.Oordon Corps was also examined at length
on this question. The following extract from his
deposition would speak fbr itself:
Q. Please explain how vertical speed is set when
the plane is in alt star?
A. The vertical speed knob is pulled perhaps
more than once before the mode remains engaged.
Q. Please refer to photographs, collectively
marked as Ex.114 — 2 and M. How do you set
the vertical speed when the aircraft Ls in
the situation described in the PFD in the
said photographs?
A. When the vertical speed knob is pulled the
window will read the instantaneous vertical
speed and after a short period of time the
mode will revert to speed alt star.
Q. How long does alt star normally last?
A. It is a function of rate of descent. It may
be 12 to 18 seconds. But if the rate of
descent is very low it could be still shorter.
When the knob is pulled for example in
the very first second of alt star, the
vertical speed will be set and will then
revert to alt star. The alt star will continue
until the height is captured. When the aircraft
reaches the altitude it will hold that
altitude and it will be in the alt hold mode.
The vertical speed will not be set though it
would-have been set earlier .`'or(cid:9) short pertod.
420

Q.
Sol
by setting the vertical speed during alt
star you are referring to the movementary and
transitory phase?
A. Yes.
Q. Have you personal experience of setting vertical
speed during alt star?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you remember how long the setting remained?
A. For a few seconds.
Q. I put it to you that this can never be construed
to be setting of vertical speed during alt star
at all and that you are unfortunately reduced
to justify a stand which is not really
justifiable?
A. I do not agree with that.
As the learned Counsel lir.Vahanvati suggested
the mode explained by Capt.Gordon Corps is not a
mode at all to select the vertical speed, this
witness admits that during alt star phase the process
of selecting vertical speed(cid:9) have to be a
repetitive action till the end of the alt star
phase. His answer reflects an element of obstinancy
to establish that vertical speed can be set during
alt star phase even though it ismovementary.W hat
is the purpose of such a selection to regulate
the flight in unundersiandable.
421

It was argued on behalf of the Airbus Industrie
that alt star phase will be in display on several
occasions during any training period and therefbre
the pi lots will b fully aware of it. But there
is no single piece of evidence to establish that
the trainee pilots were instructed as to how vertical
speed can be selected during alt star phase. Even
the expert pilots of the manufacturer are incapable
of giving a precise answer to the problem. Nothing
was elicited by the learned Counsel for the Airbu3
Industrie from the India0 pilots who were in the
witness box as to their knowledge about this
alt star phase.
It should be a matter of grave concern to
the Indian Airlines and it should closely examine
this question and find out whether its pilots
have fully understood the implications of alt star
phase. It is also a matter for the DGCA to examine
whether the trainees were properly instructed on
this question. The manufacturer should take care
to explain this alt star phaSe in greater detail
to impart precise knowledge on this question to
those who are concerned with the matter.
422

7.G STALL yABNI;NG
1. In conventional aircraft, whenever the
angle of attack increases and approaches the stall,
a warning called the "Stall Warning" is provided.
A pilot would instinctively push the throttle levers
forward to increase engine thrust on the onset
of such warning.
Airbus Industrie has taken a definite,
unequivocal stand thEit this aircraft A-320 does
not require a stall warning because it would never
stall.
2. On occasions when computer system
protections get degraded to an extent wherein
aircraft flight control operation would be on
par with a conventional aircraft Airbus Industrie
have nrovid d an audio 'STALL' warning. At this
time such a warning is mandatory.
3. Crash of VT-EPN has demonstrated that in spite
of all protections against stalling, an alarming
loss of speed well below the approach speed
(normally magenta speed) would be disastrous.
Some warning system, such as the stall warning,
which would bring an instantaneous corrective
reaction by the pilots would be useful towards
accidents prevention.
4. At present pilots are required to watch
the low speed display in the airspeed scale in
this aircraft. As auto_ thrust is normally active
pilots have to take remedial action if speed drops
423

below V approach. Speed trend indicator also has
to be observed. There is no special warning to
remind the pilot about a dangerous loss of speed
below the required approach speed. Low speed display
is not recorded on DFDR.
5. In the instant case, serious allegations
were made that the pilots failed to monitor speed
during approach. Those who have reposed faith in
the pilots contend that these pilots would not have
failed to monitor speed and the low speed display
in the cockpit. They attribute the fall in the
speed to the display system. If for any reason,
the pilots were in a state of confusion, the
possibility of the pilots ignoring the movement
of the low speed colour display indicating speed
loss cannot be ruled out. But this needs that
both pilots are confused enough for the low speed
display not to register in their mind. Calmness
in the voices of the pilots recorded by the CYR
does not show such confusion. A warning similar
to stall warning if was available between DFDR
seconds 312 to 320 would have woken them up even
if such a confusion had existed. If the warning
between these time frames had resulted in the
pilots pushing the thrust levers forward, most
probably the crash would not have occurred.
6. It was pointed out that too many varieties
of warnings may lead to confusion by themselves.
The question is which (kind of warning is more
424

important during the critical stages of a flight.
The manufacturer and others interested in the subject
and safety may consider this aspect.
7. Capt.Gordon Corps, however, states that if
the conventional, aircraft is compared to the situation
of this VT-EPN, the stall warning would have occurred
when air speed 'was about 106 knots. This would
have been only after 323 seconds DFDR time and no
useful purpose would have been served, as it was
within 8 seconds of the crash. One possible answer
to this is, to prevent such future accidents,
prepone the timing of the stall warning to an
earlier stage when the speed falls below 120 knots,
when magenta speed is at 132 knots (as in the case
of VT-ITN). In this case it would have been at
DFDR time frame 312 to 313 seconds. Incidental-1Y,
in the flight test carried out at Toulouse with
Capt.C.R.S.Rao, one of the Assessors on board,
stall warning had occurred at 120 knots under direct
law operation with the aircraft weight and C.G.
close to VT-Errli andtatitude close to Bangalore
elevation.
This is a matter for the researchers of the
manufacturer and the regulatory authorities to
consider and locate the exact timing for the warning
against speed fall to occur, in the light of
experience gained froni this crash.
425

7.H REGARDING INSPECTOR OF ACCIDENT
Ex.l is the report of the Inspector of Accident.
Immediately after the accident the DGCA appointed
Mr.Satendra Singh. Director of Air Safety, as the
Inspector of Accident under Rule 71 of Aircraft
Rules, 1937. He immediately took the inspection work.
On 17th February, notification was issued directing
a fbrmal investigation of the accident under Rule 75
and the Court was appointed with the Assessors.
Under Rule 71(2) the investigation by the
Inspector is to be private, while Court' s investigation
under Rule 75 is a formal investigation to be held
in open Court.
Under Rule 74(4) any person desirious of making
a representation concerning the circumstances or
causes of the accident may do so in writing to the
Inspector. Inspector has certain powers to summon
any person and exarine such a person as per Rule 72.
His report is to be submitted to the DGCA.
The manner of the investigation held by the
Inspector we criticised before me by one or two
participants; it was contended that he prepared
his report in a hurry and submitted it by 31st
March,1990 (within six weeks of the accident) and
that it was incomplete and he failed to discharge
his functions as per the Rules. This criticism
is unwarranted. Within a few days of Inspector'
426

appointment, the Court. of Inquiry was announced.
The Court' s powers are wider and certainly its
status required the Inspector not to come in the
way of Court's investigation. He had to avoid
a parallel investigation. Moreover, as is usual
in such circumstances, he sought my permission to
continue 'his investigation and agreed to complete
it within the time specified by me. An open
inquiry by a Court is always favoured than a private
investigation, especially when the Court is presided
over by a sitting JUdge. I was anxious to complete
the investigation early. Having regard to the
limited scope of the Inspector's investigation,
in the context of Court' s appointment, I asked
the Inspector to file his report by 31st March,1990.
He has adhered to the time limit imposed by
me; he had not even full six weeks time to complete
his investigation. He based his report on the
available material. It is to be noted that even if
the Inspector has power to summon and examine any
person, the relevant Rules do not provide for an
open enquiry and cross-examination of the persons
whom he examines. Therefore, his inquiry is in
the nature of—aninformal(cid:9) investigation.
The Inspector was examined as witness No.23
and he was cross-examined. He was questioned about
the propriety of his taking the assistance of
manufacturer of the aircraft, the Indian Airlines
and of Aero Engines and he replied that no proper
investigation was possible without the cooperation
427

of those who are connected with the manufacture
and operation of the aircraft. His report was
based on the investigations conducted by him,
assisted by several teams of officers and some of his
findings were based on the opinions given to him
by others, as in the case of his opinion regarding
fire fighting operations conducted by HAL after
the crash. I have based my conclusions on the
evidence placed before be. The report of the
Inspector, in fact, enabled some of the participants
to focus their attention to some aspects which,
but for his report would not have been noticed
by many.
A few criticised him for venturing into
adding his "findings" and "recommendations" in
his report, when Court is already seized of the
subject. Under Rule 71(5), the Inspector is
empo:yerpri to nOC.1 any observations and recommendations
i•Thich he may think fit with a view to preservation
of life and avoidance of similar accidents in
future. Therefore, it cannot be said that the
Inspector overstepped in adding "recommendations"
as part of his report-Ex.1 He did not actually
investigate on behalf of the Court) but while
investigating abided by the Court' s directive
to expedite his investigation to avoid parallel
proceedings - one in private and another in open Court.
His conclusions and his recommendations found in
Ex.l in no way binds the Court; Court may consider
them just like any oth4r material placed before
(cid:9)
428
the Court.

I•lhenever a Court of inquiry is appointed under
Rulo 751 the purpose of continuing the investigation
by the Inspector under Rule 71 is not clear to me.
A parallel investigation ought to be avoided. As
a practical solution, if the Inspector in a
particular case seeks Court' s permission to continue
his investigation, that cannot always avoid the
embarrassment to the Court. The findings of the
Inspector were published widely, even before the
Court had an occasion to consider the issues;
Airbus Industrie, one of the participants, in
this case even suggested that investigation by
the Court was unnecessary in view of the Report.
Aircraft Rules 1937 should be amended to
solve this anamoly, so that in future, conflicting
proceedings - one in private and another in
open Court, could be avoided.
The Inspector has not considered many
relevant questions such as the nature of the
training imparted-to-the-pilots and the procedures
for grant of exemptions while the new-aircraft
was inducted, the effect of the revised co-relation
of CVILDFDR done by CASB, the knowledge- of the
pilots as to the peculiarities of alt star phase
of
and the limited nature Lalpha floor protection.
May be, he was short of time.
Statutory investigation of this sort should
be conducted by an independent Authority and not
by an Officer of DGCA. ( An Officer of DGCA may
429

not be able to point out the mistakes committed
by his own department. Investigation should be
entrusted to a high powered body consisting of
those possessing knowledge in the relevant subjects
and who, at the initial stage of the investigation
itself, are in a position to know the areas of
investi gation.
An open Court enquiry to find out the cause
of the crash of this magnitude cannot be concluded
early. The initial fixation of a short duration
of three months to complete the inquiry while
constituting the Court, is an empty prescription.
Such a limitation itself is a burden on the Court' s
working; a tendency to hurry up may develop in
such a situation. If a Judge is appointed to be
the Court of inquiry there should not be any
prescription of time limit to complete the inquiry;
the Judge himself should be trusted to complete
the inquiry expeditiously.
430

7.1(cid:9) D.G.C.A.
During the course of the investigation of
this unfbrtunate accident, the functioning of
the Directorate General of Civil Aviation also
cane in fbr close scrutiny. The Directorate
General of Civil Aviation is a statutory body
like the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
of U.S.A. and the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA)
of the U.K., responsible fbr exercising regulatory
control on aviation activities to ensure all
round safety of operations. In the year 1971
1
the International Airports Authority of India
was carved out of the DGCA to look after the four
International Airports. Subsequently, in the
year 1986, National Airports Authority was carved
out of the DGCA to look after(cid:9)
the-rePaatning
domestic airports and also to exercise Air Traffic
Control.
While the Government carved out the N.A.A.
from the DGCA under the National Airports Authority
Act, it left the powers of the DGCA in tact
under the Aircraft Act and Rules. Nevertheless
DGCA was neither reorganised, strengthened or
modernised to cater to the regulatory role it was
expeoted to play. Under the Aircraft Act and
Rules, DGCA is expected to licence all Aerodromes.
But it has come to the notice of the Court that
the licence of the Bangalore Airport, which is
under HAL was not renewed since 1961. It is not
431

known whether DGCA is licensing other Airports in
the Country and renewing them after properly
ensuring their safety requirements.
The DGCA is apparently ill equipped to
undertake the vital responsibilities entrusted
to it under law. The truncated DGCA is now left
with regulatory functions relating to Airworthiness
Control, Licensing of Flight Crew and Engineers,
Investigation of Accidents and Incidents, Air
Transport Control and R & D activities. As is
obvious, while the Government has been attentive
the growth of air
to and spent huge sums for
carriers and airport authorities, hardly any
attention seems to have been focussed to improve
the functioning of the Directorate General of
Ciiirtviation-.---Modern sophisticated fly-by-wire
technology A_320 aircraft had been inducted in
the airline operations but the strength and
capability of the DGCA to exercise regulatory
control on operation of such sophisticated aircraft
it has remained
has hardly seen any improvement;
a totally neglected organisation with adhoc
arrangements to discharge its functions. While
regulatory functions continue to be with
all the
the DGCA, there is no infrastructure with the
DGCA to discharge some of the functions. As a result,
s
the Directorate General of Civil Aviation which i
supposed to be a watch dog of aviation activities
and ensures safety of the air passengers and
ir crafts, .is unable to lexercise independent control
a
432

on very vital aspects of its functions like training
and licensing of pilots and engineers.
Only after the unfortunate crash of the
Airbus A-320 at Bangalore on 14-2-1990, the
Government seem to have posted a full fledged
DGCA which post was kept vacant for long. There
is practically no control of the DGCA on Air
Traffic Control matters, which although regulatory
in nature, is being exercised by the National
Airports Authority. Air-travel safety should have
top priority. Safety of air-traffic includes
safety of all those who are likely to be affected
on the ground also by a major accident. The
concept includes the post-crash operations like
rescue operations and medical treatment. The
Government shoad reorganise, strengthen and
modernise the DGCA immediately by providing
it with properpersonnel, funds and other
wherewithal. All regulatory functions relating
to air safety including air traffic control and
licensing of aerodromes should be exercised by
the DGCA. The DGCA should play an effective
role in the selection of pilots for training in
advanced aircraft, preparing the syllabus fbr
training, monitoring the training and finally in
the evaluation and clearance of pilots for line
flying and for command endorsement. There
should be no relaxation of any regulation or
discipline in this regard .
433

Whenever a sophisticated aircraft in large
numbers, is inducted, a corresponding sophistication
of the airfields is also necessary, such as
installation of ZS in all Airports. This should
have been considered by the DGCA, it being the
regulatory Authority for air safety in India.
Similarly, the approach roads leading to
the parameters of the Airport should have been
visited to see that they are maintained properly
to enable the vehicles move fast during an emergency
During the court's visit with the Assessors, it
was fbund that the approach roads at HAL Airport
were not maintained properly and one is reminded
of kutcha village roads.
In the course of his deposition, the
Senior Manager (Aerodrome) HAL was not able to
tell with whom the keys of the gate were kept.
Similar ignorance was betrayed by the Deputy
Manager, Fire Force, HAL. This shows that
those responsible Officers did not care to find
1
out the custodian of the keys aven by 7th May, 1990
though the crash occurred on 14th Feburary. It
was their responsibility to find out the cause
for the delay in opening the gate. Obviously,
lack of a proper control and supervision of
these Officers seem to have lulled them to complacency.
Need to have an independent Authority to
enforce regulatory measures should be met at the
earliest.(cid:9) 434

PART- VIII
r
FINDINGS
1. The aircraft had a valid certificate of
Airworthiness and was maintained in accordance
with the aoproved maintenance schedules.
2. There was no defect reported, on the air-
frame, engines and their systems prior to the
ill-feted flight nor any defect, abnormality or
emergency reported during flight by the pilots,
till it crashed.
3. There was no apparent indication of any
abnormality of flying controls.
4. Investigation of the engines revealed
that the engines were developing Dower and were
at or near full nower when they sheared off
from the wings after hitting the embankment.
5. DFDR data reveals that there was no failure
of aircraft electrical, hydraulic, yaw damper
and cabin pressurisation and communications systems.
There was no smoke of fire warning. The GPWS
activated Sinx Rate warning four times from DFDR
seconds 324 onwards.
6. The wrecxage examination revealed that
the slats were extended, flaps were in full down
nosition, spoiler lever armed and landing gears
were down thereby indicating landing configura-
tion of the aircraft.
435

7. Weather conditions were clear.
8. All security procedures nrior to commence-
ment of the flight were carried out and there is
no evidence of sabotage.
9. The pilots were annropriately licensed to
undertake the flight.
10. Cent. C.A. Fernadez was flying the aircraft
from the L.H. seat as CM.1 and it was his -first
route check for command endorsement under suner-
vision of Cant. Gonuikar, Check Pilot of A.320
aircraft.
11. Although VOR-DME annroach was discussed
between the pilots, it is not clear whether
VOR-DNE let down nrocedure as ;Per Jenoessen
Manual was followed. From 42 NM to 7 NM the
aircraft was under surveillance of Bangalore Air
Route Surveillance Radar and from 7 NM onwards
indications are that visual an'- roach or a mixture
of visunl with Non-nrecession Annroach was being
followed.
12. The aircraft reported R/W in sight when
it was 7 NM west on left base of R/W 09 and.
was cleared to land by Bangalore Tower at
13:02:17 hrs. which was acknowledged by the
flight crew.
13. Landing checks "ere comnleted but go around
attitude was not set. Similarly, Flight Directors
436

were not nut, off at the time of landing checks.
14. The aircraft was slightly higher and also hav-
ing higher sneed when landing clearance was given
but thereafter it came to ironer nrofile for annroach
to land.
15. At 13:02:42 /-295 DFDR Time Frame - i.e., about
35 seconds before the time of first imnact with the
ground,7, the aircraft was at a height of 512 feet AGL.
Since then it started coming down below th9 rrofile
and aircraft sn,ked was falling below the target an-
proach sneed. There is no specific indication that
the crew monitored the sneed and height since then.
16. The relationship between the pilots was quite
cordial.
17. When Cant. Fernandez (CM.1) was nulling the
side stick control off to Ditch un the nose and
arrest the sink rate, the aircraft entered the
Alnha protection zone (high incidence nrottction)
at 318 seconds end finally at 323.1 seconds Alnhe
floor (thrust protection to increase thrust to
tare off rower) was triggered and in all Probability
at 323.9 seconds (or at 324.3 seconds), Alnha floor
was activated by Cant. Fernandez taking the side
stick movement to full beck position.
13. Airbus Industrie was not aware of the exact
delay between Alrha floor triggering and its
activation due to signal transmission through
a number of computers and the delay seems to
437

have been investigated only after the accident.
Even now there is no definite knowledge of the
exact delay which may vary from 0.8 to 1.2
seconds. None was aware of this delay factor
so far.
19. Basically Alpha floor functioning is built
as a nrotection against wind shear, but the
pilots seem to be undef the impression that the
protection from this system will be available
to increase power of the engines in any emergency
without any time delay and a false sense of faith
has been reposed on this system.
20. This crash would not have harrened.
(a) if the vertical sneed of 700 feet
as asked for by Cant. Fernandez at
about DFDR 294 seconds had been selected
and airdraft'ned continued in speed/
vertical sreed mode;
(b) if both the flight directors had
been switched off between DFDR seconds
312 to 317 seconds, or
(c) by taking over manual control of
thrust i.e., disconnecting auto
thrust system and manually rushing
the thrust levers to TOGA (take off
go around) Position at or before
DFDR 320 seconds ( 9 seconds to first
imnact on golf cpurse).
438

21. In all nrobAbility one of the pilots
acted to nut off FD.2 by about TF.313 seconds,
but FD.2 failed to go off resulting in confusion
in the mind of Cant. Gopujkar.
22. There is nothing t3 show that the pilots
realised the gravity of the situation even after
the Radio Altimeter Synthetic call-outs of 400
feet, 300 feet and 200' feet.
23. Whatever be the exact timing of the throttle
moven,ent, it was too late en action to nrevent
the crash.
24. Alpha floor Protection was triggered at
323.1 seconds and got activated at 323.9 seconds
(or 324.3 seconds) which again was too late to
develop sufficient nower in the engines to prevent
the crash.
25. At DFDR seconds 329.9 the aircraft first
imnacted the golf course. At what point of time
6.125 'G' was exnerienced and whether its record-
ing by the DFDR was correct, are not decided. No
exPert witness was examined by anyone to explain
the nature of 'G' force and the manner in which
DFDR records the said force.
26. Soil testing report indicated that the first
touch down area was harder as compared to the
second touch clown point.
439

27. The aircraft bounced for nearly 1.194 seconds

38 to 40 seconds nrior to the first touch down
the aircraft was in nroper auto thrust sneed mode

and was descending in vertical sneed mode. At DFDR
seconds 292 altitude canture mode was activated indi-
cating that a selection on. the FCU panel close to I'4DA
of 3300 ft had been made at an earlier stage of the
flight.
35. Prior to 305 seconds, the aircraft went into idle
open descent mode. A conclusive finding as to what
pilots did at this point of time is not possible.
36. DFDR recording shows that auto thrust speed select
at 295
discrete changed status from 'l'to 10'/Secds. There is no
doubt that plane was in idle open descent
mode by 305
seconds, by which time the Plane
was at an altitude
lower than 400 feet Radio altitude.
37. The aircraft could not sustain the height and
sneed in the annroach profile because of fixed idle
thrust in idle oven descent mode.
38. The aircraft never went to speed mode thereafter,
though it was the most rroner mode for landing.
39. In all probability, for some reason the pilots did
not realise the gravity of the situation of idle/open
descent mode and being at a Radio altitude below 300
feet at DFDR TF. 205 seconds.
40. The ATC tape at Bangalore Airnort was found record-
ing the tower and annroach frequencies only and time
was not recorded.
41. The crash fire tenders of HAL Airnort must have rea-
ched the boundary wall of the airnort at the earliest
point of time. but, subsequently there was delay in open-
ing the' gate and reaching the fallen aircraft.
441

42. Cent. Fernandez had occunied L.H. seat after
more than 2 months of onerating as CM.2 from
RH seat without any simulator or aircraft training
nrior to change over.
43. The aircraft touched on its main wheels for
the first time in the Golf Course of Karnataka Golf
Association annroximately 2300 feet short of the
beginning of R/W 09.
44. During the short flight between fir'st and
second touch downs four trees1in line with the
two mnin gears and the two engines were broken
by the aircraft at heights from 10 feet to 7 feet
2 inches and the aircraft hit the ground on its
landing gear in a slightly right wing low altitude.
45. There was an explosion when fire commenced
and there was also a major fire, orward and aft
of the right wing.
46. RH rear door had been onened from outside
by nirnort fire services nersonnel when they
reached the aircraft.
47. Few Passengers escened through overwing
exits and through fuselage onenings created by
crash/exnlosion.
48. 86 passengers and 4 crew lost their lives at
the time of the accident. Two more died later
in hosnitels. 21 nassengers and one crew suffered
serious injuries.
442

49. 31 of 90 Passengers Who died at the time of
the accident have died due to shock as a result
of burns sustained.
50. 32 victims had injuries to lower limbs, 20 to
the head and 7 had thoracic injuries causing
possible nhysical inability to escene the fire
in time.
51. Cause of death of Cant. Gonujkar and Cant.
Fernandez. was due to shock as a result' of burns
sustained. Autopsy renorts indicated no fractures.
52. Tail section behind rear galley housing CYR
and DFDR and APU showed no signs of damage.
53. Though major part of fuselage was destroyed
by fire the RH nortion of cockpit structure Which
had the front wind shield, No.2 sliding window
(Direct Visiion window) and No.3 window survived
the fire though nartially burnt.
54. The RH No.2 sliding window was in an onenable
condition at the time of the crash.
55. A witness had seen a nerson hitting against
the cocknit RH side window before fire engulfed
the nlane.
66. All connuter units had suffered extensive
dauage.
.j7. Sneed dron from 132 Kts. to 106 kts. has taken
26 seconds from DFDR times 297 and 323 seconds.

58. Computers have not held the actual angle of
attack at design limit of 15° or at speeds of
Alpha max as indicated in FCOM. Actual angle of
attack has gone beyond and sreed has dropped below
the annronriate values.

60. The times of change of FNGC used FD mode pnd
GFC 1 bus (18) discrete status do not corresnond
to the time of CVR conversation of FDs to be nut
off and nutting them off.
61. Idle/oven descent mode of auto thrust system
has engaged some time after DFDR time 295 seconds.
The exact reason for this rode engagement cannot be
exnlnined or nroved because of non—availsbility of
FCU selected altitude data or 1CU controls selectiOn
data cn DFDR.
CP. Right bank' has been induced when CM.l nulled
side stick fully aft and Rudder has been used to
lift wing at DFDR times 323 and 327. Loss of about
7 feet has been attributed to this cause by Airbus
Industrie.
C3. CVR has shown no isign of nanic or anxiety about
444

sneed loss till CM.1 spoke - "Hey we are going
down". £here were no cells of speed deviation
though sneed was 106 kts. at DFDR time 323
seconds.
64. Low sneed disriny-on PFD on A-320 is excel-

65. Power awareness may be deficient in A-30
pilots when auto thrust is active, as even an
Airbus Industrie test pilot was not aware of nower
required during final anproach at 1000 FP} rate
of descent.
66. There is no warning if auto thrust brings
thrust to idle for whatever reasons during

not nart of the simulator rrofile training. This
indicates that no one may have visualised such an

kinetic energy into potential energy was nrevented.
Was this nrevention due to the computers is a
matter to be considered.
76. Landing mode of the flight controls may have
contributed during the last 3 seconds in the
prevention of conversion of kinetic energy into
notential energy.
76. It seems that Aeroformation simulator training
on simulator fitted with CFI; 56 engines has been
accented by the concerned denartment of the DacA
without obtaining full data on the simulator cana-
bility even though this had been thought of and
concern had been exnressed earlier during 1986-87
regarding use of en incompatible simulator even for
recurrent training and proficiency checks. No
additional stipulations had been prescribed after
this acceptance.
77. Part of the CA.40.B (J) check in case of both
these pilots was carried out on a simulator with
C1i1.36 engine data.
78. Recommendation for ainnroving Airbus Industrie/
Aeroformation instructors has been made .and
annroval granted without receiving confirmation of
A.320 PIC rating and A.320 PIC experience in the
case of two pilots.
79. The subject of Bangalore HAL Airnort holding
a Licence or not was not relevant and would have
in no way affected this crash.
447

30. All Primary and secondary flight controls
anpeared to have operated normally.
81. Increase of N2 RPM on slats extension on
VT-EPN was less than those recorded on Airbus
Industrie aircraft and two other Indian Airlines
aircraft.
82. The engines have operated normally throughout
and have not contributed towards the cause of this
accident.
83. Under conditions Prevailing and based on the
DFDR data and CVR transcript, the accident comenced
at an-roximately DFDR time 321 seconds. The air-`
craft had no chance of survival thereafter.
84. If. ILS was available at Bangalore for R/W 09
most nrobably, this accident would not have occurred.
85.. But for the severe fire, the loss of lives
would have been considerably less.

RECOM11.1:71TY1 TIMIS
1.(cid:9) Accident/incident investigation authority
should be totally independent of the DGCA and
al] organisations connected with aviation in
India. Only this can ensure an impartial and
unbiased investigation looking into the role of
every organisation connected with the accident/
incident includin,g the DGCA.
Whenever an investigation is ordered
under Rule 71 of the India Aircraft Rules, 1937
and later a formal investigation is ordered under
Hule 751 automatically the Inspector of Accidents
should only indicate the finding based on factual
evidence and no interpretation or recommendation
should be made to avoid embarassment to the formal
investigation.
3.(cid:9) A highly experienced pilot should always
be associated with the Tnsnector of Accidents
officially if he is from an engineering background
and the pilot's report should he recorded whenever
an airlinC accident is to be investigated.
DGCA should formulate procedures and
develop information formats which has to be
completed in all respects every time a new air-
craft is introduced into the airline to cover all
training aspects and exemptions/validations to
be granted.
450

(cid:9) DGCA should form a board of officers

competent to deal with all aspects of training
with if necessary senior experienced training
personnel from the airline to assist such a board
officially to evaluate the proposed training pro-
grammes prior to acceptance whenever a new air-
craft is introduced into the airline in the

to its contents.
23. Experienced aviation pathologists either
from Civil or Military Aviation should be made
use of in an advisory capacity. A large number
of copies of the above circular if sent to various
hospitals around airports could assist in wider

dissemination of information among the doctors
of the hospitals.

high angles of attack.
25. Some slides did not display whdn door

primary speed display may be considered. A
provision should be available to check this warning,
during the pilots pre flight check. Such warning
should be serviceable, for release of the flight.

evaluation of moving auto throttles giving feel
of thrust increase or decrease versus the static
thrust levers of the A-320 auto thrust system
using line pilots is recommended to establish
advantages and disadvantages.

31. Option of moving auto throttles is
desirable in all future aircrafts if static
auto thrust system similar to A-320 is to be
installed in such aircraft.
32. After gear down and below 2000 feet
radio attitude it is recommended that idle/
open descent mode should be indicated in flashing
red on the FMA associated with a single stroke
chime.
33. Airbus Industrie should evaluate the
nroVision of a feature, by which low thrust
level occurring, during final anDroach, even
on sneed mode due to gusty wind conditions, would
attract immediate attention of the nilots; if
it occurs very close to the ground it could lead
to unsafe situations.
34. It is recommended that the low range scale
of the EPR gauge upto 1.10 should be exnanded to
give a better indication by the needle of a low
thrust condition.
35. Airbus Industrie may look into nroviding
a range in red colour unto 1.02 CPR to Attract
pilots' attentionof a low thrust situation When
on final annroach.
36. Similar features as above could be evalu-
ated and nrovided for oneration in N1 mode.
457

37. It is recommended that the emergency
exit sliding window in the cockpit (direct vision
window) should have the operating handle in the
forward end to give a better leverage than at
nresent, so that it could be easily onened by a
comparatively frail lady pilot using any one hand
only. Indian Airlines may check with Airbus
Industrie if a retrofit modification is possible
for their nreseRt fleet and future airctaft.
38. Safety of onerations would demand that
Airbus Industrie execute the proposed modifications
of increased annroach idle by 2.5% N2 and auto thrust
mode changing to sneed mode when aircraft sneed drons
to VLS, as top-most priority modifications. Indian
Airlines should nursue the matter vigorously with
Airbus Industrie in co-ordination with DGCA.
39. Installation of a single master switch
conveniently located to switch off both FDs when
required is recommended; slave switches could be
used to switch them 'on' individually or renositing
of both switches centrally be considered.
40. A modification to nrevent auto thrust
mode change from sneed made to thrust mode
during Alt* just by change of attitude selection
is highly desirable. The mode change should
occur only by nulling the altitude knob after
change of altitude selection.
458

41. Airbus Industrie should clearly define in
their procedures and flight patterns the position
at which they need the flight directors to be put
off.
42. Airbus Industrie should immediately amend
A- 3m FCOM bulletin No.09/2 of June 1990.
43. Indian Airlines should introduce simulator
training session whenever a line pilot is required
to change his seat from the co-pilot seat to the
captain seat after a long period of operation from
the right hand seat even when this is for obtain-
ing 100 hours experience prior to PIC route check.
44. In the interests of quality of training
and safety, it is recommended that DGCA accords
approval for all the 100 hours co-pilot experience
to be obtained by a pilot slated for direct PIC
training on to any type from the left handpeat
only unddr the supervision of an approved check
pilot/flight instructor/examiner. If airline
needs to use these pilots from RH seat during this
training period pilot should be given simulator
training as PF from RH seat also.
45. operation of the cockpit emergency exit
windows (direct vision windows) either during pre
flight check by pilots prior to commencement of
their first lag of their series of flights or
during daily certification of flight by aircraft
459

maintenance engineers would ensure easy operation
of the window by preventing the seals from stick-
ing to the framework causing higher force require-
ments to open when need arises.
46. A re-emphasis regarding a 3 seconds delay
in alpha floor activation by dangle of attack in
case of windshear should be made to all A-320
pilots and Indian Airlines should recommend that
pilots should not wait for alpha flopr but react
on thrust levers immediately if an adverse situ-
ation is encountered.
47. It, is recommended that Airbus Industrie
and certification authorities to carefully re-
evaluate the limit of 15° angle of attack (alpha
max) was both simulator experiment and Airbils
Tndustrie flight test under direct law going to
slightly higher angles of attack have shown better
performance and reduced altitude loss.
4R.(cid:9) In view of the results of the test flight
at Toulouse it is recommended that, certification
authorities including DGCA should carefully evalu-
ate acceleration characteristics of an engine at
high angles of attack to give better information
to pilots as Airbus Industrie test flight has
demonstrated different acceleration characteristics
by the same two engines in the four profiles.
49.(cid:9)
With the drastic change in high bypass
460

turbo fan engine designs from the 1960's to the
present day and the acceleration characteristics
and net thrust developed during various stages
of acceleration of present day engines it is
recommended that certification authorities may
re-examine the existing engine acceleration
certification requirements.
50. Indian Airlines should include inadver-
tant engagement of IDLE/OPEN DYACFITT on short
final at heights very close to the ground as a
profile during simulator training of pilots be-
ing converted onto A-320 and also during re-
current training and proficiency checks till
such time all their A-320 aircrafts are modified
with the new proposed modifications.
51. As documentation supplied by aeroforma-
tione to a large number of Indian Airlines pilots
during training did not filly correspond to the
Indian Airlines aircraft (which was not according
to the minutes of the training conference) it is
necessary for Indian Airlines to update these
documents in co-ordination with Aeroformation.
52. Indian Airlines should include recovery
from a situation of low speed at idle thrust in
close proximity to the ground in their check
pilot training and instructors training on the
simulator.
461

53.(cid:9) It is recommended that all pilots in
India operating automated aircraft be advised that
in case of any malfunction of any auto pilot or
auto thrust systems or any engagement of undesired
mode occurs at altitudes below 1000 feet above
ground level manual control should immediately be
taken over and if considered necessary a go around
should be carried out. Ho critical investigation
or correction on the automated system should be
carried out at critical altitudes prohibiting the
idle/open descent mode below 1000 feet radio
altitude should be seriously considered.
54. Indian Airlines should very carefully
evaluate with the MCA and Airbus Industrie the
advantages of introducing manual thrust opnration
when manual flight is being carried out on the
A-320.
55. Indian Airlines should carefully evaluate
with Airbus Industrie the auto thrust behaviour
during gusty wind conditions when speed suddenly
increases beyond V-app and decreases at altitudes
below 200 feet AGL and adverse implications if
any to determine the limits of use of auto thrust
system. This may have to be evaluated in both
cases of nagenta speed or selected speed.
56. The U.V.recording and sound cepstrum
analysis 14,.-mla help to identify the voices, as well
as various other sounds; research and study of thP
462

science may be undertaken, so that in future
its benefit
would be available whenever necessary.
57. A 'Human Factor Research' centre may be
established to study and analyse Human Factors
in Aviation.
58. A careful study be made to evaluate the
advantages of having backward
facing passenger
seats with a shoulder harness towards improved
passenger survivability at the time of accident.
Such backward
facing seats may prevent the type
of head injuries, injuries to legs and hands,
arms etc., that occurred in this accident.
59. Due to severe fire developing with
hardly 3000 to 3300 icgs., fuel, burning completely
the interior, furnishing, ton of the fuselage
and
the floor of the cabin, DGCA should carefully
evaluate along with other certifying authorities
and manufacturers,
the feasibility of providing
oxygen cylinders for crew
and for passengers in
the least fire risk areas (well away from the fuel
tanks namely front and rear of the fuselage), with
a provision of a valve close to the cylinders which
would be closed at levels below 10000 feet. This
may help in delaying the spread of the fire in
comparison to the oxygen generators distributed
throughout the aircraft and may contribute to
saving more lives.

DFDR should record the selections made by

In the course of the investigation, the
assessors had occasions to study literature on
Human factors inflight; they also had the benefit
of holding discussions with Human factor experts
at NASA (WA). Based on their knowledge a useful
note is prepared, which I have included in this
part of the Report.
Similarly, certain simulator experiments
were conducted and flight tests held to collect
relevant data. These could not be directly used
in evidence due to practical difficulty. There—
fore the inferences drawn by the assessors cannot
be applied to arrive at a definite finding.
These data were indicative of certain 'trends',
and may be useful to continue the study regarding
matters stated therein. It is hoped that the
concerned persons like the manufacturers and the
Regulatory Authorities would undertake further
research on these matters in the interest of
future flight safety and improved performance.

The errors made by pilots are in principle
no different from those made by everyone else.
The use of the words "pilot error" has suggested
that somehow the nature of the errors made by
this kind of operatox is unique, that once an
465

accident could be attributed to this *cause",
then the problan was solved and the case be
filed. To many, this may not have been a
wholly
inconvenient procedure.
Page 27
The pilot error concept also focuses
rather more on what happened than why it happened
and so for this reason, too, it has beep unhelpful
in accident prevention activity.
Page 36
It is also possible to predict, as proposed
in what has been called Murphy' s Law, that if
equipment is designed in such a way that it can
be operated wrongly, then sooner or later, it
will be.
page 44
Training for a particular task will
reduce the incidence of errors, though it (cid:9) not
totally eliminate than. 0Yeriearning, which is
discussed has a notable effect in making a skill
`"ore- resistant to stress and error.

Traditionally, accident investigations have
been primarily concerned with determining what
happened and who carried legal liability. This
involved confirming that all those concerned were
licensed properly and that they had at the time

regulations. Once this had been determined, it
was usually assumed that those concerned had
the capacity to perform their allocated task
and if they did not do so, then blame could be
allocated, punishment and penalties inflicted,
claims settled and the case filed.
But increasingly, intelligent people are
asking, why. Why a properly qualified, highly
trained, medically fit, well paid person, failed
to perform his task as expected.

Direction of movement of the control

clockwise to increase the value and vice versa.

The very rcliability with which automated
systems normally perform provides the foundation
upon which over confidence and complacency are
built.
Inadequate Human Factors input in the early
467

stage of system and equipment design may finally
necessitate the use of complex normal and
emergency operating procedure which in turn may
increase the risk of human error. While the
true responsibility for the error in such cases
may go back to the original design, it is the
operator who is usually left "holding the baby".

But when the human is primdrily along just
for the ride, the chances for a human induced error
increase. Pilots have already reacted to
greatly
voicing fear of loosing their manual
automation by
flying skills. There will be future accidents due
468

to pilots trying to program their way out of
trouble, instead of deactivating automation and
flying under manual control.
Page 266, 267
The problem of human error in aviation has
turned out to be a difficult one both to understand
and to solve. Accidents are often catastrophic;
typically, little information is available from
which to piece together a complete or comprehensive
picture of causality. Errors are neither random
nor mysterious. They seem to be lawful in the
sense that they are predictable and that more humans
(even experts) tend to make errors that follow
certain patterns under a variety of circumstances.
Page 272
To develop solutions to the problem of human
error, whether they be better equipment, better
selection policies for flight crews, or better
training, we must be able to predict with some
certainty what conditions in flight are the most
likely to cause the types of errors which contribute
so disproportionately
to aviation accidents and
incidents.
Page 291
With modern flight simulators capable of
reproducing a wide range of operational conditions,
such training can be extremely effective in alerting
the crew to deal effectively with unlikely events
(Lauber & Foushee, 1981).
469

Page 296
The ability of a pilot to manually control
an aircraft is fundamentally limited by the handling
qualities and characteristics of the aircraft as
well as basic neuromuscular capabilities of the
human. The provision of information of the right
kind can greatly reduce control errors made even
by the most highly skilled pilots. Conversely,
without the proper information, even the most
highly skilled pilot may be helpless to effect
adequate control.
Page 297
Different classes of actions should have
dissimilar command sequence; this will make capture
and description errors less likely. Actions should
be reversible whenever possible; whenever the
consequences of an action are particularly significant,
the action should be made difficult to do, thus
tending to prevent unintentional performance.
22sa_2213221
Automation, which as we have seen can have
a very positive effect on both efficiency and safety,
can also have a depressing effect on safety. As
pilots are removed from an active role in flying
the aircraft, more and more incidents that can only
be termed "loss of situational awareness" are
reported.
470

Page 434
On the negative side, the digital systems
seem to invite new forms of human error in their
operation, often leading to gross blunders rather
than the relatively minor errors
which characterize
traditional systems.
Page 445
(cid:9) 6
Designers responded to pilot error by
attempting to remove the error at its source,
that is, to replace human functioning with device
functioning in Lheir view, to automate
human error
out of the system. But there were two flaws in
this reasoning; (I) the
devices themselves had
to be operated and monitored by the very humans
whose caprice they were designed to avoid, thereby
relocating but not eliminating human error; and
(2) the devices themselves had the potential for
generating errors that could result in accidents.
Page 453, 454
Many airlines have attacked the blunder
problem as a training matter. The importance of
training for the conduct of automated flight
cannot be overemphasized, but all too often
training departments become dumping grounds for
problems created by cockpit design and management.
If human factors engineering is done properly
at the conceptual and design phase, the price is
high, but it is paid only once. If training must

The rapid pace of introduction of computer
based devices into the cockpit has outstripped the
ability of designers, pilots, and operators to
formulate an overall strategy for their use and
implementation. The human factors profession is
struggling to catch up. The devices themselves
are highly reliable, but therein may lie the problem:
they are also dumb and dutiful.
Page 522
If an automated system does not provide
adequate feedback to keep the pilot informed of
an action taken, reason for the action, arl:' present
status, these become additional concerns for the
pilot.

It is of utmost importance that crew systems
and human factors design engineers play a strong
role in the development of new systems. If left
to their own devices, avionics and software engineers
in the most economical or
will mechanize systems
that may

however, may be illogical to the pilots who must

Laat
The large majority of accidents or incidents
occur as a result of errors that are commonplace;
many appear to be system induced.
Most of the serious errors that crew members
make are not first time occurren,,,)s. If error data
could be captured through a system which encouraged
crews to describe all errors in a timely fashion,
with the understanding that the information would
not be used in any manner to reflect on their
record, a valuable tool for accident prevention
would be found-
Page 558
The control of the autopilot system, termed auto-
flight control system (AFC'S), is the most complicated
and troublesome system from a pilot's standpoint.
The AFCS can automatically control airspeed, altitude,
descent and ascent, and track (ground path)
following through the autopilot, autothrottles,
vertical navigation system (VNAV), and lateral
navigation system (LNAV).. The problem that pilots
have with this new system is that there are
apparently too many options or modes of operation.
For instance, climbing to a higher altitude can be
made in three different ways automatically through
VNAV, vertical si_3d, or flight level change. Each
of these modes has different characteristics and
possible sources of error.

introduce the side stick
473

Thus far pilot reaction to the side stick controller
has been lukewarm because of the fear of losing the
"feel" of the aircraft. To the experienced pilot,
this feel is critical, as much sensory information
is gained from changes in
the aircraft attitude or
airspeed, even before it becomes evident on airspeed
or attitude instruments. The design of the side
stick controller permits the other pilot to override
control of the aircraft by using higher stick forces.
Many pilots are concerned that movement of one of
the controls might not be evident to the other pilot.
One advantage of the system is that it allows the
pilots an unobstructed view of the instrument panel.
C. THE PaihR OF AN OPEN MIND (by Ellen Langer)
(Extracts from an article by the noted Harvard
University Psychologist published in the July 1990
issue of the Header's Digest Indian edition pages
57 to 60).
The consequences of operating on automatic pilot,
range from the trivial to the catastrophic. The
examples that follow, demonstrate how- we cut off
our commonsense when we treat information as though
it were true regardless of circumstances.
Unfortunately, once people set their minds on
a single solutions they often fail to look for others.
Whenever you face a now problem, question all
your assumptions before mapping a course of action.
The consequences of becoming so used to one
way of doing things that we block out the present world
can be dire.

By forcing yourself to look more carefully for the
specific source of your dissatisfaction, you will
increase your potential for solving the problem.
2. HUMAN FACTOR AND THE PRESENT CRASH:
2.1. The subject of Human Factors have played
an extremely important role in this accident.
Capt.S.S.Gopujkar had over 10300 hours of total
flying experience of which nearly 7200 hours
were as Pilot-in-Command. He had flown as commander
on both H-748 and B-737 of Indian Airlines prior
to his conversion onto A-320. He was also an
instructor on B-737. Similarly, Capt.C.A.Fernandez
had over 9300 hours total flying experience with
nearly 5200 hours as Pilot-in-Command (which
included command experience of HS-748 and B-737).
Though these pilots had flown individually
as commanders of their earlier aircraft to amass
great wealth of experience, after recent conversion
onto this new A-320 aircraft, the aircraft has been
allowed to crash.—TheCVR has indicated a total
absense of panic till about 7 --t-45-8 seconds prior
to the crash.
The assessors to the Court of Inquiry
visited NASA AM[S at San Francisco during June, 1990,
where the assessors had discussions regarding Human
Factors Research, conducted oy NASA after the
introduction of Glass Cockpit airplanes. This
meeting was co-ordinated by Dr.R.Curtis Graeber of
the Aerospace Human Factors Research Division of NASA
475

on behalf of that organisation. Among the other
participants during these discussions were Dr.Charles
E.Billings, Dr.Everett A.Palmer, Dr.Barbara Kanki,
Ms.Barbara Townsend, Ms.Sheryl L.Chappell, Mr.Asaf
Degani and Capt.H.Orlady.
Dr.Greaber and Dr.Billings are world known
figures alongwith Dr.Wiener in Aviation Human
Factors Research. The other personnel who attended
the meeting have conducted research in various
ispects of Aviation Human Factors in respect of
flight crew operating modern technology aircraft.
Capt.H.Orlady is a retired airline captain with a
lot of jet transport flying experience in various
types of aircrafts who is assisting NAbA in their
studies.

2.2.(cid:9) A few questions td be considered are:-
(1)(cid:9) Why two highly experienced pilots have
permitted the speed to drop below the required
managed speed of 132 knots viz., an extent of 26
knots (i.e.) upto 106 knots without either of than
observing-the loss of speed or commenting about
the loss of speed.
(ii) Why was there no anxiety or panic till ?
to 8 seconds prior to the crash.
(iii) If conventional (earlier technology), air
speed indicator had been provided with a selectable
V-app bug (as in ,A-300), would the pilots have

2.3. REMRKS & ANSWERS:
(i) When two highly
experienced pilots have
permitted the speed to drop below the required
managed speed of 132 knots by an extent of
26 knots (i.e.) 106 knots without eithar of
them observing the loss of speed or commenting
about the loss of speed.
(ii)
Why was there no anxiety or panic till
7 to 8 seconds prior to the crash.
From the first day of canmencement of
flight training any
pupil pilot is made aware
of the great iiuoortance of speed to, achieve
flight of an aircraft and to
keep the aLrcraft
flying. Among the assessors there are two
pilots who have between them more than 63 years
of Airline flying experience
wherein, they have
operated as a crew with another pilot. In their
whole career none of them have ever obserVed a
pilot dropping his speed below Vapp without
immediate reaction to correct the dropping speed.
Capt.Gorden Corps in his affidavit has stated
that he has 30 years of experience as a test pilot.
He has been a CAA test pilot for concord° flight
certification. He has been a test pilot with
Airbus Industrie for the last 8 years and has
also been an instructor. During his deposition
Capt.Gorden Corps was asked the following question;
"From your own experience as well as
experience of other instructors of Airbus Industrie
or Aeroformation, have you ever come across or
479

heard of a pilot whose air speed monitoring
was such that he could not identify the danger
zone from the top of the VLb strip to the V
alpha max and permitted the speed to drop
from 5 knots above VL5 to V alpha max?"
The answer was "No, I have not found
anyone who had difficulty in identifying the
low speed scale".
Airbus Industrie and Aerodormation have
a large number of pilots with plenty of jet
transport background as well as transport aircraft
background requiring flights with other pilots as
part of the crew. The pilot assessors of the
court have enquired with other experienced pilots
if they have ever found any pilot who has dropped
the speed below Vapp by over 20 knots. The
answer has always been NO. The cumulative back—
ground experience of all these pilots would
extend to hundreds of years. If this enormous

The DFDR cannot give us any proof in this regard.
It is our opinion that this is a serious possibi—
lity that should be very carefully evaluated by

conducting
Indian Airlines A-320 simulator at Hyderabad.
480

The Indian Air Force was
requested to spare
the services of their Human Factor specialists
alongwith some of their newly acwuired equipment
for use during these tests and evaluations.
This had been agreed to and the Indian Airlines
had made arrangements
to provide the simulator
for Court's use. One of the exercises that had
been planned was a discrete change of airspeed
indications particularly the low speed display
of Magenta Vis, V alpha max
etc., by feeding in
a lower gross weight when
the pilot's attention
was drawn to another item in the cockpit. This
test could have given a clue as to whether the
absolute speed is monitored by A-320 pilots.
The court had requested the assistance of 20
line pilots from the ICPA but unfortunately the
ICPA for their own reasons did not wish to
co—operate with the court for conducting these
tests.
2.4. Taking into onsideration all factors as
above, a valid doubt arises as to whether some—
thing may have occured which could have given
wrong speed limit indication on the low speed
scale which generated a sense of security and
safety to the pilots whereby they did not
monitor the drop in speed of the absolute value
of CAS. If Vis is below current speed and the
speed trend indication is showing downwards with
Magenta speed selected, which moves under varying
conditions of flight with the Magenta being above
Vis, there is a possibility that both pilots were
481

comfortable with the speed of the aircraft.
That could be the reason why no speed calls
have been given by any of the pilots even
though the loss of 26 knots has been recorded
on the DFDR which occured over a period of
27 seconds from DFDR tine frame 296 to 323.
Airbus Industrie have issued an CEB No.
37/3 in April, 1989, on the subject of FMGC
malfunctions which has been admitted as exhibit
i34 wherein a possibility of loss of gross weight
memory has been indicated. This CAB has been
issued on the basis of reported FMGC resets/
malfunctions.

the data for display on the two PFD's. However,

serious consideration by the Human Factor Researchers
of all manufacturers who have the type of display
482

such as is available in the A310 and A-320.
There can be no doubt that the A-320 speed
display format is good. However, after this crash,
no area should be left unconsidered. It would be
prudent to carefully evaluate the possibility of
installation of a conventional ASI with a manual
speed bug setting which could also be used as a
standby airspeed indicator if necessary. A
provision could also be made for an audio warning
whenever the speed drops more than 5 knots below
the selected bug speed on the conventional ASI.
Such a feature may prevent a crash in
the future due to computations resulting from
incorrect gross weight at any time. Looking at
the DFDR data it is also observ0 that during
the last few seconds, an FGC bus and FMGC bus
have changed their modes which is also too much
of a coincidence to accept, though, Airbus
Industrie have taken great pains to explain that
from these change of status of the busses they
have deduced that FD 1 had been switched af.
In addition to FD1 being off, was this also
indicative of an internal failure in the FMGC,
cannot be answered as both the FMGC's have been
burnt after the crash and their memory data is
not available. It is also observed from the
FCOM that FMGC is not an item that is monitored
by the warning system either aural or visual of
the ECAM.(cid:9) 483

(iii) If conventional (earlier technology)
airspeed indicator had been provided with a
selectable Vapp bug (as in A300) would the
pilots have permitted the speed loss
without
observing the same?
The late
two pilots have obtained their
nearly 10000hours of experience
on previous
conventional aircrafts with conventional air—
speed
indicators. Each of them have flown
independently as captains. One of them has
even been an instructor, training pilots
wherein he would have been insisting on main—
tenance of correct speed. If any of the two
pilots had shown any tendency of dropping
speed below the minimum acceptable speed of
Vapp or"Vref, no instructor would have certified
them to even hold a co—pilot's rating on any of
the passenger transport aircraft let alone Pilot—
in—Command rating. This was also agreed to by
Capt.Gorden Corps during his deposition.
A commercial pilot on a public transport
aircraft is required to carryout a profeciency
check twice a year, an instrument rating check
once a year and route checks twice a year as
per the requirements of the regulatory authorities.
Added to the above he would have done extensive
simulator refreshers and detailed conversion
training on the simulators whenever he undergoes
conversion on to a different type of aircraft.
484

Flight training is also prescribed on some of
the aircraft. All these would be carried out
under the supervision of a. check pilot or an
instructor or an examiner. Both the pilots
Capt.Gopujkar and Capt.Fernandez had never
shown serious deficiency to any of their check
pilots or instructors throughout
their career,
the majority of which has been on conventional
aircrafts. If.a conventional airspeed indicator
was the one which had to be followed instead of
the present display of the A320, it is the opinion
of the two pilot assessors based on their own
experience as both as the line pilots and examiners
that this loss of airspeed would not -have occured.
(iv) If a stall warning like in a conventional
aircraft was available and had come on at
approximately 116 to 119 knots (as it had occured
on the A-320 aircraft MSNO01 FWWAI during a flight
carried out for the assessors by Airbus Industrie
at Toulouse on 20.6.1990), what, would have been
the reaction of the pilots and would this flight
have crashed?
On A-320, the pitch normal law which we
believe existed at the time of the crash on VT—EFN
there is no stall warning available. Stall warning
has been discussed at great length during the
deposition before the court. Capt.V.P.Thergoankar,
a very senior instructor examiner of Indian Airlines
who is also qualified on A-320 has clearly stated
during, his deposition: "Whenever there is a stall
warning the pilots instinctively go in for full power".
485

This court concurs with the opinion
expressed by Capt.Thergaonkar, as that is the
way a pilot is trained to react on any type
of aircraft whenever a stall warning occurs.
It has become necessary to discuss the
subject in greater detail due to the controversy
that has been generated with regcrd to absence
of stall warning in pitch normal law. Mr.Gerard
Guyot, (Director, Test and Development of Airbus
Industrie) is stated to be an expert technical
witness. He is also a pilot qualified on A-320.
During questioning (on page 33 of his deposition)
he indicated that stall warning would have come
at 105 knots on VT—EPN at the time of the crash
if this aircraft had been compared with a conven—
tional aircraft with a stall warning. (as per
certification requirements).
A few minutes later when asked as to the
speed at which audio stall warning would have come
Mr.Guyot answered:
"The audio stall warning would have come at 110
knots in the conditions of the Bangalore accident
(Page 34)".
Capt.Gorden Corps in his affidavit dated
25.7.1990 (Page 13) has stated that stall warning
would have occured at 105 knots if it were a con—
ventional aircraft and the previous evidence of
stall warning speed of 114 knots was incorrect.
486

The Court had requested Airbus Industrie
to carryout a flight on a A-320 aircfaft with
V-2500 engines certain profiles both under pitch
normal law and pitch direct law with the weight
close to the weight of VT-EPN at the time of the
crash. The flight was carried out on 20.6.1990
at Toulouse, France. One of the requested
profiles was to initiate TWA at the onset of
stall warning under pitch direct law and maintain
speed close to stall warning speed by having
intermittent audio stall warning. It was also
carried out close to 3000 ft. pressure altitude.
From the DFDR data supplied to the court it was
observed that stall warning had initially come
on at approximately 119 knots. As this was a
requested profile, it is accepted, that thrust
levers were moved to TOGA by Capt. Gorden Corps
who was the CommanC.2r of the flight when the
audio stall warning, was first generated which
as per the DFDR was at a CAC of 119 knots. One
of the assessors who was on board also confirmA
that during the exercise there was intermitant
audio stall warning. The lowest speed recorded
during this profile was close to.116 knots for a
period of 3 seconds. When we look at the DFDR
of VT-EPN a CA.. of 119 knots was passed at
data
313 DFDR time frame. If a stall warning as
observed on the Airbus Industrie aircraft during
the special flight was available on VT-EPN at_
119 knots, going by the instinctive reaction of
a pilot to apply TOGA at that DFDR time of 313
there is no doubt in our minds that
seconds,
487

this aircraft would have survived. Even if we
consider the lowest speed recorded during the
special flight test profile of 116 knots, VT—EPN
passed this speed between time frames 317 and 318.
Even if Doak had been applied at that time this
aircraft would not have crashed. The above
statements are based on even Airbus Industrie's
acceptance that VT—EPN needed a period of 4 seconds
of application of TOGA for its survival compared
to the actual alpha floor activation which occured
at 323.9.
The deposition of the experts from AJrbus
Industrie when compared with the actual occurance
of stall warning during the test profile carried
out by Airbus Industrie indicates a lack bf good
understanding of the actual design features. A
difference in speed between 105 knots and 119 knots
is quite considerable.
It would be prudent for all concerned to
seriously evaluate the requirement of stall
warning and audio stall warning to alert the crew
well in advance of impending disaster.

seconds earlier to the situation that was developing
and if so what would have been his reaction.
Would he have reacted on the thrust levers earlier?
One side stick movement during manual
488

flight does not have any reaction on the other
side stick. As per the VT-EPN DFDR, the CM-1
started pulling the side stick towards the
maximum from approximately time frame 319. If
it was a conventional control column, definitely
Capt.Gopujkar would have noticed this movement at
either time frame 320 or 321, because of peripheral
vision as well as the co-pilot's control column
physically moving backwards. If TOGA had been
applied at that time, would the aircraft have
survived would be matter of debate. Possibilities
of its survival cannot be ruled out. Definitely
the aircraft would have touched down within the
golf course itself, but, a little later than the
present touchdown point; if during the bounce,
after the first touchdown the aircraft had cleared
the embankment it would have survived. This court
does not wish to express anything further on this
subject except to indicate that further Human
Factor studies in-thi-s-maremay-be-advlsable for
consideration in the design of futur aircraft.

The assessors had planned to carryout a
test of the eye movements of the pilots during
their simulator test program indicated earlier
for determining the eye points of regard during
an approach on an A-320 aircraft by using eye
mark recorder cameras. This equipment was
available with the Indian Air Force Institute of
Aerospace Medicine Human Factor experts. This
court. could have obtained very valuable data
regarding the monitoring of the actual power
setting from the EPR guage during final approach
with auto thrust active. Unfortunately due to
non availability of volunteer pilots from the
IGPA who refused to co-operate, this court would
only indicate that a very serious Human Factor
study should be undertaken by specialists to
prevent any future accidents of this nature.
It would also be pertinent to note that
when a pilot is not at all used to operating
thrust levers during a normal flight, there could
be a slight delay in a pilot's reaction when
certain deviations are noted. This time delay
could be extremely serious in its consequence
under conditions that could lead to dangerous
situations as that which occured in the case of
VT-EPN.
(vii) What would be the effect of the type of
display that is available in A-320 in respect
speed
495

of the monitoring of the correct indicated airspeed
value by the pilots. Is the speed trend indication
and the type of warning indications in respect of
Vls V alpha prot an d V stall warning could generate
mistaken sense of security/safety:—
This is a matter which has been discussed
to a certain extent under item (i) and (ii).
However further elaboration may be appropriate.
One of the assessors has had considerable training
experience on A 310 aircraft when these were
introduced into his organisation. The other
assessor when he was given the opportunity to
fly thee-A 320, indicated that the speed trend
indication was so compelling that he was very
closely monitoring the trend indicator and trying
to achieve flight with no trend indication
without observing the absolute value of the
indicated airspeed. This had also been observed
by the assessor qualified on A 310 during his
training of pilots on that type of aircraft.
For this reason on the A 310, instructions had
been issued from the very beginning that during
approach the double bug had to be set it the
desired Vapp on the standby airspeed indicator
which was just next to the PFD on the left hand
side. It would not be very difficult to imagine
a pilot with a display as in the A 320 not to
get purturbed when the present speed of the aircraft
is above the amber region of the Viz, and above the
desired Magenta speed. Capt.Richard Pike in his
496

presentation has recommended the inclusion of
a digital box on the speed scale.indicating the
actual speed of the aircraft after a careful
discussion of the subject in his presentation.
Though this is a very good recommendation,
would this be enough to prevent a future accident
in case of incorrect indications as mentioned
earlier in items (i) and (ii). A standby ASI
in the correct position with a selectable speed
bug giving an audio warning when speed goes below
5 knots of the selected speed would ensure safety
at ail times.
(viii) What is the effect of Static auto thrust
system in the monitoring of the actual oower
existing during approach.
This item has already been discussed.
(ix) Would IDLE indicated in red or flashing red
at low altitudes during approach have made any
difference.
It is a general philosophy in every sphere
of activity or engineering to associate red colour
with danger and green with normal or satisfactory
operation. Even Airbus Industrie have clearly
defined their philosophy under the headings
"COLOUR CODE AND WARNING HIRARCHY" in FCOM 1.06.20
(Pages 1 and 2).
497

Under colour code, red warnings are used
forconfiguration or failure, needing immediate
action. Under warning hirarchy, red warnings are
indicated as level 3 which are for situations
needing immediate crew action, aircraft in
dangerous configuration or limit flight conditins
(example stall, overspeed), system failure altering
the flight safety (example engine fire etc.)
These warnings are associated to an
Aural warning : repitative chime sound or specific
sound.
Visual warning; Master warning red light flashing
until crew clearing action, warning
message on CRT (some exceptions).
On VT—EPN Capt.Gopujkar observed IDLE open
descent annunciated on the FMA a few seconds before
the crash. As per the CVR transcript of exhibit 1,
it is shown against crash second 24. The crash of
VT—EPN has fully demonstrated that IDLE open descent
on short finals and at low altitudes is a flight
situation which did cause the aircraft to get into
a dangerous configuration and limit flight condition
which needed immediate crew action. IDLE open
descent is indicated in green under all conditions
of flight. Capt.Gord_on Corps had accepted during
his deposition that red warning will attract
attention. However for the suggestion
immediate crew
that the colour of IDLE should be changed from green
to red after gear is selected down as a lesson from
498

this crah so that in future under such conditions,
during approach immediate warning is passed onto the
crew, his answer was evasive. This is a matter to
be seriously considered by the manufacturers,
operatars of Indian Airlines and our regulatory
autLorities. Preferably it should be associated with
an aural warning also, as explained under Warning
hirarchy.
(x) Coel:pit sliding windows:
These windows slide rearwards and can be
used for crew emergency exit. The court and the
assessors during their visit to the crash site
during February,1990, a few days after the crash,
had observed that a portion of the cockpit including
the RH cockpit sliding window appeared to be intact.
No wrinkles or deformation had been observed in the
framework of the fuselage surrounding the sliding
window. The front window was still in place. The
rear window aft of the sliding window was also in

thinking about the reasons why the pilots were not
able to use the emergency exit before they were
burnt to death. One of the witnesses Mr.Laxmaiah
Reddy had stated during the deposition that he had
seen someone hitting the cockpit window with his
fists before the fire engulfed the region. From
his position and explanation to the court it was
surmised that this might have been Capt.Gopujkar

111_ LH window could
not be opened by the use of
one hand either
left or right. However it could
be opened by using both
hands with the use of
the forward assist handle. As far as the RH window
was concerned, the window could not be opened by
using one hand or both hands also.
During the
period the assessor was in the aircraft, the
engineers could not also open the RH window
while sitting in the pilot's seat.
It is advisable that the design•of thiS
windoloi should be re-examined. The window should
be operable by the use of one hand at times of
emergency. In the A 320
it does appear that proper
leverage is not avAilable to open the window at
the position where the locking handle is situated
because of the angle at which this handle would
be, when the
seat is correctly positioned for
flight using the eye markers.
There is also the possibility that the
windows of VT-EPN may not have been opened from
the time it was inspected at Toulouse prior to
acceptance till the date of the crash due to
winter conditions prevailing in India and also
due to the air conditioning efficiency of the APU.
This a) uld have caused the beeding to stick to
the outer frame needing additional force to open
during emergency. Most probably all this would
have been overcome if the handle had been at the
front end of the window similar to A 300 or A 310
for reasons of affording better leverage.

On 29.8.1990, two of the assessors visited
rash site alongwith the secretary to the court.
Airlines provided an Assistant Engineering

formally. This indlcated that the RH
Ong window was in a fully operable
when the aircraft came to its final rest
and for some reason the pilot who was
A

,Le to open the window. The LI-I cockpit window
had been totally burnt though Capt.Fernandez in

could not be examined.
Did aesthetics detel-mine the location of
the sliding window handle? Did Airbus Industrie
consider hunan engineering aspects at the time of
this window design? Are there any lessons to be
learnt from this crash towards the design of
cockpit emergency window exits? These are all
matters for consideration by experts in the field
for use in future designs.
However it would be advisable for Indian
Airlines -to establish a procedure wherein these
502

windows are operated frequently during certair

It is also necessary to keep in mind th

2. SIMULATCR EXPFRIWNTS:
Airbus Industrie have in their technical
Note No.AI/E A 441.0377/90 dated 12-4-1990 have
confirmed that the angle of attacks corresponding
to Alpha Prot is 12d, Alpha Floor is 14.5",
Alpha Max is 15" and Alpha Cz Max is about 19".
They have indicated that weight and altitude have no
effect on these values. Alpha floor value is
subject to a correction term depending on
horizontal wind gradient.
FCCM 1.09.10, page 9 under heading
"PRCTECTIONS" in the Flight Controls chapter
have indicated high
angle of attack protection as
below:
"In pitch normal law, when angle of attack be—
comes greater than
alpha prot, the elevator
control is switched from normal mode to a pro-
tection mode where angle of attack is proportional
to side stick deflection. The
Alpha max cannot be
exceeded even if the
side stick is pulled fully
back. If the side stick is released the angle
of attack returns to
and maintains alpha prot.
This protection, which provides protection against
stall and windshear, has
priority over all other
protections.
Valpha prot varies between about 1.1.1 Vs(cont 0)
1.14 Vs (conf full)
and L Valpha floor
varies between about 1,08 Vs
(conf 0) and 1.11 Vs (conf full). Valpha max varies
between about 1.07 Vs (conf
0) and 1.06 Vs(conf
504

1.09.10 page 10 under note 1 states "At take off
alpha prot is equal to alpha max for 5 seconds."
By design, this aircraft is not sunnosed to
exceed the alpha max of 15w angle of attack at any
time even if the side stick is pulled fully back
under pitch normal law. But under pitch direct law
vide FCCm 1.09.10 page 15 there is a direct stick to
elevator relationship and no protections are
operating.
During the last few seconds of the flight,
when CM1 started pulling the side stick to the
fully back positicn from time frame 322, there w,)s
a right bank introduced. Left rudder was applied
during time frames 323 and 324 and again between
326 and 327 possibly to lift the wing. During
this bank the right hand side roll spoilers have also
been activated. The bank, roll spoiler activation
and rudder application und...-r the critical stage of the
flight with high angles of attack would have caused
(.=rtain loss in lift.
DFDR has also shown an increase in CAS from
106.5 kts at 323 to 113 kts at 329.(cid:9)
The aircraft
was not permitted to hold the speed of 106.5 kts
by the elevator computers even
though the side stick
w.s held fully back.
The court desired to analyse the performance on
,1-1 A 320 simulator when the bank angle and the rudder
application was removed, commencement of
engine
acceleration 1 second and 2 seconds earlier
compared to VT-EPN actual, permitting the aircraft
505

to go up to a maximum angle of attack of
17° and 18° angle of attack etc when compared
to a reference data programmed as close to
VT-EPN as possible.
CAE Electronics of Canada have built
a Phase III quality simulator for
Indian
Airlines using aircraft data and parts
supplied by Aerospatiale of France who
is a partner of Airbus Industrie. Indian
Airlines had specified that the data
supplied should be based on the performance
of the Indian Airlines aircraft with tail
No.045. That aircraft is now• flying with
Indian Airlines. The data and aircraft parts
supplied by Aerospatiale is expected
to
correspond
to the performance of the Indian
Airlines aircr9ft with V 2500 engines
derived
from the performance of aircraft with tail
No.045.
The Court commissioned CAE Electonics to pro,
-4
gramme certain data into the simulator. The
results of the various tests in the form
of plots of simulator respmewere to be
taken and submitted to the court.
The following tests were performed:
TEST No.1 :(cid:9)
The first test attempts to match the
flight data as close as possible. This is accom-
plished by allowing
certain control surfaces
to diverge in order to maintain specific outputs.
This is necessary in order to limit error
506

accumulation due to factors mentioned above.
TEST No.2(cid:9) :(cid:9) This test is identical to test No.1
except that all roll and yaw movements have boen
moved. Aileron, spoilers and rudder inputs
are zero for this test.
TEST No.3(cid:9) These tests are the same as
test No.1 except that the final thrust initi-
ation is:
a) 1 second earlier
b) 2 seconds earlier
TEST No.4(cid:9) :(cid:9) These tests are the sage as tests 3a)
and 3b) except that all roll and yaw movements
have been removed.
TEST No.5 • Omitted.
•
TEST No.6(cid:9) These tests were done in direct law
by pulling the CB's of the two radio altimeters.
This allows the simulator to go beyond- the
angle of attack protection.
TEST No.6a :(cid:9) Same as test No.1 exceot that the si-
mulator was allowed to attain an angle of attack
of 18 degrees in the final portion of the
approach.
TEST No.6b(cid:9) Same as6a)except that thrust
initiation is 1 second earlier.
TEST No.6c(cid:9) Same as6a) except that thrust
initiation is 2 seconds earlier.
TEST No.7(cid:9) These tests are the same as 6 exceot
that a maximum angle of attack of 17 degrees was
allowed.
507

The following parameters are displayed
in the various pages as below and can be
compared with the crash flight data where
avail-
able. Test No.1 has been
simulated in the
following manner:
PAGE No.1 : Calibrated airspeed is an output that
was matched with the
crash flight data except
for the effect of wind gusts.
PAGE No.2 : Magnetic heading is an output that
was initialized at the start of the test.
PAGE No.3 8. 4 : eFn of engines 1 and 2 are
displayed with an inherent time lag due to the
simulator
system. Therefore,
they do not re-
present the true state of the engines at
any
one time. However, net thrust developed
which is correct is, displayed
on page 15.
PAGE No.5(cid:9)
: Roll angle is en output that is mat-
ched with the crash flight data by introducing
necessary
deviations in the aileron inputs.
PAGE No.6(cid:9) : Pitch angle is an output that is mat-
ched
with crash flight data by introducing
necessary deviations in the elevator inputs.
PAGE No.7(cid:9) : Radio altitude is an output that
was initialized at the start of the
test from
the point of ground contact.
PAGE No.8(cid:9)
: Elevator position is an input
(see note for page 6 ).
PAGE No.9 TOP: Stabilizer position is an exact
input.
PAGE No.9 BOTTOM: Aileron position is an input
(see note for page 5).
508

PAGE No.10(cid:9) : Rudder angle is an exact
input.
PAGE No.11(cid:9) : Average left and right spoilers
are exact inputs. Slight deviations from the
crash flight data are due to averaging
of spoiler surfaces.
PAGE No.12(cid:9) : Aerodynamic angle of attach is an
output.
PAGE No.13(cid:9) : Pressure altitude is an
output.
(cid:9)
PAGE No.14 Longitudinal and normal acceler—
ations are outputs.
PAGE No.15(cid:9) Net thrust is displayed in order to
reflect the true state of the
engine.
PAGE No.16(cid:9) : Altitude rate is an output.
Test Numbers 2 to 7 are results of certain
modifcations intruduced to test No.1 Specific
variations of the inputs with respect to test
No.! are explained against each test.
The data that was obtained have Chown certain
trends.
The court was aware that extct simulation
was not possible due to non availability of
complete environmental data and also due to
slight difference in the simulator data And
the actual VT—EPN performance. However certain
vital parameters were closely matched to the besi
possible extent in test No.1 to form a base for
comparison purpose keeping in view some of the
509

design characteristics as given in FCCM. Radio
altitude and pressure altitude were matched
at ground level to obtain a reference of the
first touch down at about 329.8 seconds. The
time base has been from DFDR times 295 to 331.5 seconds,
as the DFDR had stopped recording at approximately 331.4
seconds. A generic visual data base was used
with R/W direction as 09.
The details of inputs and outputs for test No.1
have been explained earlier. Certain modifications
to the test No.1 were introduced in the subse-
quent tests for evaluating the reactions of the
simulator.
The results of these tests are limited
by the accuracy of the various system models
and the sample rate of the input data (most
flight data has a sample rate of once per
second). One copy of the plots obtained during
these tests was submitted to the court by CAE
Electronics Limited which was marked as
Exhibit 118. On the plots the dot4eH lines are
DFDA data and full lines are simulator plots.
Weight of aircraft, centre of gravity (CG)TAT
(Total Air Temperature)were closely matched.
Altitude of the first touch down was consi-
dered as the reference altitude and for survival
of the aircraft it was assumed that the aircraft
should be at least 30 ft. above this reference
altitude at time 331.4 seconds to clear the
embankment and the small trees on top of the
510

embankment. The following were observed during
the play back of thu profiles and the generated
plots:
Test I • Aircraft crashed short of R/W. Maxi-
mum angle of attack reached is
approximately a little over 13°.
Test 2 : Aircraft crashed a little beyond the
reference point of test No.1 as it
could not clear the embankment.
Test 3(a): Aircraft crashed shortly after time
330 though net thrust reacher
approximately 56000 Newtons at 331.4
seconds.
Test 3(b): Aircraft crashed into embankment
though net thrust reached a
little over 80000 Newtons at
331.4 seconds. CAS showed improve-
ment just before 331.4 seconds or
assumed embankment position.
Test 4(a): Not being able to clear the embank-
ment, the aircraft crashed.
Test 4(b): Again not being able to clear the
embankment the aircraft crashed.
CAS showed improvement just before embankment.
Test 5 :(cid:9) Omitted.
Test 6(a), 6(b) and 6(c) are under direct law per-
mitting the aLrcraft to go upto 18° angle of attack.
Tests 7(a), 7(b) and 7(c) are under direct low
permitting the aircraft to go up to 17° angle
of attack.
Test (cid:9) CAS went below base line of 105 knots but
aircraft did not stall and crash. Maximum pitch
511

was
angle reached 1 17,5°(cid:9) Minimum radio
altitude reacneo was approximately 40 feet at 329
seconds (above reference touchdown point
of Test 1). Aircraft survived clearing
embankment.
Test 6(11:(cid:9) CAS went below 105 knots but
aircraft did not stal). Minimum radio
altitude reached was 65 ft. at 328 seconds
(above reference touch down point of Test 1).
Pressure altitude also reflects in•similar
fashion.
Altitude rate became positive from 328.4
seconds.
Test 6(c):(cid:9)
CAS went below 105 knots but
aircraft did not siall. Lowest radio altidue
was again 65 ft. at 328 seconds (above reference
touch down point of Test 1). Pressure altitude
also reflects in similar fashion. Altitude rate
become positive from 328 seconds.
Test 7(a):(cid:9) CAS went below 105 knots but
aircraft did not stall and crash.
Maximum pitch angle reached 16°.
Lowest radio altitude was 35 ft. at 329.5 seconds.
Aircraft survived clearing embankment.
Test 7(b):(cid:9) CAS went below 105- knots but
aircraft did not stall.
Lowest radio altitude was 55 ft. at 328.7
seconds. Pressure altitude is also reflected in
a similar manner. Rate of climb became positive
at 329 seconds and was approximately 450 ft.
per minute at 331 seconds.
512

Test 7(c):(cid:9)
Minimum CAS reached is 10
5.75
knots at 330.2 seconds. Aircraft did not stall
and crash. Lowest
radio altitude recorded is
60 ft. at 328 seconds.
Pressure altitude is also reflected
in a in a similar manner.
Rate of climb became positive at
328.4 seconds and exceeded 500 ft. per minute
at
329.8 seconds.
The results indicate:—
At 58 tonnes Vs lg was 104 knots as
confirmed by A.I. Based on CAA requirements Vs
minimum would work out to 98 knots (0.94 Vsjg)
and a
as per FAA regulations' it would workout to 95 knots
(0.91 Vsig) if this was a conventional aircraft.
Airbus Industrie
have manufactured other
aircraft such as A 300, A 310, A300-600 1 which
have conventional primary flight controls
and are
presently operating all over the world using Vs
minimum and other speeds computed with
ri.qpect to
Vs minimum. Vs ig is a
new terminology which
has come recently, and merely changing
the ter—
minology would not
alter the characteristics of the
plane.
Compared to Test 1 which was
under pitch normal law, when direct
law was used
for Tests 6a, 6b and 6 c with
maximum angle of
attack up to 18° and Tests 7a, 7b
and 7c with
maximum angle of
attac1( up to 17° the altitude
df the aircraft from the simulator plots was
513

above 30 ft. at time frame 331.4 Seconds.
From comparisionof radio altitude plots of
Tests 1 8. 2, it is observed that the simulator
was at approximately 15 ft. above reference alti-
tude at 329.8 seconds. This test No.2 was identi-
cal to Test No.1 except for the removal of all
roll and yaw movements. The plane was assumed
to have flown with wings level.
Airbus Industrie has indicated in its
letter AI/E FS 420.0145/90, dated 26.6.1990 that
the total loss of altitude due to the roll and
yaw inputs of VT-EPN from time 308 to the time
of impact was 7 ft. This figure from A.l wa s
based on some simulations it had carried out.
Though the court had requested Airbus Industrie to
get another opinion from the wing manufacturers
of the A 320, court has not received any such
information.
Test 6a was the same as Test No.1 but
the simulator was nermitted to go to 18° in the
final portion of the approach under direct law.
The maximum pitch angle reached was 17.5°. The
minimum radio altitude reached was 40 ft. at 329
seconds and the aircraft was 50 ft above reference
altitude at 331 seconds showing a climb gradient.
The speed did go below the base line of 105 knots
which had been selected for the plot but the the
simulator did not stall. Aircraft survived
514

clearing embankment. Test 7a was similar to Test 6a
but the aircraft waspermitted to go to 17° angle of
attack under pitch direct law. Themaximum pitch
angle reached was 160, lowest altitude was 35 ft.
above reference altitude at 329.5 seconds. Aircraft
was showing a climb at 331 seconds and was at 40 ft.
above reference altitude. The aircraft did not
stall and survived clearing the embankment. The
CAS went below the base line of 105 knots.
The performance of the aircraft under direct
law with commencement of engine acceleration 1 second
and 2 seconds earlier for conditions of Tests 6a
and 7a showed marked improvement. At 331 seconds the
heights above reference datum were higher and in
Test 7c the minimum CAS also remained above 105 knots.
In the nresent VT—EPW accident the aircraft
dropped the right wing when CM1 pulled the side
stick fully back. The court wanted to check about
this coincidental occurance during the test flight
planned with Indian Airlines aircraft at 3000 ft.
pressure altitude over the sea—to_simulnteapnroach
of VT—EPN at Bangalore with line pilot volunteers
operating controls under the supervision of an
examiner.
Unfortunately ICPA declined to give volunteer
pilots. Even a flight with examiners only, was not
agreed to by the DGCA to carry out-the profiles at
3000 ft. pressure altitude over the sea, though tiro
of the examiners namely-Capt.S.T.Deo, Director of
515

Training and Capt.V.P,Thergaonkar,
Operations
Manager,
Training of Indian Airlines Who met the
assessors on their arrival at Hyderabad on 17.7.1990
were inclined to carry out the profiles as line
pilots were not going to be on board.
It would be a useful exercise for A.I as
the manufacturer to carry out further research using
ordinary line pilots to see if a CM1 pulling the
side stick fully back whilst looking outside would
generate a roll to the right. There is a possibility
of
the CM2 generating a roll to the left.
Though the aircraft has been certified by
v rious authorities, again it would advantageous
for the certifying authorities including the DGCA,
India, Airbus Industrie as the manufacturers and
Indian Airlines asbig operator of aircrafts, to
carry out further research regarding the possibility
of increasing alpha max under pitch normal law which
may possibly improve the performapce, should a
situation
similar to that of VT—EPN should ever
cccuragain, even if it was due to severe wind shear
close to the ground.
Both I.A and INC, the engine manufacturers have
already started the -rocess towards increasing the
approach idle RPM by 2.5%. This would definitely
improve the engine acceleration time. Tests 6b and
6c, 7b and 7c when compared to 6a and 7a have shown
that an earlier
acceleration by 1 second and 2 seconds
516

considerably improves the performance. Similarly
test 3a and 3b compared to Test 1 showed an
improvement; certainly this is an improvement
towards flight safety.
517

APPENDIX — III
FLIGHT TEST BY AIR BUS INDUSTrIE:
It was felt that there was a pw-sibility of a
slight delay in acceleration of the engines at high
angles of attack due to the change in the air flow
pattern into the engines. Another poc..sibility was
uneven acceleration of the two engines because of
an abrupt ruder input in the last few seconds
which could cause channe of air flow into the ermine'.
The acceleration 'ata in respect of the V 2500
engines provided to the court indicated the acceleration
characteristics at 0 pressure altitude of 5000 ft.
an under ISA conditions, the a:-celer-)tion commencing
at 0.25 Vlach from approach idle to take off thrust.
The FAA requirements specify that the engines
should accelerate from approach idle to a thrust
level required by the aircraft to achieve a climb
gradient of 3.2% in landing configuration with both
engines operating within a period of 8 seconds.
Though alpha max by design Yas 15
°, on VT—EPN,
we had observed an angle of attick reaching the
value of 16.759 at DF[R time frame 328.641 seconds.
The court desired that a flight test be ma:".e to see
if such angles of attack was achieved by other
aircraft and also to estlblish if this high angle of
attack experienced by VT—EPN was due to any other
reason. The court had desired to carry out this
manoeuvre simulatirw Bangalore conditions at a
pressure altitude of 3000 ft. over the sea under
pitch norm41 law with an Indian Airlines aircraft also
518

with Indi,,0 Airlines both ith ex miners
operating
the controls and y,ith lir,c pilots operating the
controls under suoervis.io n of exdminers to establish
in addition to the above, the altitude loss Airing
during such manoeuvres For comparing such loss with
the VT—EPN altitude loss. Unfortun!tely, as explained
earlier, the flight test was not permitted by the DGCA,
India. The flioht test would have given valuable
information to the court.
AIRBUi Industrie promptly carried out the tests
desired by the court both uner. flitch ,orn11 low and
pitch direct law. Capt. G.Corps was in command with
Mr.Guyot as first officer. One of the Assessors,
Capt.C.R.S.Rao was on board Is an observer. Total
flight time was 0145 hrs. Weight - t take off was
59 tonnes, with centre of gravity ot 28%. The aircraft
registration was FINAI and it via,- fitted with V 2500
engines similar to that of Indian Airlines. All
relevant computers were at the standard of the
Indian Airlines aircraft. Date of the flight was
20.6.1990. The meteorological conditions were clear
and calm with QNH of 1017 HP which was the same as at
Bangalore at the time of the crash of VT—EPN. Airbus
Industrie made an attempt to be as close as possible
to the Bangalore VT—EPN profile.
The profiles carried out were:
1. A repeat of the Banoalore accident scenario.
2. A. recovery in direct law at statl warning.
3. A recovery at stall speed pluS 12 kts.
4. A demonstration of engine acceleration at maximum
angle of attack.
519

From the detiiled UDR data made available to
the court the following were evident;
1) A repeat of the Bangalore accident scenario;
The DFER data from 15.8.0n
UTC to 15.11.59 UTC
has been provided to cover this profile. In these
four minutes recording, the complete DFfR data from
15.10.36 to 15.10.43 could not be retrieved fox reasons
which have not been explained by airbus Industrie.
Prior to the alpha floor activ-Ition the approach
idle of engine No.1 was 65.25% IP and of engine No.2
was 65.50% N2. Activation of alpha floor was at 15.10
14.5 UTC based on EPR command a,,suA.ng verrion 1
(as Airbus Industrie have not indicated the version).
EFR co.omand engine I would be in
word 34. Though EAR
command initi;lly wAs 1.422 on both engines it reduced
to 1.418 a few reconds later for reasons unknown and
came back to 1.422 and later to 1.430. EPR command on
both engines remained at 1.418 againrt time 15.10.24
but EPR actual engine 1 at the same time was 1.425 and
for engine 2 was 1.420. This was the maximum power
reached during acceleration. However after another 20
seconds EPR went up to 1.432 because of the increased
EPR command. From the point of view of engine
acceleration if we consider that the 1.425 EPR of
engine 1 and 1.420 E1{ of engine 2 as the equivalent of
TOGA during this engine acceleration, it was achieved
against time frame 15.10.24. There was a slight
difference in the EPR's of the two enoines at every
stage of the acceler tion with onqiie 1 EIR leading the
engine 2 EPR. Both engines acclerated from approach
idle to TOG'A in almost the same time (ie) in 9.5 seconds .
520

•SPPC was —13.27 at 15.10.12.5 reCS and —14,94
at 15 10 13.5. Interpolating, !7SrPC would have gone
through 14° at 15 10 12.9 secs, which ,:ould be the time
alpha floor was trigoered. From the above it cin be
seen that the time lapse betwr'en ,0.011-1 floor trieoering
and alpha floor activation is 1.6 secs. If it is
considered that alpha floor activation has occured
fractionally before 15 10 14.5 secs, then the acceleration
time would increase beyond 9.5 secs by th)t fraction.
But, for comparison purposes vdth further tests, the
EPR command his been taken as alpha floor activation.
During this profile the pressure altitude loss •was
124 ft. (2827-2703), minimum speed re-ached wls 110.25
at time 15.10.17. The maximum anole of -attack prior to
commencement of acceleration was 13.53° actull aeainst
time 15.10.13 which increased to 14.94° during engine
acceleration when EFR had reached approximately 1.12
(slightly higher EPR than VT—EP! at the time of touch—
down). The angle of attack recorded ,1 maximum of
16.16° at 15.10.24 when both engines were It take off
thrust.
klpha prot of 12° was passed at 15.10.08. The
stabilizer position recorded ,t that time was —6.32.
Though the stabilizer position recorded was after the
angle of attack recording of 12° actual angle of attack,
the stabilizer position continued to increase to
—6.58 at 15.10.10. 5FITPC w), hold fully back and the
stabilizer position changed to —6.59 at 15 10 22 and
—6.23 at 15 10 23- and continued to change further to
—5.18 at 15 10 2b. The Y-TFC has been moved forward
betlen the times 15 10 26 and 15 10 27. The actual

court by Airbus Industrie reidained above 120
throughout this period. the initi:11 change of
stabilizer position towards further nose up trim in
alpha protection zone cannot be explained as it is
contrary to what is described in the FCOM.
The pitch angle which was £;.14° at 15 10 10
went on reducing to the lowest fioure of 7.567
at
times 15 10 16, 15 10 17 and 15 1 ' 10 bofore it
started increasing and the engine power built up.
During tAs period the sidesti.ck was pulled Lock and
held fully back.
Within a short period after the court's
requirement of the Bangalore scenario k.as completed
and the aircraft continued to climb away, it was
noticed that a large number of errors occured in the
Of' R data recordings. Of particular interest would be
12 incorrect xeodinns of normal !cceler Ition, 6 of
lateral acceleration and 9 of longitudinal acceleration.
Within a time period of 4 minutes there were 82 incorrect
recordings plus complete A -ecands uTIR rlio was
missing.
There are some very significnt differences seen
in the perform'nce of this aircr3ft when compared to
the performance of VT—EPH v:hich would be Hiscw,.snd
later after observations recvarr1Lig all trafiles are
completed.
2) Recovery in direct law at stallwarning:.
The assessors had requerted for a profile under
522

direct law to be flown at a speed when stql warning
occurs and wintain such speed to get intermittent
stall warning and the thrust levers were to be moved
from idle to TOG\(cid:9) the first stall warning. Again
aircraft would be in landing configuration. The stall
warning occurred .)t 120 knots and TOGA command was
given at 15.16.46. Approach idle on both engines was
65,25% N2. The initial EPR commond was 1.422 which
again reduced to 1.419 during engine acceleration.
The left enoine reached 1.419 SFR(cid:9) 15.16.55. The
right enaine reached 1.421 LIB at 15.16.54. Both
engines reached 1.422 EHR at 15.16.56, which was the
maximum. During this engine acceleration the right
engine EFR was leaning the left engine EFR which was
poposite to the previous profile.secondly the time
taken to reach the maximum thru-,t was(cid:9) c'econds which
was again more than the previous case. The a.;gles
of attack (actual) durino this profile were 15.05°
at 15.16.46, 14.84° at 15.16.42, 15.25° at 15.16.51
and 16.86° at 15.16.52 which came dawn to 14.34° at
15.16.54. During this m3neouver the pressure altitude
loss was only 55 ft. (7966-2911). As per Airbus
Industrie report, stall warning occurred at 120 knots.
TOGA was applied at 119 knots and minimum speed during
manoeuver was 116 knots at 15.16.50. The duration of
the DFDR recording supplied to the court was for
2 minutes from 15.16.00 to 15.17.59 to cover this
profile. There were three erroneous recordings in the
data in this 2- minutes period of. which 2 v%ere longi—
tudinal acceleration plrameteis.
523

3) Recovery at stall speed plus 12 knots
The assessors had requested for this profile to
be carried out at 12 knots above the actual aerodynamic
stall speed of the aircraft under direct law to simulate
a performance of an aircraft with conventional controls
close to stall warning. We had anticipated that at
58 tonnes the aerodynamic stall would be close to
98 knots (Vmin as per CAA regulations). However it
does appear that Airbus Inc'ustrie 11-'0 misunderstood our
request. The assessors had not indicated any specific
speed because of not being able to know the weight of
the aircraft when this profile was performed. The
excercise was carried out maintaining a higher speed.
Still, this profile also gives a good amount of
information for analysis.
The TOG\ command through thrust levers was given
at 15.23.34 UTC. Approach idle of both engines prior
to acceleration was 65.25% M. The EPR command was
1.422 which again later reduced to 1.418. Ho,Aever
during acceleration maximum EPR actual reached by engine
no.1 was 1.421 at 15.23.45. Similarly EFR actual of
engine 2 reached the maximum of 1.421 at 15.23.46.
During this acceleration the No.2 engine was leading
the No.1 engine till 15.23.44 but lagned behind in the
last two seconds to reach 1.421.
The pressure altitude loss from TOGS command to
recovery was 121 ft. (2965-2944). CAS maintained was
from 119 to 121 knots. Maximum actual angle-of attack
reached prior to TOG'S command was 9.690 at 15.23.32.
524

It increased to 11.51° at 15.23.36. After a slight
reduction during the next few seconds, it increased to 14.84°
at 15.23.42 and 16.05° at 15.23.43.
The DFOR data covering the profile was for a
period of 4 minutes from 15.22.00 UTC to 15.25.59 UTC.
The period covered the fourth profile of engine
acceleration at high angles of tack also. There were
many incorrect recordings on the nron, and this would be
discussed after profile 4.
4) Demonstration of engine acceleration at maximum angle
of attack:
During this exercise, stabilized a.)proach idle was
65.25% on both engines. TDC3 command by thrust levers
was at 15.24.42. Pressure altitu.:'e lots was 56 ft'.
(2875-2819). The C-kS during, altitu- e loss was 118 and
117 knots. During acceleration the EPR command was
1.418. However a mJximum Ell of 1.428 was reached by
engine 1 at 15.24.52. An EPR of 1.423 was reached by
engine 2 at 15.24 52. Both engines during this profile
accelerated to maximum thrust in 10 seconds. During
the acceleration the left engine started leading the
right engine after the lapse of 6 seconds. The angle of
attack at TOGA initiatiop was 10.90° at 15.24.42.
Earlier it was slightly less. The angle of attack
started increasing from 15.24.45 to a value of 17.78°
at 15.24.49. Me angle of attack started decreasing from
then on.
In the 4 minutes of the DFDR .Tiata which covered
profiles no.3 and 4, there were a total of 66 erroneous
recordings. Of these 14 were normal acceleration values,
6 were longitudinal acceleration values and 5 were lateral
acceleration values.(cid:9)
525

Though the flight v,as for a total duration of
0145 hours, we h.'ve considered only 10 minutes data of
which 8 secondswexe missing. In this data we have
observed 151 erroneous recordings, themaximum number
being a total of 2b in the norm)l aceleration parameter
followed by 17 in the longitudinal acceleration parameter,
12 in the pressure altitude parameter and 11 in the lateral
acceleration parameter.
Surprisingly, majority of such erroneous recordings
(cid:9)
occurred within a short period after flight 3t hioh
angle of attack is carried out. The acceleration
parameters themselves accounted for 54 of these erroneous
recordings which is 36% of the total number. The
incorrect acceleration recordings ranged from —7.37488
to +5.89178. The aircraft was in flight and there was
no way that these values could be achieved either by
design or by severe violent manual handlino. Some of
the recordings were isolated and some were grouped in
2,3,4 and even 5 consecutive recordings. At some places,
in consecutive recordings, the incorrect figures were close
to each other while in other places the figures were
very much different.
Airbus Industrie had furnithed certain limited
Parameter data to check on increase in N2 rpm on slat
extension. This data was from 14.45.00 to 14.43.59
It was observed that 12 rpm of engine 1 increased from
rpm of
64.75% to 69.25%, an increase of 4.5%. The N2
engine 2 increased from 65.25% to 69.50% which was an
increase of 4.25%. The pressure altitude during this
test v.35 aPProximately 9000 ft. Nirbus Industrie have
526

tried to be close to the speed of VT—EPN. There were
no erroneous recordings in this limited part of the
MDR data. On VT—EPN the increase recorded was less
than these figures. The no.1 increased by 2.75% from
66 to 68.75. No.2 increased by 3% from 65.75 to 68.75.
Exhibits 102 and 103 which were taken on other
aircraft
has shown increases from 6% to 8%. For some, reason,
VT—EPN showed a lower increase.
Significant comments about erroneous recordings would be:
a)
There was not a single erroneous recording from 15.08.00
to 15.10.14 at which time the first profile recovery
commenced. Theinitial erroneous recordings were in the
acceleration parameters from 15.10.21 which was
followed later by other i5arameters. There were no
erroneous recordings from 15.11.20 till 15.11.59. The
aircraft was again at low angles of attack during this
period.
b) Similarly there were no errors recorded from 15.22.00
till 15.23.34 while carrying out profiles 3 and 4. The
recovery had been commenced at 15.23.34.
c) In data of profile 2 there were no errors from
15.16.00 to 15.16.46 when recovery was comilenced.
d) There is a definite po!•sibil-ity that accelerometers
are prone towards erroneous values after a flight at
high angles of attack. Airbus Industrie should
carefully investigate the quality of the accelerometers
fitted on the A 320 which feeds the data to the DIM
for acceleration recordings for their behaviour
during and shortly after recovery from a flight at
high angles of attack. As many other parameters have
527

also been recorded erroneourly. Airbus Industrie
may have to investigate the DFCR as well as the
intervening computers which collect the date, for
their performance, after a flight at high angles
of attack.
VT—EPN had gone through a phase of a flight
at high angles of attack prior to the high normal
acceleration recordings against time frames 329 and
330. Therefore a doubt may lri'e about the
correctness of the DFCR recordinos under such
circumstances, in the light of the physical evidence
and survivor statement.
The above 4 profiles hive also indicated that
the same two engines, when different profiles were
carried out, did not accelerate at the same time
from approach idle to TOGA (maximum go around
thrust reached during accl,:rition). Even the same
characteristics of acceleration were not maintained.
More data could have been sppplied if a flight as
planned with another aircraft belonging to
Indian Airlines, hid been carried out.
During June 1990, the assessors had visited
the Engine Manufacturers Establishment at Hartford
in USA. The International Aero Engines use a
private 'Andrew Viillgoore facility' for testing
their engines at high altitude, bird ingestion tests,
etc. They also use the Pratt and Whitney facility
nearby for assembly of the engines and final.
528

delivery tests prior to shipping the engines to the
4ircraft manufacturers or the customers.
They had no facility to carry out acceleration
tests at different angles of lttack let alone at
high angles of attack. The only way theFe character—
istics could be established as by carrying out actual
flight tests and that is the reason why the court
had requested Airbus Industrie and Indian Airlines
to carry aut certain profiles.
The present certification requirements as per
FP as described under 33.73 power or thrust response,
is the requirement for acceleration demonstration by
the engine manufacturers, and under 25.119 landing
climb: all engines operating is for emonstration in
flight by the aircraft manufacturer. The salient
features of these are:
a) Engine should accelerate from the fixed minimum
flight idle power lever position when provided, or
if not provided,ftm not more than 15% of rated
take off power to 95% of rated take off power in
not more than 5 seconds. The thrust lever should be
moved from minimum to maximum position in less than
1 sec. Only bleed air and accessories loads
necessary to run the engines shoJld be used. This
is to be demonstrated by the engine manufacturer.
b) During flight in the landing configuration the
steady gradient of climb T--ly not be lees than 3.2%
with;
529

i) the engines at the power or thrust that is
available 8 secs after initiation of movement
of the power or thrust controls from the minimum
flight idle to the take off position; and
ii) a climb speed of not more than 1.3 Vs.
In respect of A 320 instead of 1.3 Vs it would be
1.23 Vslg.
This acceleration ispredic'ted on a speed of
Vref being maintained at the time of conmencement of
acceleration. Normally the aircraft, would be at
low angles of attock during approlch v,hen Vref is
maintained. There are no requirements for emon—
stration of acceleration it high angles of attack.
A representative of Inderntional Aero Engines,
Mr.Craig R.Bolt, during his cross examination, stated
that the current requirements under FAA regulations
have been in force since the lite 1960's but he was
unable to confirm the exact date on which these
regulations came into being.
Possibly these regulations were first brought
in at the time of the first jet transport aircraft.
During the 1960's the early turbo fan engines had
a fairly low by pass ratio. Me by pass ratio of
the V 2500 engine is vproxim)tely 5.42 according
to V 2500/A' 320 operations review of IAE(Exhibit 44).
Mr, Craig R.Dolt stated th't there are other
engine models that h ave by pass ratios slightly
6.
over
530

Engine design and perforrlance have made
tremendous progress during the last 30 years. The
acceleration characteristics of the earlier engines
are different from those of the present day' engines.
For example in the V 2500 there is hardly any net
thrust increase during the first 5 to 6 secs. In
the last two secs. the thruct increase is very rapid
The only acceleration data recorded during
flight made available to the court was at 5000 ft. in
level flight with accelerati-m co,.nencine from approach
idle to TOGA at a speed of 0.25(cid:9) andISA. No
acceldration data recorded under different
conditiors were made available by Airbus Industrie
until these profiles were carried out.
The certification authorities may carefully
evaluate if the regulations which ire in existence
for the last 30 years or more should be reviewed
for change if necessary to cater to the modern high
by pass ratio engine like the V 25C0. It is also
necessary for the air crew to be advised that engine
acceleration may not be achieved vgithin 8 secs.

Another sidnificant ob-elv-Itian is the

the possibility of rough air when VT_EPI.J passed
over uneven ground and trees durina the last few
seconds. in mid Afternoon vdth a certain amount
of wind existing. The maximum angle of attack
reached by VT-EPN was 16.8° while, during the flight
test repeat of the Bangalore scenario, it was 16.160.
In VT-EPN the speed was 11)6.5 kis. at 323
which increased to 113 kts at 329. Under pitch
normal law, the computers did not permit the
aircraft to convert this kinetic energy to reduce
533

the height loss. The tailwind which was existing
had shown a decrease during the last few seconds
of VT—EPH. As per the photograph when the aircraft
was burning published by some magazines, there was
a head wind component as shown by the way the
smoke was drifting. A. tail wind to held wind
change improves the performance of the aircraft.
Possibly, this it the reison v;hy the C'r., increased
and the aircraft touched down lightly during the fir-1
touchdown. But (7till, the height loss of VT—EP

probably, this is due to the po,sihility of rough ail..
However, two of the profiles of the flight.tests
have established that under direct law, going to
slightly higher angles of attack, height loss is
reduced. It would be for the certification
authorities, Airbus Indus: trio, 'GC.t India and
Indian Airlines (as a major operator who has lost
an aircraft) to examine the matter very carefully
and to see if V alpha max could be increased
slightly to improve performance and thereby future
flight safety.
Stall warning may be introduced under pitch
normal Dv, at a weight/speed correlltion similar to
that .4hich occurred on the Airbus Indus- trie aircraft
during the flight test.

On 26th October 1PPO the court received
certain documentation. In that we find a letter
dated 14.11.1988 from Capt. A.Marneros, Chief
Pilot of Cyprus Airways Limited to the Civil
Aviation Authority, UK, requesting for a temporary
approval for the use of Aeroformation A-320 simu-
lator at Toulouse for training of the first crew
comprising of the Fleet Manager and ;Technical
'Pilot of their A-320 fleet. This had become ne-
cessary until that simulator was fitted with
V-2500 engine programme.
CAA replied on 30.11.88 according approval
for these two pilots to do their training on the
Aeroformation simulator at Toulouse and then
appear for the 1179 flight test on a "one off"
basis. This is not an approval issued by CAA
generally approvihg an A-320 simulator fitted with
CFM 56 engines for training pilots onto A-320
aircraft fitted with V-2500 engines. Most pro-
bably it appears that these pilots of Cyprus Airways
hold UK licences or their checks are conducted by
UK, CAA and hence specific request for an exemption
for two pilots was made, which normally any autho-
rity may grant with or without stipulations, eva-
luating the specific e:dsting conditions.
In the same documentation we find an English
translation of a letter from Yugoslav FAA. It is
538

a general approval of the Aeroformation transi-
tion training programme for A-320
flight crews.
This approval was granted on 16-9,.1989. This
approval does not specify anything about an
A-320 simulator fitted with Cfl4 56 engines having
been approved for training
flight crews for A-320
aircraft with V 2500 engines.
The documentation also contains
a report of
Recurrent Inspection of Flight Simulators by the
DGAC, France which
was dated 24.11.1989. On
22.11.1989 Airbus A-320 simulator registered S 5
of Aeroformation, was inspected. Simulator was
approved for initial training, recurrent training,
precision approaches
(CAT III), LOFT. The simu-
lated aircraft series was A-320 111 and A-320 211
with engines
CFM 56 5. Cockpit layout simulated
was Standard Air Inter (without HUD).
This approval does not indicate that this
simulator could 'be used for training A-320 231
flight crews which are the aircraft operated by
Indian Airlines.

Airbus A-320, VT-EPN, Accident
February 14, 1990
Dear Mr. Khola,
The following is a factual documentation of the work provided
by CASB to date.
1.0(cid:9) Introduction
1.1(cid:9) An Airbus A-320, Indian Airlines flight 605, regis-
tration VT-EPN, crashed during a non precision ap-
proach to Bangalore airport.
1.2(cid:9) The aircraft's digital Flight Data Recorder (DFDR)
was hand carried to the Engineering Branch of the
Canadian Aviation Safe:y Board (CASB; by a team of
three officials of the Government of India after a
request for playback was made by the Indian Govern-
ment througlithe Indian High Commission in Ottawa,
Canada.(cid:9) After initial discussions between CASB and
the Indian team on Monday February 19, 1990, the
work of playing back the recorder began on Tuesday,
February 20, 1990.
1.3(cid:9) The DFDR was a Fairchild model 17M-800-251 digital
recorder (serial number 3768).(cid:9) The DFDR recorded
216 parameters within the 64.fifteen bit word per
second structure,
1.5(cid:9) A flight recorder specialist from the National Tran-
sportation Safety Board (United States) and the
National Research Council of Canada participated in
the playback as advisors to the CASB in order to
ensure the accuracy of the data.

2.0(cid:9)
4.1(cid:9) The magnetic tape medium was removed from the DFDR
for playback. The tape was- cut just before the re-
cord heads such that the physical end of the tape
represented the end of continuous data. After re-
moval of the tape, the DFDR was powered up to deter-
mine the last recorded track. Track 114 (of the six
track tape) was determined to be the last recorded
track.
4.2(cid:9) At approximately five and a half minutes back into
the last flight, an arbitrary reference time was set
to zero which is referred to.as 'Reference Time' on
all of the data plots.
4.4(cid:9) The data were converted to engineering units using
the standard conversion equations for this par-
ticular aircraft. Data from the maiden flight of
VT-EPN was recovered from another- tape made avail-
able---to-tire—CASB by Airbus Industrie to confirm the
ccnversions.(cid:9) The data of the maiden flight played
back through CASB's system provided the same numeri-
cal results and sign conventions as the Airbus In-
dustrie printout of the maiden flight, thus con-
firming the conversions were the same.
4.5(cid:9) The DFDR records the data in 15 bit words which
require mapping into 12 bit words prior to con-
version to engineering units. For the last five
minutes'(cid:9) all of the subframes of data contained the
proper number of bits (64 15 bit words or 960 bits)
except for the subframe corresponding to reference
time 329. This subframn was short six bits (954).
The NRZ signal was analyzed and it was evident that
the signal had experienced expansion and compression
distortion after approximately three quarters of the
way through the suLframe. This distortion was
considered to be as a result of vibrations induced
by the aircraft's impact with terrain. The data
from this dubframe can probably be recovered through
analysis of the NRZ waveform. Additionally, a por-
tion of a second after reference time 330 can prob-
ably be recovered. The recorder stopped somewhere
between reference time 330 and 331.
4.6(cid:9) During the process of mapping the 15 bit data into
12 bit data for the last five and one half minutes,
19 mappings (19 seconds) did not conform to the
allowable mapping patterns for this type of code.
Such data losses are not uncommon and most of these
data losses can be recovered with CASn's systems,
given time.

The CASH has provided data plots and printouts of
the last five and one half minutes of flight, ex-
cepting the above mentioned data losses, which show
up as blank data in the printout.
5.0(cid:9)
Additional Work to Complete if Required
5.1(cid:9)
The bad mapped data areas and the area where the
signal has been distorted due to severe vibration
can he studied in an attempt to gain 1-00% data re-
covery of the last five and a half minutes of
flight.(cid:9) The partial second after the last valid
synchronization code may also be recovered.
5.2(cid:9)
A three dimensional real time flight reconstruction
could be made to facilitate detailed analysis of the
sequence of events during the approach. The CVR
would be advantageous in for integrating with the
flight reconstruction.
5.3(cid:9)
A final report detailing the entire DFDR work done
by CASH including the additional work suggested
above could be prepared.

INTRODUCTION
On February 14, 1990, an Airbus A-320, Indian
1.1(cid:9)
Airlines flight 605,(cid:9) registration VT-EPN,(cid:9) crashed
during a non-precision approach to Bangalore
airport.
The aircraft's Digital Flight Data Recorder (DFDR)
1.2(cid:9)
was hand carried to the Engineering Branch of the
Canadian Transportation Accident Investigation and
Safety Board (CTAISB) by a team of three officials
of the Government of, India after a request for
playback was made by the Indian Government through
the Indian.High Commission in Ottawa, Canada. After
initial discussions between CTAISB and the Indian
team on Monday February 19, 1990,(cid:9) the work of
playing back the recorder began on Tuesday, February
20, 1990.
The DFDR was a Fairchild model 17M-600-251 digital
1.3(cid:9)
recorder (serial number 3766).(cid:9) The DFDR recorded
216 parameters in a standard 64 words per second
format.
Flight Recorder Specialists from the. National Trans-
1.5(cid:9)
portation Safety Board (United States) and from the
National Research Council of Canada participated in
the playback as adviscrs to the CTAISB.
At the request of the India Government, this report
1.6(cid:9)
contains no analysis of the flight in terms of air-
craft operation or performance.
2.0(cid:9) DFDR PLAYBACK
The magnetic tape medium was removed(cid:9) from the DFDR
2.1(cid:9)
for playback. The tape was cut just before the re-
cord heads such that the physical end of the tape
represented the end of continuous data. After re-
moval of the tape, the DFDR was powered up to deter-
mine the last recorded track. Track 04 (of the six
track tape) was determined to be the last recorded
track.
At approximately five and a half minutes back into
2.2(cid:9)
the last flight, an arbitrary reference time was set
to zero which is referred to as 'Reference Time' on
all of the data plots.
The data were converted..to enytneering units using
2.4(cid:9)
the standard conversion equations for this par-
ticular aircraft. Data from the maiden flight of
VT-CPU was recovered from another tape made avail-
544

(cid:9)(cid:9)
EP 36/90
able to the CTAISB by Airbus Industrie to confirm
the conversions.(cid:9) The data of the maiden flight
played back through CTAISB's system provided the
same numerical results and sign conventions as the
Airbus Industrie printout of the maiden flight, thus
confirming the conversions were the same.
2.5(cid:9)
This particular DFDR r7gords the data in 15 bit
words which require Mapping into 12 bit words prior
to conversion to engineering units.(cid:9) For the last
five minutes, all of the subframes (one subframe is
one second) of data contained the proper number of
bits(cid:9) (64 fifteen bit words or 96a bits) except for
the subframe corresponding to reference-time 329.
This subframe was short six bits.(cid:9) The DFDR signal
was analyzed and it was evident that the signal had
experienced expansion and compression distortion
after(cid:9) approximately three quarters of - the way
through(cid:9) the(cid:9) subframe.(cid:9) This. _distortion(cid:9) was
considered to be as a result - of vibrations induced
by the aircraft's impact with terrain. The data
irom this subframe was subsequently recovered
through(cid:9) analysis(cid:9) of(cid:9) the(cid:9) DFDR(cid:9) waveform.
Additionally,(cid:9) a portion of a second after reference
time 331 was also recovered.(cid:9) The recorder was
determined to have stopped at 331 25/64. 25 words
were recorded in the 64 word format prior to the end
of recording,:
2.6(cid:9)
During the process of mapping the 15 bit data into
12 bit data for the last five and one half minutes,
19 mappings (19 seconds) did not conform to the
allowable mapping patterns for this type of code. A
subsequent run of the tape, after fine tuning of our
playback system for this specific recording, re-
sulted in no bad mappings during the last five and
one half minutes.
2.7(cid:9)
The data plots and printouts of the last five and
one half minutes of flight are attached as Appendix
'A' of this report.
2.0 On March 6, 1990,(cid:9) the Indian Government requested
additional data from a previous landing at
Bangalore.(cid:9) A review of past flights on the 25 hour
DFDR revealed that the sixth flight back was also an
approach to Bangalore. Data were therefore plotted
and printed for the sixth flight back and forwarded
to India. These printouts and plots are contained
in Appendix 'B' of this report.

3.0(cid:9) FLIGHT RECONSTPUCTION AND FLIGHT PATH ANALYSIS
3.1(cid:9) A three-dimensional flight reconstruction was made
for the final approach to Bangalore. The flight
path was determined by integrating the recorded
ground speed in the direction of recorded magnetic
heading.(cid:9) Appendix(cid:9) contains examples of figures
taken from the flight reconstruction. A VHS (PAL or
NTSC) video tape is available depicting various
views of the flight in real time with the cockpit
voice recording (CVR) synchronized to it.
3:2(cid:9) The CVR tape provided by the Indian Government on
'uesday, April 17. 1990 was played back at the
CTAISB laboratory at its standard speed and it was
determined that the 400 hertz aircraft power was
displaying as 384 hertz. The CVR was the.refore
played back 4% faster and a copy tape was made while
a simultaneous real time code was written to the
copy tape. The time code, correlated to DFDR
reference time, is shown on the partial CVR
transcript provided in Appendix 'D'.) The transcript
for the CVR was obtained from the fnclian Government
and was therefore not necessarily the CTAISB's
interpretation of the CVR's contents.
3.3(cid:9) (The DFDR and the CVR were aligned such that the
crash sound on the CVR occurred at reference time
329.8,(cid:9) the time.at which an impact occurred on the
DFDR as evidenced by the normal acceleration and the
distortion of the DFDR waveform signal.(cid:9) This time
Matched well with the ;HF keying and the radio
altitude calls by the aircraft.)
3.4(cid:9) The altitude for the flight reconstruction was
determined by plotting the(cid:9) radio altitude and the
pressure altitude on the same scales and attempting
to correlate the two (Figures 2a and 2b of Appendix
'A').(cid:9) The pressure altitude was matched to the
radio altitude of 12 feet at time 328 ('subtracting
2830 feet). The values of pressure altitude at 329
and 330 were set to the corresponding radio altitude
values as the pressure altitude values were
obviously in error, probably due to ground effect
and impact. The aircraft was 'flown' for the
purposes of flight reconstruction, with the pressure
altitude, matched tO the radio altitude and
corrected for the last two pressure altitude values
which were determined to bkiinvalid.
3.5(cid:9) The reported description of the crash site suggested
546

(cid:9)(cid:9)
EP 36/90
that there were two distinct impacts, the first
being a 'light' touchdown of the main gear on
relatively flat terrain and the second being a
harder hit, just prior to a small hill which the
aircraft contacted.(cid:9) Analysis of the DFDI1 data,
(pressure altitude, oad„io altitude, normal ac-
celeration, and aanding gear squat switches) the
distorted waveform signal in subframe 329 and the
single crash sound on the CVR,(cid:9) indicated that only
the first impact was recorded and not the second.
The CecoLding continued for about one and one half
seconds and then ended, on both recorders, without
recording a second impact.
)1.6(cid:9) The normal acceleration data after subframe 329
suggested that the aircraft was in a bounce, after
the first impact, when the recording stopped. The
first impact was therefore consideted sufficient to
have caused internal damage to the aircraft, which
affected the operation of both recorders. After
subframe 329, thL side stick pitch controllers for
both crew went to exactly the same number (-9.51
degrees).(cid:9) It would be highly coincidental that both
side sticks were moved to the same value. It is
considered more likely that the aircraft was
'broken'(cid:9) ih some manner which caused the system to
malfunction.(cid:9) Additionally, the engine values which
reflect a spooling up of the engines, deviate from a
spool up after sdbframe 329.(cid:9) The engine values,
side stick controller pitch data, lack of a second
impact recorded in normal acceleration, single crash
sound on the CVR, and lack of a squat switch signal
prior to subframe 329, all indicate the the first
impact with. the ground occurred in subframe 329 and
no secOnd impact was recorded. The data could not
be fi.t to a scenario in which subframe 329 was the
second impact, just prior to the hill.
3.7(cid:9) For the purposes of the flight reconstruction the
following parameters were displayed as they were
perceived to be significantly related to the
accident:(cid:9) time; computed airspeed;(cid:9) radio altitude;
pitch attitude; both side stick controllers;
auto-pilot 1; altitude capture 1; auto throttle
speed mode; ground proximity warning system; left

ADDITIONAL DFDR ASSISTANCE
4.1(cid:9)
On Tuesday, April 17, 1990, two representatives From
the Indian Government arrived with a second DEUR
tape(cid:9)
from another A320, VT-EPO.(cid:9)
This aircraft was
involved in a go-around on February 27, 1990 (flight
time 6:10 to 7:554.
, WiEhin the flight, there were
two touch apd goes and one go-around.
(cid:9) The engine
parameters for all three of these cases of engine
power application are included in Appendix 'E'
(cid:9) of
this report.
5.0(cid:9) CONCLUSIONS
5.1
The data were recovered from two DFDR's (VT-EPN and
subsequently VT-EPO) as requested by the Indian
Government.
5.2
The data quality for both recordings was considered
excellent.
5.3
All of the data were provided in numerical pint out
-
format as well as graphical plots. A three-dimen-
sional(cid:9)
flight reconstruction was also made of(cid:9)
the
accident serquence.
5.4(cid:9)
The DFDR only recorded one impact which was deter
mined to be the first impact with the ground.

Dear Mr. K. Prabhakar Rao,
Concerning the queries you raised in your letter dated Sep-
tember 15, 1990 concerning data quality after subframe 329,
it was noted that the nbn-return-to-zero waveform of the
DFDR, which represents 'ones' and 'zeros' was distorted
during subframe 329. The distortion was considered to be due
to severe vibration (due to aircraft impact with the ground)
which caused the signal to expand and contract in the time
domain (x-axis). The signal was analyzed and corrected until
the proper number of bits (960) was reached, without regard
for what the parameter values should be. subframe 330 had a
valid synchronizationt
word at the beginning of the subframe
and the next one in sequence at the beginning of subframe
331.(cid:9)
The recording ended part way through subframe 331,
during the 26'th word where the signal was again distorted
and it was determined that old data from 25 hours earlier
began.
The data which follows trends show,'
nnerally be considered
valid,(cid:9)
right through to the end
o1 . _ording. Most of the
data does, in fact, appear to follow trends (it is not way
off).(cid:9)
While the data may be considered valid, it is import-
ant to realize that, after the impact during subframe 329,
the source (signal from the transducer or electronic busses)
of the data may no longer be representing reality, even
though the DFDR appears to record a valid word. As this is
likely impossible to determine absolutely, one can only judge
the data by the trends it is following and try to assess it
as it relates to the accident.
As for vertical acceleration which was specifically queried,
it appears to follow a believable trend and
I think that it .
is therefore most probably valid,(cid:9)
including the value of
6.J25 g during the end of subframe 329.
(cid:9) The vertical ac-
celeration is recorded eight times lasecond and it can be a
very dynamic parameter by nature.(cid:9)
It is .possible that the
(cid:9)
Canada
551

impact at 329 was greater than 6.125 g but was not recorded
due to the sampling rate of eight times per second.
I hope that this additional clarification assists you in your
investigation.(cid:9) I also hope you can appreciate that it is
difficult for us to assess or validate the data any further,
unless we have the benefit of participating in a thorough
analysis of the data as it relates to the accident sequence.
At the beginning of this investigation,(cid:9) it was strongly in-
dicated by your government representatives that you did not
require nor wish us to participate in an analysis of the
data.(cid:9) While our report (EP36/90) did contain some analysis
of the data, it was the minimum amount of analysis we con-
sidered acceptable to accompany the data under the cir-
cumstances.
Sincerely,

When I agreed on 15th February
1990 to be the
Court of Inquiry, with the then Acting Chief
Justice Sri Rama Jois, I had no idea of
the intricate
questions that may come up before me during the
investigation. As a sitting Judge of the High
Court,
I agreed to share the resnonsibility of
the High Court in this regard.
2.
The Court of Inquiry is grateful to
the Scientists at NAL, Bangalore, and
it narti-
cular to Prof. Narasimha, Dr. Nagabhushan,
Dr. Adige, Mr. Muralidhar and Mr. Viswanathan.
At NAL theCVR was replayed on several occasions
with several channels. The Scientists wonted
even beyond office hours, including on a few
holidays. The UV recordings and censtrum
analysis of the sound was an onerous exnerilpent.
It has shown that even the sound emanating from
a narticular object or of
E nerson's voice
can
be identified scientifically.
3. The Indian Airforce Headquarters and the
Officers of the Institute of Aerosnace Medicine
at ilangalore rendered valuable assistance in many
relevant areas.
4. At the outset I acicnowledge'the industry and
577

and punctualities shown throughout by the staff
attached to the Court of Inquiry. Sri A. Vijaya-
murthy, Asst.Registrar of the High Court organised
the entire set un, sunervised the working and has
been very helpful to me throughout. He has once
again reinforced his reputation for sincerity,
integrity and industry.
6. Sri :,:uthaiahl
the Court Officer did a
commendable job throughout.
7.
The two Stenogranhers, who recorded the
depositions in the Court, with accuracy and sneed
are N/s. i{aghavendra Unadya and Gowrishankar. In
the work of finalising the Report, they were sunple-
mented by Ns. A. Alice Mary.
8.
Ny Personal Secretary Sri S. Karunakaran
Nair, as usual worked with zeal and promptitude.
9.
I cannot omit mentioning of Sri Chikkarangaiah,
ILy personal attendant.
1C. Lonyble Chief Justice Sri Yohan and earlier,
the Acting Chief Justice Sri Rama Jois saw to it
that the Court of Inquiry functioned comfortably
and smoothly; they, even allowed the user of the
First court Hall (one of our finest Court Halls
an-] LsinLy used by the Hon'ble Chief Justice), by
tLe Court of Incuiry for several weeki.s.
11. Me Assessors were an4,7ihle(cid:9)
WOrKed very
thro'Ignout. I a-,preciated their initial
Ji:fioilty to adust thc-c.selves to the content of sn
578

'Open Court Inquiry' and the formalities of Court
procedure, but all of them were able to adjust
themselves very early.
12. Sri K.P. Rao has been the Secretary to the
Court of Inquiry; in February 1990 he was the
Controller of Airworthiness at Bangalore. During
these; months, he was promoted as the Director of
Airworthiness (Hyderabad). He had to sacrifice his
time as the Director, to discharge his, functions
as the Court's Secretary. He has been throughout
very attentive to the Court, bearing silently the
inconveniences and irksome errands he had to carry
out. His knowledge in Aeronautical Engineering and
experience has helped me to enlighten- many of my
doubts. The office staff of Controller of Airworthi-
ness, Bangalore, also worked without demur, enthu-
siastically, even beyond office hours and during
holidays to supplement the staff provided by the High
Court.
13. The proceedings in the Court attracted wide
publiciti; the Press was present throughout to remind
the coqrt, of the magnitude of the problem and enor-
mous public interest involved.
14. I had to visit the Central Training Establish-
ment of the Indian Airlines at Hyderabad, on several
occasions to acquaint myself with some asnects of
flying. The Director and others were very courteous
and helpful, throughout. At no time any one of them
touched the basic question before the Court of
Inquiry; they always guarded themselves against
579

embarrassing the Court. The High Court of Andhra
Rradesli and the State Government of Andhra Pradesh
looked after my comforts as their favoured guest
during my stay at Hyderabad.
15.(cid:9) The Assessors have been throughout avail-
able and devoted their entire energy to aid the
investigation.
Cap t. C, R. S.Rao is a retired Director
of Training, Flight Operations and Flight Safety,
Air India; he was also an ace pilot with a blemis11-
less career.
Sri S. G. Goswami retired as a Director
of Airworthiness with vast experience in engi-
neering aspects of aircrafts.
Cap t. B. S. Gop al the youngest among
the -Assessors, is presently, Director of Air Safety,
Air India. He became a Graduate of Institution
of In gin eers and la ter an Associate Man ber and
Member of the Institute; a qualification equated
to B.& degree; his subjects of study included
Aeronautics Theory & Design of Structures and
Thermo Dynamics and Heat Engines; his training
and working experiences are manifold. lie has
been a pilot in B-707, B-7471 A-300 and A-310
as PIC; he had, also, flown aircrafts of the
Indian Air Force as a Volunteer when there was
shortage of pilots in the Air Force. His
industry, devotion to work and curiosity to know
cannot 'on easily matched.

16. Sri V. 8.Arunachalam, Scientific Advisor
to the Ministry of Defence and Commodore Ray of
A. D. E. Bangalore", Air Commodore Su rj ith Sin,gh,
I.A.M. Bangalore and his Officers were
very helpful to the Assessors.
The finding as to the probable cause and
17.
circumstances of the crash is not to blame anyone;
purpose is to take ranedial measures to prevent
recurrence of such accidents; the basic cause tf`
the crash can be conveyed in the words of an
author:
"The moments we forego,
Eternity itself cannot retrieve".
